Risk Factors\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to achieve our goals. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may ultimately materially affect our business.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas involve highly regulated, high-risk activities with many uncertainties and contingencies that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The risks and uncertainties described below are among the items we have identified that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Before you invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk factors referenced below and as more fully described in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Industry\nThere are significant uncertainties with respect to obtaining permits for oil and gas activities in Kern County, where all of our California operations are located, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Attempts by the California state government to restrict the production of oil and gas could negatively impact our operations and result in decreased demand for fossil fuels within the states where we operate.\n\u2022Our ability to operate profitably and maintain our business and financial condition are highly dependent on commodity prices, which historically have been very volatile and are driven by numerous factors beyond our control. If oil prices were to significantly decline for a prolonged period our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\u2022The marketability of our production is dependent upon the availability of transportation and storage facilities, most of which we do not control. If we are unable to access such facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our access to markets for the commodities we produce could be restricted, which would likely cause interruption to operations, curtailment of production, and reduced revenues, among other adverse consequences.\n\u2022Estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\n\u2022Unless we replace oil and natural gas reserves, our future reserves and production will decline.\n\u2022The drilling and production of oil and natural gas involves many uncertainties, some of which we do not control, that could adversely affect our results.\n\u2022We may not drill our identified sites at the times we scheduled or at all.\n\u2022Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil or natural gas and secure trained personnel.\n\u2022We may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets or enter into attractive joint ventures, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\n\u2022We are dependent on our cogeneration facilities to produce steam for our operations. Contracts for the sale of surplus electricity, economic market prices and regulatory conditions affect the economic value of these facilities to our operations.\n\u2022Our producing properties are located primarily in California, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this highly regulated geographic area.\n\u2022Most of our operations are in California, much of which is conducted in areas that may be at risk of damage from fire, mudslides, earthquakes or other natural disasters.\n\u2022We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\n\u2022We may be involved in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities.\n\u2022The loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations.\n\u2022Information technology failures and cyberattacks could affect us significantly.\n\u2022Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters may impact our operations and our business.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\n\u2022We may not be able to use a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce our future U.S. federal and state income tax obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\n\u2022Our business requires continual capital expenditures. We may be unable to fund these investments through operating cash flow or obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or production.\n\u2022Inflation could adversely impact our ability to control our costs, including our operating expenses and capital costs.\n\u2022Our hedging activities, including those required by our 2021 RBL facility, limit our ability to realize the full benefits of increases in commodity prices. We may be unable to, or may choose not to, enter into sufficient fixed-price purchase or other hedging agreements to fully protect against decreasing spreads between the price of natural gas and oil on an energy equivalent basis or may otherwise be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of natural gas to conduct our steam operations economically or at desired levels and our commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\n\u2022Our existing debt agreements have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in certain activities. In addition, the borrowing base under the RBL Facility is subject to periodic redeterminations and our lenders could reduce capital available to us for investment.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\u2022We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt arrangements, and these efforts may not be successful.\n\u2022Declines in commodity prices, changes in expected capital development, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets.\n\u2022We have significant concentrations of credit risk with our customers and the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations or the loss of any one of our major oil and natural gas purchasers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\n\u2022Our business is highly regulated and governmental authorities can delay or deny required permits and approvals, or change the requirements governing our operations including the permitting approval process for oil and gas activities that could increase costs, restrict operations, and delay our implementation of, or cause us to change, our business strategy and plans.\n\u2022Potential future legislation may generally affect the taxation of natural gas and oil exploration and development companies and may adversely affect our operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Derivatives legislation and regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the risks associated with our business.\n\u2022Our operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which we may conduct oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, and reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock\n\u2022There may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\n\u2022Our significant stockholders and their affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation could enable our significant stockholders to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\n\u2022Future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\n\u2022The payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors.\n\u2022We may issue preferred stock, the terms of which could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\n\u2022We are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and are able to take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\n\u2022Our internal control over financial reporting is not currently required to meet all of the standards of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act standards could adversely affect our business and share price.\n\u2022Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\n\u2022Our Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\n\u2022Changes in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Industry\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are among the items we have identified that could materially adversely affect our business, production, strategy, growth plans, acquisitions, hedging, reserves quantities or value, operating or capital costs, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, our ability to meet our capital expenditure plans and other obligations and financial commitments, and our plans to return capital.\nThere are significant uncertainties with respect to obtaining permits for oil and gas activities in Kern County, where all of our California operations are located, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur oil and gas operations in California are subject to compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and we cannot receive certain permits and other approval for our operations until a demonstration of compliance with CEQA has been made. There have been a number of developments at both the California state and local level that have resulted in delays in the issuance of permits for oil and gas activities in Kern County, as well as a more time- and cost- intensive permitting process. In we are unable to timely receive the permits and other approvals needed for our 2022 plans, or for our future plans, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely and materially impacted.\nIn Kern County, where all of our California assets are now located, we historically have satisfied CEQA by complying with the local oil and gas ordinance, which was supported by an Environmental Impact Report (\u201cKern County EIR\u201d) covering oil and gas operations in Kern County which was certified by the Kern County Board of Supervisors in 2015. In addition to CalGEM, other state agencies have relied on the Kern County EIR to satisfy the CEQA requirements in connection with permitting and project approval decisions for oil and gas projects in unincorporated Kern County. However, a group of plaintiffs challenged the Kern County EIR, and subsequently the California Fifth District Court of Appeals issued a ruling invalidating a portion of the Kern County EIR until Kern County made certain revisions to the Kern County EIR and recertified it (\u201cKern County Ruling\u201d). To address the Kern County Ruling, Kern County elected to prepare a supplemental EIR which was approved by the Kern County Board of Supervisors in March 2021. Following further challenges by plaintiffs in March 2021, a Kern County Superior Court judge suspended use of the supplemental EIR, stopping the issuance of new oil and gas permits by Kern County (the \u201cKern County Permit Suspension\u201d) in October 2021, pending judicial review of the supplemental EIR and a determination of its compliance with CEQA requirements by the Kern County Superior Court. A hearing on the matter by the Kern County Superior Court is scheduled for April 2022. We cannot predict the outcome of this hearing on the Kern County EIR as supplemented or whether it will result in the imposition of more onerous permit application requirements or other requirements or restrictions on land use and exploration and production activities.\nImportantly, the Kern County Ruling and the Kern County Permit Suspension did not invalidate existing permits and our plans and operations have not been materially impacted to date. Until Kern County is able to resolve the challenges regarding the sufficiency of the Kern County EIR and resume the ability to issue permits, CalGEM is serving as lead agency for CEQA purposes and our ability to obtain new permits and approvals to enable our future plans in Kern County requires demonstrating to CalGEM an alternative way of complying with CEQA. Demonstrating compliance with CEQA independently - without being able to reference the Kern County EIR - is a more technically, time and cost intensive process and may, among other things, require that we conduct an environmental impact review. As a result, we together with other Kern County operators have experienced delays in the issuance of permits by CalGEM, as well as a more time- and cost- intensive permitting process. We believe that we currently have sufficient permit inventory to cover our drilling plan through the first quarter of 2022. However, our 2022 plans may be impacted by our ability to timely obtain the required permits and approvals to conduct planned operations through the remainder of the year, particularly if the Kern County Permit Suspension continues or if there are further delays in or new restrictions imposed upon the issuance or renewal of permits covering oil and gas activities in Kern County. If we are unable to obtain the required permits and approvals needed to conduct our operations on a timely basis or at all our financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely and materially impacted.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSeparately, in February 2021, the Center for Biological Diversity filed suit against CalGEM alleging that its reliance on the Kern County EIR for oil and gas decisions violates CEQA, and that an independent environmental impact review in compliance with CEQA is required by CalGEM before the agency can issue oil and gas permits and approvals. The lawsuit is ongoing and we cannot predict its ultimate outcome or whether it could result in changes to CalGEM\u2019s requirements for compliance with CEQA, even if the Kern County EIR is ultimately deemed sufficient and reinstated. The potential impact of this and potentially future litigation contributes to the uncertainty with respect to future requirements for demonstrating compliance with CEQA and therefore our ability to timely obtain the permits and approvals needed to conduct our operations.\nChanges to the CEQA compliance requirements or the other conditions and requirements for permit issuance or renewal, including the imposition of new or more stringent environmental reviews or stricter operational or monitoring requirements, or a prohibition on the issuance of new permits for oil and has activities in Kern County or California as a whole, would have an adverse and material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. For additional information, see \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Regulation of Health, Safety and Environmental Matters\u201d.\nAttempts by the California state government to restrict the production of oil and gas could negatively impact our operations and result in decreased demand for fossil fuels within the states where we operate.\nCalifornia, where most of our operations and assets are located, is one of the most heavily regulated states in the United States with respect to oil and gas operations. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern most aspects of exploration and production in California. Collectively, the effect of the existing laws and regulations is to potentially limit the number and location of our wells through restrictions on the use of our properties, limit our ability to develop certain assets and conduct certain operations, and reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells below levels that would otherwise be possible. Several bills have been introduced recently but failed to advance in the California State Legislature that restrict or prohibit the issuance or renewal of permits for various well stimulation and recovery techniques. Although these legislative efforts have failed, we cannot predict the outcome of future efforts. What's more, the regulatory burden on the industry increases our costs and consequently may have an adverse effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Violations and liabilities with respect to these laws and regulations could result in significant administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages, permit modifications or revocations, operational interruptions or shutdowns and other liabilities. The costs of remedying such conditions may be significant, and remediation obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdditionally, the California state government recently has taken several actions that could adversely impact future oil and gas production and other activities in the state. For example:\n\u2022In November 2019, the State Department of Conservation issued a press release announcing three actions by CalGEM: (1) a moratorium on approval of new high-pressure cyclic steam wells pending a study of the practice to address surface expressions experienced by certain operators; (2) a review and update of regulations regarding public health and safety near oil and natural gas operations pursuant to additional duties assigned to CalGEM by the California State Legislature in 2019 (discussed above); (3) a performance audit of CalGEM's permitting processes for issuing WST permits and project approval letters (\u201cPALs\u201c) for underground injection activities by the State Department of Finance; and (4) an independent review of the technical content of pending WST and PAL applications by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In January 2020, CalGEM issued a formal notice to operators, including us, that they had issued restrictions imposing the previously announced moratorium to prohibit new underground oil-extraction wells from using high-pressure cyclic steaming process. The moratorium on permitting for new high-pressure cyclic steam wells and restrictions on WST remains in effect.\n\u2022In September 2020, the California Governor issued an executive order that seeks to reduce both the supply of and demand for fossil fuels in the state. The executive order established several goals and directed several state agencies to take certain actions with respect to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to: (1) phasing out the sale of emissions-producing vehicles; (2)\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\ndeveloping strategies for the closure and repurposing of oil and gas facilities in California; and (3) calling on the California State Legislature to enact new laws prohibiting hydraulic fracturing in the state by 2024. The executive order also directed CalGEM to finish its review of public health and safety concerns from the impacts of oil extraction activities and propose significantly strengthened regulations.\n\u2022In October 2020, the California Governor issued an executive order that established a state goal to conserve at least 30% of California\u2019s land and coastal waters by 2030 and directed state agencies to implement other measures to mitigate climate change and strengthen biodiversity. At this time, we cannot predict the potential future actions that may result from this order or how such may potentially impact our operations.\n\u2022In October 2021, CalGEM released for public comment a \u201cdiscussion draft\u201d proposed regulation that would prohibit new wells and facilities within a 3,200-foot setback area from homes, schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and other sensitive locations. The proposed regulation would also require pollution controls for existing wells and facilities within the same 3,200-foot setback area. CalGEM is currently in the process of conducting an economic analysis of the proposed rule. Following this analysis, CalGEM will submit a proposed rule to the Office of Administrative Law and will begin an additional process of receiving formal comments and refinement of the proposal as needed before a final rule can be issued. We continue to assess the impacts of this rule, and we currently anticipate that approximately 29% of our acreage could be impacted by the setback requirements if finalized as proposed.\nIn February 2021, California State Senators Scott Wiener and Monique Lim\u00f3n introduced Senate Bill 467, which proposes to halt the issuance or renewal of permits for hydraulic fracturing, acid well stimulation treatments, cyclic steaming, and water and steam flooding starting January 1, 2022, and then prohibit these extraction methods entirely starting January 1, 2027. SB 467 also would have prohibited all new or renewed permits for oil and gas extraction within 2,500 feet of any homes, schools, healthcare facilities or long-term care institutions such as dormitories or prisons, by January 1, 2022. However, SB 467 never made it out of committee and other bills to limit well stimulation treatments have also previously been introduced and failed to pass through the California legislature. Although these legislative efforts have failed, it is possible that SB 467 or similar legislation could be reintroduced in the future and we cannot predict the results of such future efforts. While currently none of our California operations rely on hydraulic fracturing stimulation they do rely on other methods of well stimulation and injection, including cyclic steaming and water and steam flooding. Any restrictions on the use of those well stimulation treatments or other forms of injection may adversely impact our operations, including causing operational delays, increased costs, and reduced production, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and net cash provided by operating activities. For additional information on regulatory and legislative risks in California that could adversely impact our operations. See \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Regulation of Health, Safety and Environmental Matters.\u201d\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related developments in the global oil markets had material adverse consequences for general economic, business and industry conditions and impacted the Company's operations, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and those of its purchasers, suppliers and other counterparties.\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility in the financial markets. In addition, the onset of the pandemic resulted in widespread travel restrictions, business closures and other restrictions that led to a significant reduction in demand for oil, NGL and gas, resulting in oil prices declining significantly beginning in the first quarter or 2020. In response to the reduced demand for, and prices of, crude oil, we reduced our 2020 planned capital expenditures by more than 50%, which negatively impacted production for that year.\nWhile demand for and prices for oil, NGLs and gas generally improved during 2021 and into 2022 as travel restrictions, business closures and other restrictions were lifted, an increase in infections or the onset of a new variant of the virus could again reduce demand for and prices of oil, NGLs and gas. Persistently weak or additional declines in commodity prices could adversely affect the economics of our existing wells and planned future wells,\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nresult in additional impairment charges to existing properties, and, similar to steps we took in 2020 after the onset of the pandemic, cause us to reduce expenditures and delay or abandon planned drilling operations resulting in production declines, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, cash flows, and the quantity and value of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties.\nOur operations also may be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce - and that of our customers and suppliers - are unable to work effectively, because of illnesses, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. Although we managed the transition to temporary work from home arrangements and subsequent office re-openings without a significant loss in business continuity, we incurred additional costs and experienced some inefficiencies during the year as a result. If the ongoing outbreak were to worsen, and additional restrictions are implemented, certain operational and other business processes could slow which may result in longer time to execute critical business functions, higher operating costs and uncertainties regarding the quality of services and supplies, any of which could adversely affect our operating results for as long as the current pandemic persists and potentially for some time after the pandemic subsides.\nOur ability to operate profitably and maintain our business and financial condition are highly dependent on commodity prices, which historically have been very volatile and are driven by numerous factors beyond our control. The outbreak of COVID-19 followed by certain actions taken by OPEC+ caused crude oil prices to decline significantly beginning in the first quarter of 2020, and prices remained below pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period before they recovered. If oil prices were to significantly decline again for a prolonged period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, value of our reserves, access to capital and future rate of growth, among other factors. However, the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including not limited to, the following:\n\u2022changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas, including changes in demand resulting from general and specific economic conditions relating to the business cycle and other factors (e.g., global health epidemics such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic);\n\u2022the actions of OPEC and/or OPEC+;\n\u2022the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022political conditions, including embargoes, in or affecting other oil-producing activity;\n\u2022the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity\n\u2022the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022weather conditions;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental legislative efforts, executive actions and regulations, including environmental regulations, climate change regulations and taxation;\n\u2022the effect of energy conservation efforts;\n\u2022stockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of capital for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and gas;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels.\nHistorically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been extremely volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. When the U.S. and global economies experience weakness, demand for\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nenergy will decline with accompanying declines in commodity prices; similarly, when growth in global energy production outstrips demand, the excess supply results in commodity price declines.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, the availability and cost of credit and slow economic growth in the United States have in the past contributed to significantly reduced economic activity and diminished expectations for the global economy. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad were deteriorate, worldwide demand for petroleum products could further diminish, which could impact the price at which oil, natural gas and NGLs from our properties are sold, affect our level of operations and ultimately materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and free cash flow.\nAdditionally, although the California market generally receives Brent-influenced pricing, California oil prices are determined ultimately by local supply and demand dynamics. Even as Brent pricing reached a historic low during the second quarter of 2020, we also experienced an adverse widening in the price differential between Brent and the California benchmark due to the lack of local demand and storage capacity. Although market conditions and the differential improved over the latter half of 2021, California pricing remained below pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period.\nPast declines in pricing, and any declines that may occur in the future, can be expected to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such declines adversely affect well and reserve economics and may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically, resulting in deferral or cancellation of planned drilling and related activities until such time, if ever, as economic conditions improve sufficiently to support such operations. Any extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and storage facilities and other facilities, most of which we do not control, and the availability of such transportation and storage capabilities. If we are unable to access such facilities on commercially reasonable terms, our operations would likely be interrupted, our production could be curtailed, and our revenues reduced, among other adverse consequences.\nThe marketing of oil, natural gas and NGLs production depends in large part on the availability, proximity and capacity of trucks, pipelines and storage facilities, gas gathering systems and other transportation, processing and refining facilities, as well as the existence of adequate markets. Storage and transportation capacity for our production is limited and may become unavailable on commercially reasonable terms or at all. For example, storage and transportation capacity became scarce during the second quarter of 2020 due to the unprecedented dual impact of a severe global oil demand decline coupled with a substantial increase in supply. As traditional tanks filled, large quantities of oil were being stored in offshore tankers around the world, including off the coast of California. Where storage was available, such as offshore tankers, storage costs increased sharply. The potential risk remains that storage for oil may be unavailable and our existing capacity may be insufficient to support planned production rates in the event of another deterioration in demand or a supply surge or both.\nMoreover, if the imbalance between supply and demand and the related shortage of storage capacity worsen, the prices we receive for our production could deteriorate and could potentially even become negative. Additionally, if we were unable to obtain the needed storage capacity, we could be forced to shut-in a significant amount of our California production, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and operational results. If we are forced to shut in production, we would incur additional costs to bring the associated wells back online. While production is shut in, we would likely incur additional costs and operating expenses to, among other things, maintain the health of the reservoirs, meet contractual obligations and protect our interests, without the associated revenue. Additionally, depending on the duration of the shut-in, and whether we have also shut in steam injection for the associated reservoirs rather than incur those costs, the wells may not, initially or at all, come back online at similar rates to those at the time of shut-in. Depending on the duration of the steam injection shut-in time, and the resulting inefficiency and economics of restoring the reservoir to its energetic and heated state, our proved reserve estimates could be decreased and there could be potential additional impairments and associated\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\ncharges to our earnings. A reduction in our reserves could also result in a reduction to our borrowing base under the RBL Facility and our liquidity. The ultimate significance of the impact of any production disruptions, including the extent of the adverse impact on our financial and operational results, will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will in turn depend on how long storage remains filled and unavailable to us, which is largely unpredictable and based on factors outside of our control.\nIn addition to the constraints we may face due to storage capacity shortages, the volume of oil and natural gas that we can produce is subject to limitations resulting from pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, and physical damage to the gathering, transportation, storage, processing, fractionation, refining or export facilities that we utilize. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months or longer and, in many cases, we may be provided only limited, if any, advance notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any such shut in or curtailment, or any inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields, would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.\nEstimation of reserves and related future net cash flows is a partially subjective process of estimating accumulations of oil and natural gas that includes many uncertainties. Our estimates are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate, including:\n\u2022the similarity of reservoir performance in other areas to expected performance from our assets;\n\u2022the quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;\n\u2022commodity prices;\n\u2022production, operating costs, taxes and costs related to GHG regulations;\n\u2022development costs;\n\u2022the effects of government regulations; and\n\u2022future workover and asset retirement costs.\nMisunderstanding these variables, inaccurate assumptions, changed circumstances or new information could require us to make significant negative reserves revisions.\nWe currently expect improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and, potentially acquisitions, to be our main sources for reserves additions. However, factors such as the availability of capital, geology, government regulations and permits, the effectiveness of development plans and other factors could affect the source or quantity of future reserves additions. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates could materially affect the net present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our borrowing base and liquidity under the RBL Facility, as well as our results of operations.\nUnless we replace oil and natural gas reserves, our future reserves and production will decline.\nUnless we conduct successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Success requires us to deploy sufficient capital to projects that are geologically and economically attractive which is subject to the capital, development, operating and regulatory risks already discussed above under the heading \u201c-Our business requires continual capital expenditures. We may be unable to fund these investments through operating cash flow or obtain any needed additional capital on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or production. Our capital program is also susceptible to risks, including regulatory and permitting risks, that could materially affect its implementation.\u201d The Company reduced its planned capital expenditures in 2020 in response to the effects of COVID-19 and the actions of OPEC+, which negatively impacted production during 2020. While we\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nsubsequently increased our planned capital expenditures for 2021, it is possible that lower-than-expected demand and prices for commodities in the future could materially and adversely affect our future planned capital expenditures. Over the long term, a continuing decline in our production and reserves would reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by reducing our cash flow from operations and the value of our assets.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas involves many uncertainties that could adversely affect our results.\nThe success of our development, production and acquisition activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable production or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves due to:\n\u2022 poor production response;\n\u2022 ineffective application of recovery techniques;\n\u2022 increased costs of drilling, completing, stimulating, equipping, operating, maintaining and abandoning wells;\n\u2022 delays or cost overruns caused by equipment failures, accidents, environmental hazards, adverse weather conditions, permitting or construction delays, title disputes, surface access disputes and other matters; and\n\u2022 misinterpretation of geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies.\nAdditional factors may delay or cancel our operations, including:\n\u2022 delays due to regulatory requirements and procedures, including unavailability or other restrictions limiting permits and limitations on water disposal, emission of GHGs, steam injection and well stimulation, such as California\u2019s recent limitations on cyclic steaming above the fracture gradient;\n\u2022 pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022 shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, qualified personnel or supplies including water for steam used in production or pressure maintenance;\n\u2022 delays in access to production or pipeline transmission facilities; and\n\u2022power outages imposed by utilities which provide a portion of our electricity needs in order to avoid fire hazards and inspect lines in connection with seasonal strong winds, which have begun to occur recently and may impact our operations.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to property, reserves and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination and regulatory penalties.\nWe may not drill our identified sites at the times we scheduled or at all.\nWe have specifically identified locations for drilling over the next several years, which represent a significant part of our long-term growth strategy. Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. Legislative and regulatory developments, such as the California moratorium on approval of new high-pressure cyclic steam wells pending a study of the practice to address surface expressions experienced by certain operators, could prevent us from planned drilling activities. Additionally, as discussed under \u201c-Risks Related to Regulatory Matters,\u201d new regulations and legislative activity could result in a significant delay or decline in, and/or the incurrence of additional costs for, the approval of the permits required to develop our properties in accordance with our plans. If future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail drilling or development of these projects. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that these prospective drilling locations or any other drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to economically produce oil or natural gas from these drilling locations. In addition, some of our leases could\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nexpire if we do not establish production in the leased acreage. The combined net acreage covered by leases expiring in the next three years represented approximately 11% of our total net acreage at December 31, 2021.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil or natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to evaluate, select and acquire suitable properties, market our production and secure skilled personnel to operate our assets in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many of our competitors possess and employ greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets or enter into attractive joint ventures, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nThere is no guarantee we will be able to identify or complete attractive acquisitions. Our capital expenditure budget for 2022 does not allocate any amounts for acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties. If we make acquisitions, we would need to use cash flows or seek additional capital, both of which are subject to uncertainties discussed in this section. Competition may also increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our debt arrangements impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions and to incur certain indebtedness. See \u201c-Our existing debt agreements have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in certain activities.\u201d In addition, the success of completed acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources.\nWe are dependent on our cogeneration facilities to produce steam for our operations. Contracts for the sale of surplus electricity, economic market prices and regulatory conditions affect the economic value of these facilities to our operations.\nWe are dependent on four cogeneration facilities that, combined, provide approximately 18% of our steam capacity and approximately 65% of our field electricity needs in California at a discount to market rates. To further offset our costs, we sell surplus power to California utility companies produced by certain of our cogeneration facilities under long-term contracts. Should we lose, be unable to renew on favorable terms, or be unable to replace such contracts, we may be unable to realize the cost offset currently received. Our ability to benefit from these facilities is also affected by our ability to consistently generate surplus electricity and fluctuations in commodity prices. For example, during 2021 electricity sales increased by $10 million, or 38%, due to higher unit sales during the summer when we receive peak pricing, and higher year-over-year gas pricing. Furthermore, market fluctuations in electricity prices and regulatory changes in California could adversely affect the economics of our cogeneration facilities and any corresponding increase in the price of steam could significantly impact our operating costs. If we were unable to find new or replacement steam sources, lose existing sources or experience installation delays, we may be unable to maximize production from our heavy oil assets. If we were to lose our electricity sources, we would be subject to the electricity rates we could negotiate. For a more detailed discussion of our electricity sales contracts, see \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Operational Overview-Electricity.\u201d\nOur producing properties are located primarily in California, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having operations concentrated in this geographic area.\nWe operate primarily in California, which is one of the most heavily regulated states in the United States with respect to oil and gas operations. This geographic concentration disproportionately affects the success and profitability of our operations exposing us to local price fluctuations, changes in state or regional laws and regulations, political risks, limited acquisition opportunities where we have the most operating experience and infrastructure, limited storage options, drought conditions, and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and transportation capacity constraints, limited potential customers, infrastructure capacity and\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\navailability of rigs, equipment, oil field services, supplies and labor. We discuss such specific risks to our California operations in more detail elsewhere in this section.\nMost of our operations are in California, much of which is conducted in areas that may be at risk of damage from fire, mudslides, earthquakes or other natural disasters.\nWe currently conduct operations in California near known wildfire and mudslide areas and earthquake fault zones. A future natural disaster, such as a fire, mudslide or an earthquake, could cause substantial interruption and delays in our operations, damage or destroy equipment, prevent or delay transport of our products and cause us to incur additional expenses, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our facilities would be difficult to replace and would require substantial lead time to repair or replace. These events could occur with greater frequency as a result of the potential impacts from climate change. The insurance we maintain against earthquakes, mudslides, fires and other natural disasters would not be adequate to cover a total loss of our facilities, may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOperational issues and inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient facilities and services to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise could restrict access to markets for the commodities we produce.\nOur ability to market our production of oil, gas and NGLs depends on a number of factors, including the proximity of production fields to pipelines, refineries and terminal facilities, competition for capacity on such facilities, damage, shutdowns and turnarounds at such facilities and their ability to gather, transport or process our production. If these facilities are unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, we could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons. We rely, and expect to rely in the future, on third-party facilities for services such as storage, processing and transmission of our production. Our plans to develop and sell our reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient facilities and services to us on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. If our access to markets for commodities we produce is restricted, our costs could increase and our expected production growth may be impaired.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of catastrophic events. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not fully insured against all risks. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, are subject to risks such as fires, explosions, oil and natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment, equipment failures and industrial accidents. We are exposed to similar risks indirectly through our customers and other market participants such as refiners. Other catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, mudslides, fires, droughts, contagious diseases, terrorist attacks and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may adversely affect our business and the communities in which we operate. For example, utilities have begun to suspend electric services to avoid wildfires during windy periods in California, a business disruption risk that is not insured. We may be unable to obtain, or may elect not to obtain, insurance for certain risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities.\nLike many oil and natural gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal and other proceedings, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business. Such legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have a material adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of the attention of management and other personnel and other factors. In addition, resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in liability, loss of contractual or other rights, penalties or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices. Accruals for such liability, penalties or sanctions may be insufficient, and judgments and estimates to determine\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\naccruals or range of losses related to legal and other proceedings could change materially from one period to the next.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations.\nWe depend on, and could be deprived of, the services of our senior management and technical personnel. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of services of any of these individuals.\nInformation technology failures and cyberattacks could affect us significantly.\nWe rely on electronic systems and networks to communicate, control and manage our operations and prepare our financial management and reporting information. Without accurate data from and access to these systems and networks, our ability to communicate and control and manage our business could be adversely affected.\nWe face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines, and threats from terrorist acts. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations. If we were to experience an attack and our security measures failed, the potential consequences to our business and the communities in which we operate could be significant and could harm our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business.\nIncreasing attention to, and social expectations on companies to address, climate change and other environmental and social impacts, investor and societal explanations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures, and increased consumer demand for alternative forms of energy may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change and environmental conservation, for example, may result in demand shifts for oil and natural gas products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against us. To the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. While we may participate in various voluntary frameworks and certification programs to improve the ESG profile of our operations and products, we cannot guarantee that such participation or certification will have the intended results on our or our products\u2019 ESG profile.\nMoreover, while we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures will be based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring, and reporting on many ESG matters. Additionally, while we may also announce various voluntary ESG targets in the near future, such targets are aspirational. We may not be able to meet such targets in the manner or on such a timeline as initially contemplated, including, but not limited to as a result of unforeseen costs or technical difficulties associated with achieving such results. To the extent we do meet such targets, it may be achieved through various contractual arrangements, including the purchase of various credits or offsets that may be deemed to mitigate our ESG impact instead of actual changes in our ESG performance. Also, despite these aspirational goals, we may receive pressure from investors, lenders, or other groups to adopt more aggressive climate or other ESG-related goals, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement such goals because of potential costs or technical or operational obstacles.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us or our customers and to the diversion of investment to other industries which could have a negative impact on our stock price and/or our access to and costs of capital. Moreover, to the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, we may not be able to compete as effectively or recruit or retain employees, which may adversely affect our operations.\nSuch ESG matters may also impact our customers or suppliers, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe may not be able to use a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce our future U.S. federal and state income tax obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nWe currently have substantial U.S. federal and state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and U.S. federal general business credits. Our ability to use these tax attributes to reduce our future U.S. federal and state income tax obligations depends on many factors, including our future taxable income, which cannot be assured. In addition, our ability to use NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). Under those sections of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes may be substantially limited.\nDetermining the limitations under Section 382 of the Code is technical and highly complex. A corporation generally will experience an ownership change if one or more stockholders (or groups of stockholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of the corporation\u2019s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. We may in the future undergo an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce our future U.S. federal and state income tax obligations may be materially limited, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nOur business requires continual capital expenditures. We may be unable to fund these investments through operating cash flow or obtain any needed additional capital on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves or production. Our capital program is also susceptible to risks, including regulatory and permitting risks, that could materially affect its implementation.\nOur industry is capital intensive. We have a 2022 capital expenditure budget of approximately $125 to $135 million. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, commodity prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, the availability of permits, and our ability to obtain them in a timely manner or at all, legal and regulatory processes and other restrictions, and technological and competitive developments. A reduction or sustained decline in commodity prices from current levels may force us to reduce our capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production. Current and future laws and regulations may prevent us from being able to execute our drilling programs and development and optimization projects.\nWe expect to fund our 2022 capital expenditures with cash flows from our operations, supplemented by cash on hand which was built as excess Levered Free Cash Flow during 2020 and 2021; however, our cash flows from operations, and access to capital should such cash flows and cash on hand prove inadequate, are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022the volume of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022the prices at which our production is sold and our operating expenses;\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\u2022the success of our hedging program;\n\u2022our proved reserves, including our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022our ability to borrow under the RBL Facility;\n\u2022and our ability to access the capital markets.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under the RBL Facility decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, lack of required permits and other operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations and growth at current levels. If additional capital were needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any additional debt financing would carry interest costs, diverting capital from our business activities, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production. If cash flows generated by our operations or available borrowings under the RBL Facility were not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our properties. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nInflation could adversely impact our ability to control our costs, including our operating expenses and capital costs.\nAlthough inflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years, it rose significantly in the second half of 2021. This is believed to be the result of the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the global supply chain disruptions and the government stimulus packages, among other factors. Global, industry-wide supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in shortages in labor, materials and services. Such shortages have resulted in inflationary cost increases for labor, materials and services and could continue to cause costs to increase as well as scarcity of certain products and raw materials. We are experiencing some inflationary pressure for certain costs, including employees and vendors, although such cost increases did not materially impact our 2021 financial condition or results of operations, and we currently do not expect them to materially impact our 2022 financial results or operations. However, to the extent elevated inflation remains, we may experience further cost increases for our operations, including natural gas purchases and oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil, natural gas and NGL prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations, as well as increased labor costs. An increase in oil, natural gas and NGL prices may cause the costs of materials and services to rise. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation and a significant increase in inflation, to the extent we are unable to recover higher costs through higher commodity prices and revenues, would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur hedging activities limit our ability to realize the full benefits of increases in commodity prices and our potential gains.\nWe enter into hedges to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas, mitigate our economic exposure to commodity price volatility and ensure our financial strength and liquidity by protecting our cash flows. In addition, we also hedge to meet the hedging requirements of the 2021 RBL Facility. The 2021 RBL Facility requires us to maintain commodity hedges (other than three-way collars) on minimum notional volumes of (i) at least 75% of our reasonably projected production of crude oil from our PDP reserves, for 24 full calendar months after the effective date of the 2021 RBL Facility and after each May 1 and November 1 of each calendar year (each, a \u201cMinimum Hedging Requirement Date\u201d) and (ii) at least 50% of our reasonably projected production of crude oil from our PDP reserves, for each full calendar month during the period from and including the 25th full calendar month following each such Minimum Hedging Requirement Date through and including the 36th full calendar month following each such Minimum Hedging Requirement Date; provided, that in the case of each of the above clauses (i) and (ii), the notional volumes hedged are deemed reduced by the notional volumes of any short puts or other similar derivatives having the effect of exposing us to commodity price risk below the \u201cfloor\u201d. In addition to minimum hedging requirements and other restrictions in respect of hedging described therein,\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nthe 2021 RBL Facility contains restrictions on our commodity hedging which prevent us from entering into hedging agreements (i) with a tenor exceeding 48 months or (ii) for notional volumes which (when aggregated with other hedges then in effect other than basis differential swaps on volumes already hedged) exceed, as of the date such hedging agreement is executed, 90% of our reasonably projected production of crude oil from our PDP reserves, for each month following the date such hedging agreement is entered into, provided that the volume limitations above do not apply to short puts or put options contracts that are not related to corresponding calls, collars, or swaps.\nWhile intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices, such transactions, depending on the hedging instrument used, may limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge or expose us to the risk of financial losses depending on commodity price movements and other circumstances. Our ability to realize the benefits of our hedges also depends in part upon the counterparties to these contracts honoring their financial obligations. If any of our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations in the future, we could be exposed to increased cash flow volatility that could affect our liquidity.\nWe may be unable to, or may choose not to, enter into sufficient fixed-price purchase or other hedging agreements to fully protect against decreasing spreads between the price of natural gas and oil on an energy equivalent basis or may otherwise be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of natural gas to conduct our steam operations economically or at desired levels, and our commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nTo develop our heavy oil in California we must economically generate steam using natural gas. We seek to reduce our exposure to the potential unavailability of, pricing increases for, and volatility in pricing of, natural gas by entering into fixed-price purchase agreements and other hedging transactions. We seek to reduce our exposure to potential price increases and volatility in pricing of oil by entering into swaps, calls and other hedging transactions. We may be unable to, or may choose not to, enter into sufficient agreements to fully protect against decreasing spreads between the price of natural gas and oil on an energy equivalent basis or may otherwise be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of natural gas to conduct our steam operations economically or at desired levels.\nIn addition, we also hedge to meet the hedging requirements of the 2021 RBL Facility, which requires us to maintain commodity hedges (other than three-way collars) on minimum notional volumes of (i) at least 75% of our reasonably projected production of crude oil from our PDP reserves, for 24 full calendar months after the effective date of the 2021 RBL Facility and after each May 1 and November 1 of each calendar year (each, a \u201cMinimum Hedging Requirement Date\u201d) and (ii) at least 50% of our reasonably projected production of crude oil from our PDP reserves, for each full calendar month during the period from and including the 25th full calendar month following each such Minimum Hedging Requirement Date through and including the 36th full calendar month following each such Minimum Hedging Requirement Date; provided, that in the case of each of the above clauses (i) and (ii), the notional volumes hedged are deemed reduced by the notional volumes of any short puts or other similar derivatives having the effect of exposing us to commodity price risk below the \u201cfloor\u201d. In addition to minimum hedging requirements and other restrictions in respect of hedging described therein, the 2021 RBL Facility contains restrictions on our commodity hedging which prevent us from entering into hedging agreements (i) with a tenor exceeding 48 months or (ii) for notional volumes which (when aggregated with other hedges then in effect other than basis differential swaps on volumes already hedged) exceed, as of the date such hedging agreement is executed, 90% of our reasonably projected production of crude oil from our PDP reserves, for each month following the date such hedging agreement is entered into, provided that the volume limitations above do not apply to short puts or put options contracts that are not related to corresponding calls, collars, or swaps.\nOur commodity price risk management activities as well as the hedging requirements of the 2021 RBL facility may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases. Additionally, our hedges are based on major oil and gas indexes, which may not fully reflect the prices we realize locally. Consequently, the price protection we receive may not fully offset local price declines.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have hedged gas purchases at the following approximate volumes and prices: 34.9 mmbtu/d at $3.29 per mmbtu in 2022.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur commodity price risk management activities may also expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022the counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; and\n\u2022an event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices in the opposite direction of our derivative positions.\nOur existing debt agreements have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in certain activities. In addition, the borrowing base under the RBL Facility is subject to periodic redeterminations and our lenders could reduce capital available to us for investment.\nThe RBL Facility and the indenture governing our 2026 Notes have restrictive covenants that could limit our growth, financial flexibility and our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.These agreements contain covenants, that, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain types of preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022transfer, sell or dispose of assets;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022create certain liens securing indebtedness;\n\u2022enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022hedge future production or interest rates;\n\u2022repay or prepay certain indebtedness prior to the due date;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.\nIn addition, the RBL Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios, which may limit our ability to borrow funds to withstand a future downturn in our business, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of these limitations.\nIn addition, the 2021 RBL Facility has hedging requirements which may limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge or expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nThe amount available to be borrowed under the RBL Facility is subject to a borrowing base and will be redetermined semiannually and will depend on the estimated volumes and cash flows of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and other information deemed relevant by the administrative agent of, or two-thirds of the lenders under, the RBL Facility.We, the administrative agent and lenders, each may request one additional redetermination\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nbetween each regularly scheduled redetermination. Furthermore, our borrowing base is subject to automatic reductions due to certain asset sales and hedge terminations, the incurrence of certain other debt and other events as provided in the RBL Facility. For example, the RBL Facility currently provides that to the extent we incur certain unsecured indebtedness, our borrowing base will be reduced by an amount equal to 25% of the amount of such unsecured debt that exceeds the amount, if any, of certain other debt that is being refinanced by such unsecured debt. Reduction of our borrowing base under the RBL Facility could reduce the capital available to us for investment in our business. Additionally, we could be required to repay a portion of the RBL Facility to the extent that after a redetermination our outstanding borrowings at such time exceed the redetermined borrowing base. For additional details regarding the terms of the RBL Facility and our 2026 Notes, see \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt arrangements, which may not be successful.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $400 million outstanding on our 2026 Notes and no outstanding borrowings under our 2021 RBL Facility, with approximately $193 million of available borrowings capacity. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the RBL Facility and our 2026 Notes, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors that may be beyond our control. If oil and natural gas prices remain at low levels for an extended period of time or further deteriorate, our cash flows from operating activities may be insufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. The RBL Facility and our 2026 Notes currently restrict our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nDeclines in commodity prices, changes in expected capital development, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance may result in write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets.\nWe evaluate the impairment of our oil and natural gas properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. A write down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. For example, in the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax asset impairment charge of $289 million on proved properties in Utah and certain California locations.\nChanges in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under the RBL Facility may bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR, depending on our selection of repayment options. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the RBL Facility and may not be able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. The overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR.\nWe have significant concentrations of credit risk with our customers and the inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations or the loss of any one of our major oil and natural gas purchasers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant concentrations of credit risk with the purchasers of our oil and natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2021, sales to Tesoro Refining and Marketing, PBF Holding, Kern Oil & Refining, and Phillips 66accounted for approximately 30%, 16%, 14%, and 12% respectively, of our sales. This concentration may impact our overall credit risk because our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions or commodity price fluctuations. We do not require our customers to post collateral. If the purchasers of our oil and\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nnatural gas become insolvent, we may be unable to collect amounts owed to us. Also, if we were to lose any one of our major customers, the loss could cause us to cease or delay both production and sale of our oil and natural gas in the area supplying that customer.\nDue to the terms of supply agreements with our customers, we may not know that a customer is unable to make payment to us until almost two months after production has been delivered. We do not require our customers to post collateral to protect our ability to be paid.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nOur business is highly regulated and governmental authorities can delay or deny permits and approvals or change the requirements governing our operations, including the permitting approval process for oil and gas exploration, extraction, operations and production activities; well stimulation and other enhanced production techniques; and fluid injection or disposal activities, any of which could increase costs, restrict operations and delay our implementation of, or cause us to change, our business strategy and plans.\nLike other companies in the oil and gas industry, our operations are subject to a wide range of complex and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations. Federal, state and local agencies may assert overlapping authority to regulate in these areas. See \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Regulation of Health, Safety and Environmental Matters\u201d for a description of laws and regulations that affect our business. Collectively, the effect of the existing laws and regulations is to potentially limit the number and location of our wells through restrictions on the use of our properties, limit our ability to develop certain assets and conduct certain operations, and reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells below levels that would otherwise be possible. To operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state and local government authorities for a variety of activities including siting, drilling, completion, fluid injection and disposal, stimulation, operation, maintenance, transportation, marketing, site remediation, decommissioning, abandonment and water recycling and reuse. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which could in certain cases delay or halt projects, production of wells and other operations. Additionally, the regulatory burden on the industry increases our costs and consequently may have an adverse effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Failure to comply may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and liability for noncompliance, costs of corrective action, cleanup or restoration, compensation for personal injury, property damage or other losses, and the imposition of injunctive or declaratory relief restricting or limiting our operations.\nCalifornia, where most of our assets are located, is one of the most heavily regulated states in the United States with respect to oil and gas operations and our operations are subject to numerous and stringent state, local and other laws and regulations that could delay or otherwise adversely impact our operations. The jurisdiction, duties and enforcement authority of various state agencies have significantly increased with respect to oil and natural gas activities in recent years, and these state agencies as well as certain cities and counties have significantly revised their regulations, regulatory interpretations and data collection and reporting requirements and have indicated plans to issue additional regulations of certain oil and natural gas activities in 2022. Moreover, certain of these laws and regulations may apply retroactively and may impose strict or joint and several liability on us for events or conditions over which we and our predecessors had no control, without regard to fault, legality of the original activities, or ownership or control by third parties. Violations and liabilities with respect to these laws and regulations could result in significant administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages, permit modifications or revocations, operational interruptions or shutdowns and other liabilities. The costs of remedying such conditions may be significant, and remediation obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn California, We are also increasingly impacted by policies designed to curtail the production and use of fossil fuels. For example, in September 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom of California issued an executive order that seeks to reduce both the supply of and demand for fossil fuels in the state. The executive order established several goals and directed several state agencies to take certain actions with respect to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to: phasing out the sale of emissions-producing vehicles; developing strategies for the\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nclosure and repurposing of oil and gas facilities in California; and calling on the California State Legislature to enact new laws prohibiting hydraulic fracturing in the state by 2024. The executive order also directed CalGEM to finish its review of public health and safety concerns from the impacts of oil extraction activities and propose significantly strengthened regulations. At this time, we cannot predict how implementation of these actions and proposals may impact our operations. For additional information, see \u201cItems 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Regulation of Health, Safety and Environmental Matters\u201d and \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Operations and Industry-There are significant uncertainties with respect to obtaining permits for oil and gas activities in Kern County, where all of our California operations are located, which could adversely and materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and Prospects\" and \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Operations and Industry-Attempts by the California state government to restrict the production of oil and gas could negatively impact our operations and result in decreased demand for fossil fuels within the states where we operate.\"\nOur operations may also be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities imposed under the Endangered Species Act or similar state laws designed to protect various wildlife, such as the Greater Sage Grouse. Such restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species or their habitat could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures.\nOur customers, including refineries and utilities, and the businesses that transport our products to customers are also highly regulated. For example, federal and state agencies have subjected or, proposed subjecting, more gas and liquid gathering lines, pipelines and storage facilities to regulations that have increased business costs and otherwise affect the demand, volatility and other aspects of the price we pay for fuel gas. Certain municipalities have enacted restrictions on the installation of natural gas appliances and infrastructure in new residential or commercial construction, which could affect the retail natural gas market for our utility customers and the demand and prices we receive for the natural gas we produce.\nCosts of compliance may increase, and operational delays or restrictions may occur as existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or as new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations, each of which has occurred in the past. For example, our costs have recently begun to increase due to new fluid injection regulations, data requirements for permitting, and idle well decommissioning regulations. For instance, in 2021 we paid $19 million in asset retirement obligations, an increase from $18 million in 2020, largely due to the new idle well regulations and EH&S focused costs and initiatives associated with developing existing fields. In addition, we may experience delays, as we have in the past, due to insufficient internal processes and personnel resource constraints at regulatory agencies that impede their ability to process permits in a timely manner that aligns with our production projects.\nGovernment authorities and other organizations continue to study health, safety and environmental aspects of oil and natural gas operations, including those related to air, soil and water quality, ground movement or seismicity and natural resources. Government authorities have also adopted, proposed, or otherwise considering new or more stringent requirements for permitting, well construction and public disclosure or environmental review of, or restrictions on, oil and natural gas operations. For example, there has been increased scrutiny with respect to hydraulic fracturing over the years by various state and federal agencies, which scrutiny has extended to oil and gas exploration and production activities more generally. This has resulted in more stringent regulation with respect to air emissions from oil and gas operations, restrictions on water discharges and calls to remove exemptions for certain oil and gas wastes from federal hazardous waste laws and regulations, amongst other restrictions. Separately, as another example, the scope of the federal Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d) has been subject to substantial uncertainty in recent years, which has the potential to increase permitting burdens. In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cCorps\u201d) issued a rule expanding the scope of the term \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d (\u201cWOTUS\u201d) to include certain areas not traditionally considered to be subject to federal jurisdiction (the \u201cClean Water Rule\u201d). Subsequently, in January 2020, the EPA and the Corps finalized the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which narrowed the definition of jurisdictional WOTUS relative to the Clean Water Rule. Both of these rulemakings have been subject to legal challenge, and the Biden Administration has announced plans to establish its own definition of\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nWOTUS. Most recently, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rulemaking to revoke the 2020 rule in favor of a pre-2015 definition until a new definition is proposed which the Biden Administration has announced is underway. Additionally, in January 2022, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case on the scope and authority of the Clean Water Act and the definition of WOTUS. As a result of these developments, the scope of the CWA is uncertain at this time. To the extent any rule expands the range of properties subject to the CWA\u2019s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining dredge and fill activity permits in wetland areas, which could materially impact our operations in the San Joaquin basin and other areas. Such requirements or associated litigation could result in potentially significant added costs to comply, delay or curtail our exploration, development, fluid injection and disposal or production activities, and preclude us from drilling, completing or stimulating wells, which could have an adverse effect on our expected production, other operations and financial condition.\nChanges to elected or appointed officials or their priorities and policies could result in different approaches to the regulation of the oil and natural gas industry. We cannot predict the actions the California governor or legislature may take with respect to the regulation of our business, the oil and natural gas industry or the state's economic, fiscal or environmental policies, nor can we predict what actions may be taken in states or at the federal level with respect to environmental laws and policies, including those that may directly or indirectly impact our operations.\nPotential future legislation may generally affect the taxation of natural gas and oil exploration and development companies and may adversely affect our operations and cash flows.\nIn past years, federal and state level legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal and state income tax provisions currently available to natural gas and oil exploration and development companies. For example, the Biden administration has set forth several tax proposals that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws. Such proposals include, but are not limited to, (i) an increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations and (ii) the elimination of tax subsidies, generally in the form of accelerated deductions, for fossil fuels. Congress could consider some or all of these proposals in connection with tax reform to be undertaken by the Biden administration. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals and other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could adversely affect our operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, in California, there have been proposals for new taxes on profits that might have a negative impact on us. Although the proposals have not become law, campaigns by various special interest groups could lead to future additional oil and natural gas severance or other taxes. The imposition of such taxes could significantly reduce our profit margins and cash flow and otherwise significantly increase our costs.\nDerivatives legislation and regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives market and entities, like us, that participate in that market. Rules and regulations applicable to OTC derivatives transactions, and these rules may affect both the size of positions that we may hold and the ability or willingness of counterparties to trade opposite us, potentially increasing costs for transactions. Moreover, such changes could materially reduce our hedging opportunities which could adversely affect our revenues and cash flow during periods of low commodity prices. While many Dodd-Frank Act regulations are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is ongoing, and the ultimate effect of the adopted rules and regulations and any future rules and regulations on our business remains uncertain.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to, or otherwise be affected by, such regulations. Even though certain of the European Union implementing regulations have become effective, the ultimate effect on our business of the European Union implementing regulations (including future implementing rules and regulations) remains uncertain.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nOur operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which we may conduct oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, and reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, with the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, and together with the DOT, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. The regulation of methane from oil and gas facilities has been subject to uncertainty in recent years. In September 2020, the Trump Administration revised prior regulations to rescind certain methane standards and remove the transmission and storage segments from the source category for certain regulations. However, subsequently, the U.S. Congress approved, and President Biden signed into a law, a resolution to repeal the September 2020 revisions to the methane standards, effectively reinstating the prior standards. In response to President Biden\u2019s executive order, in November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish new source and first-time existing source standards of performance for methane and volatile organic compound emissions for oil and gas facilities. Operators of affected facilities will have to comply with specific standards of performance to include leak detection using optical gas imaging and subsequent repair requirement, and reduction of emissions by 95% through capture and control systems. The EPA plans to issue a supplemental proposal in 2022 containing additional requirements not included in the November 2021 proposed rule and anticipates the issuance of a final rule by the end of the year. We cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements. However, given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a significant possibility.\nAdditionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of GHG emissions, such as methane. For example, California, through the CARB has implemented a cap and trade program for GHG emissions that sets a statewide maximum limit on covered GHG emissions, and this cap declines annually to reach 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Covered entities must either reduce their GHG emissions or purchase allowances to account for such emissions. Separately, California has implemented LCFS and associated tradable credits that require a progressively lower carbon intensity of the state's fuel supply than baseline gasoline and diesel fuels. CARB has also promulgated regulations regarding monitoring, leak detection, repair and reporting of methane emissions from both existing and new oil and gas production facilities.\nIn September 2018, California adopted a law committing California , the fifth largest economy in the world, to the use of 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2045, and the Governor of California also signed an executive order committing California to total economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045. In furtherance of these goals, Governor Newsom issued an order to CalGEM in April 2021, directing the agency to initiate regulatory action to end the issuance of new permits for hydraulic fracturing by January 2024. Additionally, Governor Newsom requested that the CARB analyze pathways to phase out oil extraction across the state by no later than 2045. We cannot predict how these various laws, regulations and orders may ultimately affect our operations. However, these initiatives could result in decreased demand for the oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we produce, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our operations altogether in California, and therefore adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nAt the international level, the United Nations-sponsored \u201cParis Agreement\u201d requires member states to individually determine and submit non-binding emissions reduction targets every five years after 2020. Although the United States had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, following an executive order signed by President Biden on his first day in office, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement in February 2021. In April 2021, the United States established a goal of reducing economy-wide net GHG emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Additionally, at the 26th Conference of the Parties (\u201cCOP26\u201d) in Glasgow in November 2021, the United States and the European Union jointly announced the launch of the Global Methane Pledge, an initiative committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030, including \u201call feasible reductions\u2019 in the energy sector. The full impact of these actions is uncertain at this time and it is unclear what additional initiatives may be adopted or implemented that may have adverse effects upon our operations.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate change related pledges made by certain candidates for public office. These have included promises to pursue actions to limit emissions and curtail the production of oil and gas, such as through banning new leases for production of minerals on federal properties. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order calling for increased regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector; for more information, see our regulatory disclosure titled \u201cAir Emissions\u201d. Subsequently, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that calls for substantial action on climate change, including, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and increased emphasis on climate-related risk across agencies and economic sectors. The Biden Administration has also called for restrictions on leasing on federal land, including the Department of Interior\u2019s publication of a report in November 2021 recommending various changes to the federal leasing program, though any such changes would require Congressional action; for more information, see our regulatory disclosure titled \u201cHydraulic Stimulation\u201d. Our operations involve the use of hydraulic fracturing activities and we also have operations on federal lands under the jurisdiction of the BLM within the DOI. Other actions that could be pursued by President Biden may include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as other GHG emissions limitations for oil and gas facilities.\nLitigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against oil and natural gas companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but withheld material information from their investors or customers by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. For example, at COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (\u201cGFANZ\u201d) announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over $130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. The various sub-alliances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing, and/or underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050. There is also a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. In late 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it had joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (\u201cNGFS\u201d), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. Subsequently, in November 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. Although we cannot predict the effects of these actions, such limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced its intention to promulgate rules requiring climate disclosures.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nAlthough the form and substance of these requirements is not yet known, this may result in additional costs to comply with any such disclosure requirements.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from oil and natural gas producers such as ourselves or otherwise restrict the areas in which we may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for or erode value for, the oil and natural gas that we produce. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks may result in our restricting or canceling oil and natural gas production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing our ability to continue to operate in an economic manner. Moreover, there are increasing risks to operations resulting from the potential physical impacts of climate change, such as drought, wildfires, damage to infrastructure and resources from flooding and other natural disasters and other physical disruptions. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nA large portion of our common stock is beneficially owned by a relatively small number of stockholders. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures, hostile takeovers or other transactions, including the payment of dividends or the issuance of additional equity or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or in another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholder concentrations.\nOur significant stockholders and their affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation could enable our significant stockholders to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nOur governing documents provide that our stockholders and their affiliates are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, among other things:\n\u2022permits stockholders to make investments in competing businesses; and\n\u2022provides that if one of our directors who is also an employee, officer or director of a stockholder (a \u201cDual Role Person\u201d), becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us.\nOur director who is a Dual Role Person may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which our stockholders have invested, in which case we may not become aware of, or otherwise have the ability to pursue, such opportunity. Further, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to be unavailable to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nCertain of our largest stockholders were creditors of Berry LLC prior to the Chapter 11 Proceedings and we cannot predict when or whether they will sell their shares of common stock. Future sales, or concerns about them, may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nWe may sell or otherwise issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides for authorized capital stock consisting of 750,000,000 shares of common stock and 250,000,000 shares of preferred stock. In addition, we registered shares of the great majority of our common stock for resale. For more information see Exhibit 4.4 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe issuance of any securities for acquisitions, financing, upon conversion or exercise of convertible securities, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of our outstanding common stock. If we issue any such additional securities, the issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders. We cannot predict the size of any future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nShares of our common stock are also reserved for issuance as equity-based awards to employees, directors and certain other persons under the second amended and restated 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (our \u201cOmnibus Plan\u201d). We have filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of shares of our common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our Omnibus Plan. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, the expiration of certain lock-up agreements and the requirements of Rule 144, shares registered under the registration statement on Form S-8 may be made available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction. Investors may experience dilution in the value of their investment upon the exercise of any equity awards that may be granted or issued pursuant to the Omnibus Plan in the future.\nThe payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors.\nWe temporarily discontinued our quarterly dividends in the second quarter 2020 following the historic oil price drop and economic impact of COVID-19. We reinstated a quarterly dividend at a reduced rate beginning the first quarter of 2021 and then increased the rate 50% beginning with the third quarter of 2021. The Company's Board of Directors declared a regular dividend of $0.06 per share on the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock, payable on April 15, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2022. In addition, the Board implemented a shareholder return strategy that contemplates additional dividends to shareholders from discretionary cash flow, but there is no certainty that we will generate discretionary cash flow, nor is the Board obligated to make any dividends and any dividends are subject to the restrictions in our debt documents as described below. The payment and amount of future dividend payments, if any, are subject to declaration by our Board. Such payments will depend on various factors, including actual results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, net cash provided by operating activities, restrictions imposed by applicable law, our taxable income, our operating expenses and other factors our Board deems relevant. Additionally, covenants contained in our RBL Facility and the indentures governing our 2026 Notes could limit the payment of dividends. We are under no obligation to make dividend payments on our common stock and cannot be certain when such payments may resume in the future.\nWe may issue preferred stock, the terms of which could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and are able to take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, including auditor attestation requirements or any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) as of the end of the fiscal year that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nWe intend to take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards which lasts until those standards apply to private companies or we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. Our election to use the phase-in periods permitted by this election may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those companies who will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable.\nTo the extent investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reduced reporting and exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur internal control over financial reporting is not currently required to meet all of the standards required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to provide annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d which could be up to five years from our IPO.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, safeguard our assets, and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, safeguard our assets or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nWe may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of effective internal controls. Further, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price and could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nIndex to Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For more information see Exhibit 4.4 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor example, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that (i) authorize our Board to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval and (ii) establish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions could enable the Board to delay or prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may discourage or prevent attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may also discourage or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 17956, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "BRY"}
