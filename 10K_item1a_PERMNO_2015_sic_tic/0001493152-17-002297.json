RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Report and in other documents that we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Report. You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Report could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY AND STRATEGY\nEconomic downturns and the volatility and level of oil and natural gas prices could have a negative impact on our businesses. Demand for the services offered by us has been and is expected to continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including demand for engineering services in the petroleum refining, petroleum chemical and pipeline industries and in other industries that we provide services to. During economic downturns in these industries, our customers\u2019 need to engage us may decline significantly and projects may be delayed or cancelled. We cannot predict how long the current economic downturn will last or how long the price of oil will remain relatively low. However, these factors can cause our profitability to decline significantly.\nIn addition, demand for our services in the upstream oil and gas industry fluctuates and relies on our clients\u2019 willingness to make future expenditures to explore for, develop, produce and transport oil and natural gas in the United States. For example, during 2016, our revenues were negatively impacted by the sustained reduction in oil and gas prices and the resulting drop in our clients\u2019 activities in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the energy industry. Our clients\u2019 willingness to undertake these activities depends largely on the following factors:\n\u25cf Prices and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf Domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf The cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf Weather conditions, such as hurricanes, which may affect our clients\u2019 ability to produce oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf Available pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u25cf Federal, state and local regulation of oilfield activities;\n\u25cf Environmental concerns regarding the methods our customers use to produce oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf The availability of water resources and the cost of disposal and recycling services; and\n\u25cf Seasonal limitations on access to work locations.\nAnticipated future prices for oil and natural gas are a primary factor affecting spending by our clients. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and lower prices or volatility in prices for oil and natural gas typically decreases spending by our clients, which can cause rapid and material declines in demand for our services and in the prices we are able to charge for our services. Further, a sustained period of lower prices and volatility in prices for oil and natural gas can exacerbate the potential for cancellations and adjustments to our backlog from our clients in the oil and natural gas industry.\nOur future revenue depends on our ability to consistently bid and win new contracts, provide high quality, cost-effective services, and to maintain and renew existing contracts. Our failure to effectively obtain future contracts could adversely affect our profitability. Our future revenue and overall results of operations require us to successfully bid on new contracts, provide high quality, cost-effective services, and renew existing contracts. Contract proposals and negotiations are complex and frequently involve a lengthy bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, financing arrangements and required governmental approvals. For example, a client may require us to provide a bond or letter of credit to protect the client should we fail to perform under the terms of the contract. When negative market conditions arise, or if we fail to secure adequate financial arrangements or required governmental approvals, we may not be able to pursue particular projects, which could adversely affect our profitability. These factors have impacted our operations in the past several years and may continue to do so.\nOur business and operating results could be adversely affected by our inability to accurately estimate the overall risks, revenue or costs on a contract. Revenue recognition for a contract requires judgment relative to assessing the contracts estimated risks, revenue and costs and technical issues. Due to the size, complexity and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of overall risk, revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates have in the past and may continue to adversely affect future period financial performance.\nWe may incur significant costs in providing services in excess of original project scope without having an approved change order. After commencement of a contract, we may perform, without the benefit of an approved change order from the customer, additional services requested by the customer that were not contemplated in our contract price due to customer changes or to incomplete or inaccurate engineering, project specifications, and other similar information provided to us by the customer. Our construction contracts generally require the customer to compensate us for additional work or expenses incurred under these circumstances as long as we obtain prior written approval. A failure to obtain adequate written approvals prior to performing the work could require us to record an adjustment to revenue and profit recognized in prior periods under the percentage-of-completion accounting method. Any such adjustments, if substantial, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly for the period in which such adjustments are made. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or otherwise, approved change orders in an amount sufficient to compensate us for our additional, unapproved work or expenses.\nOur expansion into the modular solutions market could subject us to increased costs and risks related and may not achieve the intended results. Expanding our business activities into the modular solutions market could subject us to unexpected costs and risks. Such activities could subject us to increased operating costs, product liability, regulatory requirements and reputational risks. Our expansion into new and existing markets may present competitive and distribution challenges that differ from current ones. We may be less familiar with the target customers and may face different or additional risks, as well as increased or unexpected costs, compared to existing operations. Growth into new markets may also bring us into direct competition with companies with whom we have little or no past experience as competitors. To the extent we are reliant upon expansion into new product markets for growth and do not meet the new challenges posed by such expansion, our future sales growth could be negatively impacted, our operating costs could increase, and our business operations and financial results could be negatively affected. Expanding into the modular solutions market has required additional investments, and if not successful, we may not realize the return on our investments as anticipated or our operating results could be adversely affected by slower than expected sales growth or additional costs.\nThe failure to attract and retain key professional personnel could materially adversely affect our business. Our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel even in an environment where the contracting process is more difficult. We are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, technical and business development personnel. In particular, competition for key management personnel continues to be intense. We cannot be certain that we will retain our key managerial, technical and business development personnel or be able to attract or assimilate key personnel in the future. Failure to attract and retain such personnel would materially adversely affect our businesses, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently cannot borrow under our credit facility which may limit our ability to finance operations or engage in other business activities which could have a material impact on our financial condition. Our current credit facility consists of a revolving loan facility of up to the lesser of $10.0 million or the Borrowing Base (as defined in the Loan Agreement) in addition to a sub-facility for standby and / or trade letters of credit up to $2.5 million and restricts us from mergers, acquisitions, sales of assets, and paying dividends, among other provisions which could restrict opportunities for growth. However, we currently cannot borrow under our credit facility due to an existing event of default resulting from our failure to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant. While there are no revolving loans currently outstanding under the Loan Agreement, during February 2017, a letter of credit in the amount of $682,000 and with a termination date of December 31, 2017 was issued under this facility that we collateralized with cash. While we are currently negotiating with the lender to address the outstanding event of default and our ability to borrow under the facility in the future, we cannot assure you that we will reach an agreement with the lender. If we are unable to address the outstanding event of default, we or the Lender may terminate the Loan Agreement and the lender may accelerate any outstanding loan amounts. While we believe our current cash on hand, internally generated funds and other working capital are sufficient to fund our current operations, not having access to this or a replacement credit facility may limit our ability to finance operations or engage in other business activities, which could have a material impact on our financial condition.\nOur dependence on one or a few customers could adversely affect us. One or a few clients have in the past and may in the future contribute a significant portion of our consolidated revenue in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. In 2016, our top three clients accounted for 15.4%, 14.0% and 9.2% of our revenue, respectively, and our ten largest customers accounted for 73.4% of our revenue. As our backlog frequently reflects multiple projects for individual clients, one major customer may comprise a significant percentage of our backlog at any point in time. Because these significant customers generally contract with us for specific projects, we may lose them in other years as their projects with us are completed. If we do not continually replace them with other customers or other projects, our business could be materially adversely affected. Also, the majority of our contracts can be terminated at will. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant customers, our contracts with these customers are on a project-by-project basis and the customers may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their purchases at any time. In addition, dissatisfaction with the results of a single project could have a much more widespread impact on our ability to get additional projects from a single major client. The loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nInternal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our clients, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenue, profitability and operating results. Our information technology systems are subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, intruders or hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks. Any such failures could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. Failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Any system or service disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our business including, among other things, an adverse effect on our ability to bill our clients for work performed on our contracts, collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We have invested and will continue to pursue further investments in systems that will allow us to achieve and remain in compliance with the regulations governing our business; however, there can be no assurance that such systems will be effective at achieving and maintaining compliance or that we will not incur additional costs in order to make such systems effective.\nIf we are unable to collect our receivables, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed and materials supplied. In the ordinary course of business, we extend unsecured credit to our customers. We may also agree to allow our customers to defer payment on projects until certain milestones have been met or until the projects are substantially completed, and customers typically withhold some portion of amounts due to us as retainage. For example, as of December 31, 2016, our customer for the CPC Project had $1.4 million in retainage. We bear the risk that our clients will pay us late or not at all. Though we evaluate and attempt to monitor our clients\u2019 financial condition, there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess their creditworthiness. To the extent the credit quality of our clients deteriorates or our clients seek bankruptcy protection, our ability to collect receivables and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Even if our clients are credit-worthy, they may delay payments in an effort to manage their cash flow. Financial difficulties or business failure experienced by one or more of our major customers has had and could, in the future, continue to have a material adverse effect on both our ability to collect receivables and our results of operations.\nOur backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future revenue or earnings. As of December 31, 2016, our backlog was approximately $37 million, including $8 million for the CPC Project. We expect a majority of this backlog to be completed in 2017. We cannot assure investors that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. Projects currently in our backlog may be canceled or may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time prior to project execution and, once project execution begins, it may occur unevenly over the current and multiple future periods. In addition, project terminations, suspensions or reductions in scope occur from time to time with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog, reducing the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts reflected in our backlog. Future project cancellations and scope adjustments could further reduce the dollar amount of our backlog in addition to the revenue and profits that we actually earn. The potential for cancellations and adjustments to our backlog are exacerbated by economic conditions, particularly in our chosen area of concentration, the energy industry. The energy industry has experienced a sustained period of low crude oil and natural gas prices which has reduced our clients\u2019 activities in the energy industry.\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from U.S. federal, state and local government agencies, and as a result, any disruption in government funding, any change in our ability to comply with various procurement laws and regulations as a U.S. Government contractor, or any exercise by the U.S. Government of certain rights to modify, delay, curtail, renegotiate, or terminate existing contracts for convenience could adversely affect our business. In 2016, we generated approximately 15.4% of our revenue from contracts with U.S. federal, state and local government agencies. A significant amount of this revenue is derived under multi-year contracts, many of which are appropriated on an annual basis. As a result, at the beginning of a project, the related contract may be only partially funded, and additional funding is normally committed only as appropriations are made in each subsequent year. Our backlog includes only the portion of the contract award for which funding has been appropriated. Whether appropriations are made, and the timing of payment of appropriated amounts, may be influenced by numerous factors that could affect our U.S. Government contracting business, including the following:\n\u25cf The failure of the U.S. Government to complete its budget and appropriations process before its fiscal year-end, which may result in U.S. Government agencies delaying the procurement of services;\n\u25cf Budget constraints or policy changes resulting in delay or curtailment of expenditures related to the services we provide;\n\u25cf The timing and amount of tax revenue received by federal, and state and local governments, and the overall level of government expenditures;\n\u25cf Delays associated with insufficient numbers of government staff to oversee contracts;\n\u25cf Competing political priorities and changes in the political climate with regard to the funding or operation of the services we provide;\n\u25cf Unsatisfactory performance on government contracts by us or one of our subcontractors, negative government audits or other events that may impair our relationship with federal, state or local governments;\n\u25cf A dispute with or improper activity by any of our subcontractors; and\n\u25cf General economic or political conditions.\nIn addition, we must comply with and are affected by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we do business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. Although we take precautions to prevent and deter fraud, misconduct, and non-compliance, we face the risk that our employees or outside partners may engage in misconduct, fraud, or other improper activities. U.S. government agencies, such as the DCAA, routinely audit and investigate government contractors and evaluate compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. In addition, during the course of its audits, the DCAA may question our incurred project costs. If the DCAA believes we have accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of applicable laws, regulations and standards, the DCAA auditor may recommend that such costs be disallowed. Historically, we have not experienced significant disallowed costs as a result of government audits. However, we can provide no assurance that the DCAA or other government audits will not result in material disallowances for incurred costs in the future.\nAlso, U.S. Government projects in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor may extend for several years. Generally, government contracts include the right to modify, delay, curtail, renegotiate, or terminate contracts and subcontracts at the government\u2019s convenience any time prior to their completion. Any decision by a U.S. Government client to modify, delay, curtail, renegotiate, or terminate our contracts at their convenience may result in a decline in our profits and revenue.\nThe CPC Project, which represents a significant portion of our current business, involves a pipeline expansion project in Russia and Kazakhstan along the Caspian Sea, and we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks in that geographic region that are greater than in the United States. The CPC Project is engineering, procurement, and commissioning services agreement with the Caspian Pipeline Consortium that is expected to have a total value of approximately $89 million over the life of the contract and represents approximately $8 million of our backlog at December 31, 2016. This contract involves a pipeline expansion project in Russia and Kazakhstan along the Caspian Sea. This region, specifically Russia, has undergone significant political, economic and social change in recent years, and the risk of unforeseen changes in this region may be greater than in the United States. For example, Russia and the Ukraine are experiencing significant unrest, which has involved, among other things, Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean region of Ukraine in 2014. As a result, economic sanctions by the U.S., United Nations and other countries remain in place against Russia, and additional sanctions are possible as the situation continues into 2017. In addition, changes in laws or regulations, including with respect to payment of service providers, taxation, transportation, information technology, data transmission and the Internet, or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, whether caused by a change in government or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our ability to perform under the CPC Project and, thus, our business, operating results and financial condition. While we do not believe that the possibility of a continued armed conflict with respect to Russia and Ukraine will affect the region in which we perform services under the CPC Project, conducting and expanding our international operations through the CPC Project subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the United States. These include:\n\u25cf Difficulties in managing the staffing of our international operations, including hiring and retaining qualified employees and transportation of employees to and from the region;\n\u25cf Difficulties and increased expense introducing corporate policies and controls in our international operations;\n\u25cf Increased expense to comply with foreign laws and legal standards, including laws that regulate pricing and promotion activities and the import and export of information technology, which can be difficult to monitor and are often subject to change;\n\u25cf Increased expense to comply with U.S. laws that apply to foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations;\n\u25cf Longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf Political, social and economic instability; and\n\u25cf Expropriation of assets by foreign governments.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our operations under the CPC Project and, consequently, our operating results. Further, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that the resources required to perform our services under the CPC Project in these other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nLiability claims could result in losses. Providing engineering and design services involves the risk of contract, professional errors and omissions and other liability claims, as well as adverse publicity. Further, many of our contracts require us to indemnify our clients not only for our negligence, if any, but also for the concurrent negligence of our clients. We currently maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for professional errors and omissions. However, claims outside of or exceeding our insurance coverage may be made. A significant claim could result in unexpected liabilities, take management time away from operations, and have a material adverse impact on our cash flow.\nUnsatisfactory safety performance can affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs and result in high employee turnover. Our workers are subject to the normal hazards associated with providing services on construction sites and industrial facilities. Even with proper safety precautions, these hazards can lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage to, or destruction of property, plant and equipment, and environmental damages. We are intensely focused on maintaining a safe environment and reducing the risk of accidents across all of our job sites. However, poor safety performance may limit or eliminate potential revenue streams from many of our largest customers and may materially increase our future insurance and other operating costs. In hiring new employees, we normally target experienced personnel; however, we also hire inexperienced employees. Even with thorough safety training, inexperienced employees have a higher likelihood of injury which could lead to higher operating costs and insurance rates.\nWe may consider growing through acquisitions and may not be successful in doing so or in integrating effectively any business or operations we may acquire. As part of our historic business strategy, we have expanded our business through strategic acquisitions. Appropriate acquisitions could allow us to expand into new geographical locations, offer new services, add complementary businesses to expand our portfolio of services, enhance our capital strength or acquire additional talent. Accordingly, our future performance will be impacted by our ability to identify appropriate businesses to acquire, negotiate favorable terms for such acquisitions and effectively and efficiently integrate such acquisitions into our existing businesses. There is no certainty that we will succeed in completing any future acquisitions or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired businesses or to operate them profitably.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u25cf Difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products, existing contracts, accounting and personnel of the target company and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses;\n\u25cf Difficulties in supporting and transitioning customers, if any, of the target company;\n\u25cf Diversion of our financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u25cf The price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity;\n\u25cf Risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u25cf Potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from either our current business or the target company\u2019s business;\n\u25cf Assumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities, such as problems with the quality of the target company\u2019s services;\n\u25cf Risks associated with possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws as a result of any acquisition or otherwise applicable to our business; and\n\u25cf Inability to generate sufficient net income to justify the acquisition costs.\nAcquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairment in the future that could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted, which could lower the market price of our common stock. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of amounts that we anticipate.\nOur dependence on third party subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could adversely affect us. We rely on third party subcontractors as well as third party suppliers and manufacturers to complete our projects. To the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire supplies or materials, our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion may be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed-price or time-and-material contracts, we could experience losses on these contracts. In addition, if a subcontractor or supplier is unable to deliver its services or materials according to the negotiated contract terms for any reason, including the deterioration of its financial condition or over-commitment of its resources, we may be required to purchase the services or materials from another source at a higher price. This may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services or materials were needed.\nForce majeure events such as natural disasters could negatively impact the economy and the industries we service, which may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Force majeure events, such as hurricanes, could negatively impact the economies of the areas in which we operate. For example, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike caused considerable damage along the Gulf Coast not only to the refining and petrochemical industry, but also the commercial segment which competes for labor, materials and equipment resources needed throughout the entire United States. In some cases, we remain obligated to perform our services after a natural disaster even though our contracts may contain force majeure clauses. In those cases, if we are not able to react quickly and/or negotiate contractual relief on favorable terms to us, our operations may be significantly and adversely affected, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING\nOur stock price could be volatile, which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment. The stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In particular, the market price of our common stock, like that of the securities of other energy companies, has been and may continue to be highly volatile. During 2016, the sales price of our stock ranged from a low of $0.68 per share in January 2016, to a high of $2.72 per share in December 2016. Factors such as announcements concerning our financial and operating results, the availability of capital, and economic and other external factors, as well as period-to-period fluctuations and financial results, may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock. From time to time, there has been limited trading volume in our common stock. In addition, there can be no assurance that there will continue to be a trading market or that any securities research analysts will continue to provide research coverage with respect to our common stock. It is possible that such factors will adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nOur stock repurchase program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and will diminish our cash reserves. In April 2015, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 million of our common stock from time to time through open market or privately negotiated transactions, based on prevailing market conditions. We are not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount or specific number of shares of common stock under the repurchase program, which may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect the trading price of our common stock and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause the trading price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Additionally, repurchases under our stock repurchase program will diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances.\nA small number of stockholders own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, thus limiting the extent to which other stockholders can effect decisions subject to stockholder vote. Directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of ENGlobal and their affiliates, beneficially own approximately 57% of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of this Report. Accordingly, these stockholders, as a group, are able to affect the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the adoption or amendment of provisions in our Articles of Incorporation or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions.\nThe existence of these levels of ownership concentrated in a few persons makes it unlikely that any other holder of common stock will be able to affect the management or direction of the Company. These factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in management or voting control of the Company.\nOur Board of Directors may authorize future sales of ENGlobal common stock, which could result in a decrease in the market value to existing stockholders of the shares they hold. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to an additional 47,809,918 shares of common stock and an additional 2,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock as of December 31, 2016. These shares may be issued without stockholder approval unless the issuance is 20% or more of our outstanding common stock, in which case the NASDAQ requires stockholder approval. We may issue shares of stock in the future in connection with acquisitions or financings. In addition, we may issue restricted stock or options under our 2009 Equity Incentive Plan. Future issuances of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the ability of the Board of Directors to issue additional stock may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control of the Company, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of our securities in connection with financing transactions or under equity incentive plans could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership. We may decide to raise additional funds to fund our operations through the issuance of public or private debt or equity securities. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future issuances of debt, our common stock, other equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock or other equity securities or the availability of any of the foregoing for future sale, will have on the market price of our common stock. The issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock (including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options or the conversion or exchange of any convertible or exchangeable securities outstanding now or in the future), or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. In addition, further dilution to our existing stockholders will result, and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 86122, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "ENG"}
