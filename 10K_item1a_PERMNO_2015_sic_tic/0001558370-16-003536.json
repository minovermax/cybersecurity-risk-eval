{"cik": "1208208", "company": "DIGITALGLOBE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nRisks\nOur business is subject to many risks. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe loss or reduction in scope of any one of our primary contracts will materially reduce our revenue. The majority of our revenue is currently derived from a single contract with a U.S. Government agency that can be terminated at any time.\nWe generated 63.7% of our revenue from the U.S. Government and 48.0% from the EnhancedView SLA in 2015. Our contracts with U.S. Government agencies are subject to risks of termination or reduction in scope due to changes in U.S. Government policies, priorities or funding level commitments to various agencies. Under the EnhancedView SLA, we are obligated to make a portion of the image tasking capacity of the WorldView constellation available to the NGA, including specified priority access rights. Beginning September 1, 2013, the NGA has the option to require us to lower the altitude of WorldView-2 from its current altitude of 770 kilometers to an altitude of 496 kilometers, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The lowering of the orbital altitude could result in a decrease in the amount of square kilometers collected by WorldView-2. While we believe the decrease in collection capability would be offset by improved data capture capabilities on the ground, there can be no assurance that our current collection capability will be maintained. Our ability to service other customers could be negatively impacted if we are unable to maintain our current collection capacity. In addition, any inability on our part to meet the performance requirements of the EnhancedView Contract could result in a breach of our contract with the NGA. A breach of our contract with the NGA or reduction in service to our other customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe NGA may also terminate or suspend our contracts, including the EnhancedView Contract, at any time with or without cause. If the EnhancedView Contract was terminated early, recognition of revenue currently classified as deferred would be accelerated. If the contract was extended, the time period over which certain deferred revenue balances are currently expected to be recognized could be extended, resulting in lower revenue recognition than currently anticipated. Additionally, any changes in the size, scope or term of the EnhancedView Contract could impact our satellite replenishment strategy and our ability to repay or refinance our long-term debt. Although our NGA contracts generally involve fixed annual minimum commitments, such commitments are subject to annual Congressional appropriations and the federal budget process, and as a result, the NGA may not continue to fund these contracts at current or anticipated levels. In addition, the sequestration process under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (PL 112-25) could have an adverse impact on the timing and amount of appropriations available for defense programs, including EnhancedView. Under the terms of the Budget Control Act, discretionary spending is capped, and any breach of the caps would result in automatic, across-the-board spending cuts, known as sequestration. The Budget Control Act assumed that spending cap recommendations would be recommended to Congress by the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. This Committee failed to come to agreement, and accordingly sequestration was implemented during 2014. Sequestration did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations during 2014. However, future reductions in the current EnhancedView program or other current or future business with the Department of Defense resulting from sequestration could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny program delays in required support of the EnhancedView Contract, may affect our ability to meet our obligations under the EnhancedView Contract resulting in a reduction of scope or termination of the contract, and may otherwise require us to increase our reliance on our existing satellites to meet our business needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacturing, testing, launching and operation of satellites involves complex processes and technology. We rely on third-party contractors for the manufacturing, testing, and launch of our satellites, as well as solutions for any anomalies encountered while in orbit. Many factors, including, but not limited to, availability of parts, subcontractor and supplier delays and anomalies discovered in orbit, may result in significant challenges to our business. For example, during orbit, satellites may experience technical difficulties communicating with the ground terminals or collecting imagery in the same quality or volume that was intended. The failure to mitigate any technical difficulties could affect our ability to meet our obligations under the EnhancedView Contract and may otherwise limit the anticipated volume of imagery products and services available to meet our business needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the EnhancedView Contract obligates us to meet certain capacity and timeliness of delivery requirements. To meet these requirements, we have expanded our network of ground terminals around the world. Our ground terminals are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and/or damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nInterruption or failure of our infrastructure could hurt our ability to effectively perform our daily operations and provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our satellite operations infrastructure, information technology and communications systems. Any downtime, damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service, which could reduce our revenue and profits. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems. We do not currently maintain a back-up production facility from which we can continue to collect, process and deliver imagery in the event of the loss of our primary facility. In the event we are unable to collect, process and deliver imagery from our facility in Longmont, Colorado, our daily operations and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our ground terminal centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and/or damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition that may cause us to have to reduce our prices or to lose market share.\nOur products and services compete with satellite and aerial imagery and related products and services offered by a range of private and government providers. Our current or future competitors may have disruptive technologies or greater financial, personnel and other resources than we have. The value of our imagery may also be diluted by Earth imagery that is available free of charge.\nThe U.S. Government and foreign governments may develop, construct, launch and operate their own imagery satellites, which could reduce their need to rely on commercial suppliers. In addition, such governments could sell or provide free of charge Earth imagery from their satellites in the commercial market and thereby compete with our imagery products and services. Also, governments may at times make our imagery freely available for humanitarian purposes, which could impair our revenue growth with non-governmental organizations. These governments could also subsidize the development, launch and operation of imagery satellites by our current or future competitors.\nOur competitors or potential competitors could, in the future, offer satellite-based imagery or other products and services with more attractive features than our products and services. The emergence of new remote imaging technologies or the continued growth of low-cost imaging satellites, could negatively affect our marketing efforts. More importantly, if competitors develop and launch satellites or other imagery content sources with more advanced capabilities and technologies than ours, or offer services at lower prices than ours, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Due to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors, the selling price of our products and services may further decrease. If we are unable to offset decreases in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or by adjusting our product mix, our revenue and operating margins may decline and our financial position may be harmed.\nWe are dependent on resellers of our imagery for a portion of our revenue. If these resellers fail to market or sell our products and services successfully, our business would be harmed.\nIn 2015, we generated $68.6 million, or 9.8%, of our total revenue from foreign and domestic resellers. We rely on foreign resellers and partners to market and sell the majority of our products and services in the international market. We have intensified our efforts to further develop our operations in overseas markets, however, our foreign resellers and partners may not have the skill or experience to develop regional commercial markets for our imagery products and services, or may have competing interests that negatively affect their sales of our products and services. If we fail to enter into reseller agreements on a timely basis or if our resellers and partners fail to market and sell our imagery products and services successfully, these failures could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, we have contracted with a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services to us such as construction of our satellites and launch vehicles, and management of certain remote ground terminals and DAP facilities. If these vendors are unable to meet our needs because they fail to perform adequately, are unable to match new technological requirements or problems, or are unable to dedicate engineering and other resources necessary to provide the services contracted for, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. While alternative sources for these products and services exist, we may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Furthermore, our vendors may request changes in pricing, payment terms or other contractual obligations, which could cause us to make substantial additional investments.\nBreach of our system security measures or loss of our secure facility clearance and accreditation could result in interruption, delay or suspension of our ability to provide our products and services, and could result in loss of current and future business, including our U.S. Government contracts.\nOur business and our reputation could be negatively impacted by cyber attacks, other security breaches and other disruptions. Our business involves the transmission and storage of large quantities of electronic data, including the imagery comprising our ImageLibrary. In addition, our business is becoming increasingly web-based, allowing our customers to access and take delivery of imagery from our ImageLibrary over the Internet. From time to time, we have experienced computer viruses and other forms of third party attacks on our systems that, to date, have not had a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you, however, that future attacks will not materially adversely affect our business. Despite the implementation and continued upgrading of security measures, our network infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses, unauthorized third party access or other problems caused by third parties. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to otherwise infect or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nWe may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. If unauthorized parties gain access to our information or our systems, they may be able to misappropriate assets or sensitive information (e.g., customer information), cause interruption in our operations, cause the loss of imagery from our Image Library, corrupt data or computers, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. In addition, a security breach that involves classified or other sensitive government information or certain controlled technical information, could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and could result in loss of our secure facility clearance and other accreditations, loss of our government contracts, loss of access to classified information, loss of export privileges or debarment as a government contractor. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web based products and services we offer as well as increase the number of countries within which we do business.\nChanges in U.S. Government policy regarding use of commercial data providers, or material delay or cancellation of planned U.S. Government EnhancedView programs may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our ability to achieve our growth objectives.\nCurrent U.S. Government policy encourages the U.S. Government\u2019s use of commercial data providers to support U.S. national security objectives. We are considered by the U.S. Government to be a commercial data provider. U.S. Government policy is subject to change and any change in policy away from supporting the use of commercial data providers to meet U.S. Government imagery needs could materially affect our revenue and our ability to achieve our growth objectives.\nIf our satellites fail to operate as intended, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur satellites employ advanced technologies and sensors that are exposed to severe environmental stresses in space that could affect our satellites\u2019 performance. Hardware component problems in space could lead to deterioration in performance or loss of functionality of a satellite. In addition, human operators may execute improper implementation commands that may negatively impact a satellite\u2019s performance. Exposure of our satellites to an unanticipated catastrophic event, such as a meteor shower or a collision with space debris, could reduce the performance of, or completely destroy, the affected satellite. We cannot assure you that our satellites will continue to operate successfully in space throughout their expected operational lives. Even if a satellite is operated properly, technical flaws in that satellite\u2019s sensors or other technical deficiencies or anomalies could significantly hinder its performance, which could materially affect our ability to collect imagery and market our products and services successfully. While some anomalies are covered by insurance policies, others are not or may not be covered, or may be subject to large deductibles.\nIf we suffer a partial or total loss of a deployed satellite, we would need a significant amount of time and would incur substantial expense to replace that satellite. We may experience other problems with our satellites that may reduce their performance. During any period of time in which a satellite is not fully operational, we may lose most or all of the revenue that otherwise would have been derived from that satellite. In addition, we may not have on hand, or be able to obtain in a timely manner, the necessary funds to cover the cost of any necessary satellite replacement. Our inability to repair or replace a defective satellite or correct any other technical problem in a timely manner could result in a significant loss of revenue. If a satellite experiences a significant anomaly such that it becomes impaired or is no longer functional, it would significantly impact our business, prospects and profitability.\nLoss of, or damage to, a satellite may require us to seek additional financing from outside sources, which we may be unable to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.\nThe expected operational lives of our satellites are affected by a number of factors, including the quality of design and construction, the supply of fuel, the expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels, the durability of various satellite components and the orbits and space environments in which the satellites are placed and operated. The failure of satellite components could cause damage to or loss of the use of a satellite before the end of its expected operational life. Electrostatic storms or collisions with other objects could also damage our satellites. We cannot assure you that each satellite will remain in operation until the end of its expected operational life.\nAdditionally, our review of satellite lives could extend or shorten the depreciable lives of our satellites, which would have an impact on the depreciation we recognize, as well as certain deferred revenue, which is tied to the life of the satellites. Furthermore, we expect the performance of each satellite to decline gradually near the end of its expected operational life. We can offer no assurance that our satellites will maintain their prescribed orbits or remain operational.\nWe anticipate using funds generated from operations to fund the construction and launch of any future satellites, including WorldView-4. If we do not generate sufficient funds from operations, we may need to obtain additional financing from outside sources to deploy any future satellites. If we do not generate sufficient funds from operations and cannot obtain financing, we will not be able to deploy any future satellites or be able to replace any of our operating satellites at the end of their operational lives. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital on favorable terms or on a timely basis, if at all, to develop or deploy additional high-resolution satellites.\nNew satellites are subject to construction and launch delays, launch failures, damage or destruction during launch, the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations.\nDelays in the construction of WorldView-4 and other future satellites and the procurement of requisite components and launch vehicles, limited availability of appropriate launch windows, possible delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, satellite damage or destruction during launch, launch failures, or incorrect orbital placement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of, or damage to, a satellite due to a launch failure could result in significant delays in anticipated revenue to be generated by that satellite. Any significant delay in the commencement of service of a satellite due to a launch failure would delay and potentially permanently reduce the revenue anticipated to be generated by that satellite. In addition, we may not be able to accommodate affected customers with our other satellites until a replacement satellite is available, and we may not have on hand, or be able to obtain in a timely manner, the necessary funds to cover the cost of any necessary satellite replacement. Any launch delay, launch failure, underperformance, delay or perceived delay could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\nLimited insurance coverage, pricing and availability may prevent us from obtaining insurance to cover all risks of loss.\nWe intend to insure certain satellites in our constellation to the extent that insurance remains available at acceptable premiums. The insurance proceeds received in connection with a partial or total impairment of the functional capacity of any of our satellites would not be sufficient to cover the replacement cost, if we choose to do so, of an equivalent high-resolution satellite. In addition, this insurance will not protect us against all losses to our satellites due to specified exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations and it may be difficult to insure against certain risks, including a partial deterioration in satellite performance and satellite re-entry. As of December 31, 2015, we maintained an aggregate of $730.0 million of insurance coverage on our WorldView-1, WorldView-2, WorldView-3, and GeoEye-1 satellites for the policy period from October 2015 to October 2016. In 2015, we did not insure our IKONOS or QuickBird satellites against functional capacity impairment, given the stage of their useful lives. We maintained $431.0 million of insurance for our WorldView-4 satellite, which is currently under construction, for the policy period from May 2015 to May 2018.\nThe price and availability of insurance have fluctuated significantly since we began offering commercial services in 2001. Although we have historically been able to obtain insurance coverage for our in-orbit satellites, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. We intend to maintain insurance for our operating satellites, however, any determination we make as to whether to obtain insurance coverage will depend on a variety of factors, including the availability of insurance in the market, the cost of available insurance and the redundancy of our operating satellites. Insurance market conditions or factors outside our control at the time we are in the market for the required insurance, such as failure of a satellite using similar components, could cause premiums to be significantly higher than current estimates and could reduce amounts of available coverage. Higher premiums on insurance policies will increase our costs and consequently reduce our operating income by the amount of such increased premiums. If the terms of in-orbit insurance policies become less favorable than those currently available, there may be limits on the amount of coverage that we can obtain or we may not be able to obtain insurance at all. Even if obtained, our in-orbit operations insurance will not cover any loss in revenue incurred as a result of a partial or total satellite loss.\nWe are highly dependent upon our ImageLibrary and our failure or inability to protect and maintain the Earth- imagery content stored in our ImageLibrary could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our Earth-imagery content and our ImageLibrary against damage that may be caused by fire and other natural disasters, power failures, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses, equipment malfunction or inadequacy, firewall breach or other events. The satellite imagery content we collect is downloaded directly to our facilities and then stored in our ImageLibrary for sale to customers. We back up our imagery and permanently store it with a third party data storage provider. Notwithstanding precautions we have taken to protect our ImageLibrary, there can be no assurance that a natural disaster or other event would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide access to or deliver imagery from our ImageLibrary to our customers. The temporary or permanent loss or disruption of access to our ImageLibrary could impair our ability to supply current and future customers with imagery content, have a negative impact on our revenue and cause harm to our reputation. Any impairment in our ability to supply our customers with imagery content could affect our ability to retain or attract customers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market may not accept our imagery products and services. You should not rely upon our historic growth rates as an indicator of future growth.\nWe cannot accurately predict whether our products and services will achieve significant market acceptance or whether there will be a market for our products and services on terms we find acceptable. Market acceptance of our commercial high-resolution Earth imagery and related products and services depends on a number of factors, including the quality, scope, timeliness, sophistication, price and the availability of substitute products and services. Lack of significant market acceptance of our offerings, or other products and services that utilize our imagery, delays in acceptance, failure of certain markets to develop or our need to make significant investments to achieve acceptance by the market would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not continue to grow in line with historical rates or at all. If we are unable to achieve sustained growth, we may be unable to execute our business strategy, expand our business or fund other liquidity needs and our prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy, both in the U.S. and internationally. The Company\u2019s business may be materially and adversely impacted by changes in United States or global economic conditions including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability of capital, energy and commodity prices, trade laws, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending on our products and services as their business and/or budgets are impacted by economic conditions. The inability of current and potential customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nOur international business exposes us to risks relating to increased regulation, currency fluctuations, and political or economic instability in foreign markets, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nIn 2015, approximately 28.9% of our revenue was derived from international sales, and we intend to continue to pursue international contracts. International operations are subject to certain risks, such as: changes in domestic and foreign governmental regulations and licensing requirements; deterioration of relations between the United States and a particular foreign country; increases in tariffs and taxes and other trade barriers; changes in political and economic stability, including fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, which may make payment in U.S. dollars, as provided for under our existing contracts, more expensive for foreign customers and affect their budgets; effects of austerity programs or similar significant budget reduction programs; potential preferences by prospective customers to purchase from local (non-U.S.) sources; and difficulties in obtaining or enforcing judgments in foreign jurisdictions. These risks are beyond our control and could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend upon our ability to attract, train and retain employees. Our inability to do so, or the loss of key personnel, would seriously harm our business.\nBecause of the specialized nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel. The loss of one or more of our senior management personnel could result in the loss of knowledge, experience and technical expertise within the satellite imagery sector, which would be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. The competition for qualified personnel in the commercial high-resolution Earth imagery industry is intense. Due to this intense competition, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. Additionally, our ability to effectively manage change of people and/or processes within the organization could negatively impact our ability to deliver on the objectives and plans of the Company.\nOur restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate.\nWe have undertaken cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve operating efficiencies, optimize our asset base and generate cost savings. For example, we have recently undertaken restructuring plans intended to reduce global headcount, rationalize our real estate footprint, realize efficiencies from re-engineering processes and enhancing system workflows, and implement other efficiency initiatives. We cannot be certain that we will be able to complete these initiatives as planned or without business interruption, or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nAcquisitions could result in adverse impacts on our operations and in unanticipated liabilities and we may be unable to successfully integrate acquired companies.\nTo integrate acquired businesses we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business. Also, the integration of acquired businesses may require that we incur significant restructuring charges. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including: diversion of management\u2019s attention from the normal operation of our business; potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies; disruption of business relationships with current customers; uncertainties that may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel; difficulties managing and integrating operations; the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at acquired companies; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements; and exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.\nAny future acquisitions may require additional equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders, or additional debt financing, which could increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings. Any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms. As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions in the future. These and other factors may harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have acquired other companies and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets. We review goodwill and our amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may be required to record a significant non-cash charge in our consolidated financial statements in the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nChanges in U.S. or foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur industry is highly regulated due to the sensitive nature of satellite technology. We cannot assure you that the laws and regulations governing our business and operations, including the distribution of satellite imagery, will not change in the future. Our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected if we are required to alter our business operations to comply with such changes or if our ability to sell our products and services on a global basis is reduced or restricted due to increased U.S. or foreign government regulation.\nOur international operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. If we or our agents fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA, or similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, governmental authorities in the United States or elsewhere, as applicable, could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals could result in service interruptions or could impede us from executing our business plan.\nNOAA Approvals. Our business requires licenses from NOAA. Under our NOAA licenses, the U.S. Government reserves the right to interrupt service or limit our ability to distribute satellite images when foreign policy or U.S. national security interests are affected. In addition, NOAA has the right to review and approve the terms of certain of our agreements with international customers, including our DAP customers. We currently have the necessary approvals for our existing international customers. However, such reviews in the future could delay or prohibit us from executing new international agreements. The inability to get approvals for DAP customers could materially affect our ability to establish and grow our DAP business. In addition, should we not get approvals in a timely manner, our products and services may not be competitive.\nExport Approvals. The ground station equipment and related technology that is purchased by certain of our DAP customers is controlled under the ITAR. We, or our suppliers, must obtain export licenses from the Department of State, and in some cases from foreign government agencies, in order to export ground station equipment and related technology to our DAP customers. Export licenses can take up to three months or longer to be processed and neither the Department of State nor any corresponding foreign government agency are obligated to approve any license application. Our inability or the inability of our suppliers to get required export approvals for equipment and technology supporting the DAP could materially affect our ability to establish and grow our DAP business.\nFCC Approvals. Our operation of satellites and ground terminals also requires licenses from the FCC. The FCC regulates the construction, launch and operation of our satellites, the use of satellite frequency spectrum and the licensing of our ground terminals located within the United States. We are also subject to the FCC\u2019s rules and regulations and the terms of our licenses, which require us to comply with various operating conditions and requirements. The current licenses of our satellites expire between 2023 and 2024 and those of our ground terminals expire between 2019 and 2024. While the FCC generally renews licenses routinely, there can be no assurance that our licenses will be renewed at their expiration dates on favorable terms or without adverse conditions. Failure to renew these licenses could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and conduct our business as currently expected.\nInternational Registration and Approvals. The use of the satellite frequency spectrum internationally is subject to the rules and requirements of the ITU. Additionally, satellite operators must abide by the specific laws of the countries in which downlink services are provided from the satellite to ground terminals within such countries. The FCC has coordinated the operations for each of our satellites pursuant to the ITU requirements. Coordination of our satellites with other satellite systems is required by the ITU to help prevent harmful frequency interference from or into existing or planned satellite operations. We do not expect significant issues relating to the coordination of our satellites due to the nature of satellite imaging operations.\nOur foreign DAP customers are responsible for securing necessary licenses and operational authority to use the required spectrum in each country into which we will downlink high resolution commercial Earth imagery. If such customers are not successful in obtaining the necessary approvals, we will not be able to distribute real-time imagery to those customers. Our inability to offer real-time access service in a significant number of foreign countries could negatively affect our business. In addition, regulatory provisions in countries where we wish to operate may impose unduly burdensome restrictions on our operations. Our business may also be adversely affected if the national authorities where we plan to operate adopt treaties, regulations or legislation unfavorable to foreign companies.\nGovernment audits of our contracts could result in a decrease in our earnings and/or have a negative effect on our cash position following an audit adjustment.\nOur government contracts are subject to cost audits, which may occur several years after the period to which the audit relates. If an audit identifies significant unallowable costs, we could incur a material charge to our earnings or reduction in our cash position.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Investment in Our Common Stock\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nIn connection with our acquisition of GeoEye, on January 31, 2013, we entered into a seven-year $550.0 million senior secured term loan facility due February 1, 2020 (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), a five-year $150.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility due February 1, 2018 (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Term Loan, the \u201c2013 Credit Facility\u201d) and issued $600.0 million of 5.25% senior notes due February 1, 2021 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d), the proceeds of which, along with cash on hand, were used to pay the cash consideration under the merger agreement, to refinance certain of our debt and GeoEye\u2019s outstanding debt assumed in the business combination and pay fees and expenses related to the transactions. Our indebtedness could have several consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments; requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, return of capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and future business opportunities; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nOur 2013 Credit Facility and Senior Notes contain a number of restrictions and covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders, grant liens on our assets, sell assets, enter into a new or different line of business, enter into transactions with our affiliates, merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and enter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nOur ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under our 2013 Credit Facility and Senior Notes could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. If our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was $1,134.9 million. Our balance as of December 31, 2015 was $1,109.9 million which was net of discounts and issuance costs of $25.0 million and represented 47.1% of our total capitalization. Our indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay, when due, the principal, interest or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness.\nWe expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Factors that could contribute to the volatility of our stock include, but are not limited to: termination or expiration of one or more of our key contracts, or a change in scope or purchasing levels under one or more of our contracts, including the EnhancedView Contract, our DAP contracts or other large contracts; unfounded rumors and leaks of information, or formal announcements regarding federal budget cuts, including, but not limited to, reduction in budgets affecting the Department of Defense; failure of our satellites to operate as designed; loss or damage to any of our satellites; changes in U.S. or foreign governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals, clearances or future applications; our announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements regarding new products or services, enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments; changes in the availability of insurance; changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock; changes in our published forecast of future results of operations; fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us; success of competitive products and services; changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances or repurchases of securities, sales of large blocks of common stock by our stockholders or the incurrence of additional debt; investors\u2019 general perception of us, including any perception of misuse of sensitive information; changes in general global economic and market conditions; changes in industry conditions; business disruptions, costs and future events related to shareholder activism, and changes in regulatory and other dynamics.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies in the technology sector, which have often been unrelated to their operating performance or prospects for future operations. These broad fluctuations may adversely impact the market price of our common stock. Future market movements may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include: the existence of a classified board of directors; limitations on the removal of directors; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations; the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; the ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws; and provisions that permit the redemption of stock from foreign stockholders where necessary, in the judgment of our board of directors, to protect our licenses and registrations.\nIf we are unable to repurchase our stock at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.\nIn the second half of 2014, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $205.0 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock through December 31, 2015. In October 2015, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved an additional $130.0 million of authorized share repurchases of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock through December 31, 2016. The approval increased the total authorized amount under the program to $335.0 million. The stock repurchase program may require the use of a significant portion of our cash earnings. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or finance future growth opportunities, new product development initiatives and unanticipated capital expenditures which could adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to repurchase stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any stock, and it may be limited or terminated at any time without notice. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us, and may negatively impact our stock price.", "PERMNO": 92924, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "DGI"}
