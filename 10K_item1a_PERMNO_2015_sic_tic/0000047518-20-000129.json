{"cik": "47518", "company": "Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-11-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves risks related to economic, market, regulatory and legislative factors in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with the other information contained herein. The risks described below are not the only risks faced by Hillrom. Additional risks not currently known or considered immaterial also might result in adverse effects on our business. Any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, future results or cash flows. The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the related effects on public health.\nIn December 2019, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China that has since spread to nearly all regions of the world. The outbreak was subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. To date, the COVID-19 outbreak and preventive measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and significant disruption in global financial markets.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation measures, we implemented changes in our business in March 2020 to protect our employees and customers through appropriate health and safety protocols. For example, we installed physical barriers between employees in production facilities, implemented extensive cleaning and sanitation processes for both production and office administration spaces, and implemented broad work-from-home initiatives for employees in our administrative functions. Implementing these measures resulted in additional costs in fiscal 2020, which we expect will continue in fiscal 2021 as we work to address employee safety. These additional costs did not have a material impact on our Statements of Consolidated Income during fiscal 2020, and we anticipate a similar impact for fiscal 2021.\nAlthough we experienced some challenges in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, including declines in revenue related to project delays in our care communications business and reduced demand for certain of our patient exam and diagnostic products, at this time, we have not experienced a negative impact on our liquidity or results of operations. While we generally expect the level of demand for our products negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to recover as we progress through fiscal 2021, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, including the nature and timing of when\ndemand recovery may occur. The continued spread of COVID-19 could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects in a number of ways in the future. For example, it could, among other things:\n\u2022interrupt, slow, or render our supply chains inoperable, resulting in more expensive alternative sources of labor and materials or an inability to find such alternative sources of labor and materials for our products;\n\u2022subject us to governmental mandates and quarantines that may require forced shutdowns of our facilities for extended or indefinite periods due to public health measures;\n\u2022increase regulation of our industry, up to and including the exercise of war powers under The Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, which could require us to turn over our production capabilities to the U.S. Government;\n\u2022substantially interfere with general commercial activity related to our customer base if our customers' businesses are affected by the outbreak, including through delays or reductions of purchases of our products;\n\u2022diminish our ability to adequately predict customer demand for our products, which could adversely impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels;\n\u2022cause health care providers to limit or restrict access to their facilities to only essential personnel for a material amount of time, adversely impacting our ability to complete installations of our care communications offerings and operating room equipment, and limiting contact with our sales personnel;\n\u2022reduce the number of ambulatory care or office visits if health care providers prioritize pandemic-related treatment and governmental and industry associations recommend the deferral of elective surgeries;\n\u2022cause our employees, including key executives, our production and service workforce and functional team members to become ill, quarantined or otherwise unable to work or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions;\n\u2022increase absenteeism or cause workplace disruption related to employees working from home or remotely;\n\u2022contribute to adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions, including recession or economic slowdown and disruption of domestic and international credit markets, which could negatively impact our customers' ability to pay us as well as our ability to access capital that could in the future negatively affect our liquidity;\n\u2022result in the establishment of trade barriers that disrupt the flow of goods and increase costs associated with logistics and transportation;\n\u2022decrease our ability to grow our business through mergers, acquisitions and other similar business arrangements during any such pandemic or other outbreak as targets focus on operating their respective businesses;\n\u2022negatively impact innovation and development of new products as our research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) teams may be required to work from home and resources and energy may be redirected during any such outbreak; or\n\u2022contribute to a recession or market correction that could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid, and given its inherent uncertainty, it could have an adverse impact on our business in the future. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, suppliers, service providers and business partners. If COVID-19 continues to spread and escalate domestically or internationally, or if governments impose additional measures intended to mitigate the spread and related effects of the pandemic, the risks described above could be elevated significantly.\nShould these conditions persist for a prolonged period, the COVID-19 pandemic, including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and could heighten many of our known risks described in this Item 1A. Risk Factors, any of which could have a material effect on us.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe face significant uncertainty in our industry due to government health care reform, healthcare reform laws, changes in Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental medical program reimbursements and for which we cannot predict how such reforms will impact our operating results.\nIn March 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted and President Obama signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act (H.R. 3590) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (H.R. 4872) (collectively, \u201cthe Healthcare Reform Act\u201d). The provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time. However, other provisions of the legislation, including Medicare provisions, aim to decrease costs through comparative effectiveness research, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies could result in pricing pressure or negatively impact the demand for our products.\nWe cannot predict with certainty what additional future health care initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, or what the ultimate effect of federal health care reform or any future legislation or regulation will have on us. Globally, managed care organizations, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, are facing increasing pressure to both control health care utilization and to limit reimbursement. Changes in reimbursement programs or their regulations, including retroactive and prospective rate and coverage criteria changes, competitive bidding for certain products and services, and other changes intended to reduce expenditures (domestically or internationally), could adversely affect the portions of our businesses that are dependent on third-party reimbursement or direct governmental payments. Moreover, to the extent that our healthcare provider customers experience reimbursement pressure resulting in lower revenue for them, their demand for our products and services might decrease. The impact of the above-mentioned items could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure by us or our suppliers to comply with FDA regulations and similar foreign regulations applicable to the products we design, manufacture, install or distribute could expose us to enforcement actions or other adverse consequences.\nWe design, manufacture, install and distribute medical devices that are regulated by the FDA and similar agencies in other countries. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in future product recalls, injunctions preventing the shipment of products or other enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Additionally, certain of our suppliers are subject to FDA regulations. The failure of these suppliers to comply with regulations could adversely affect us as regulatory actions taken by the FDA against those manufacturers can result in product shortages, recalls or modifications. We are also subject to the European Medical Device Regulation, which was adopted by the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) as a common legal framework for all EU member states. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member states to meet certain quality system and safety requirements and ongoing product monitoring responsibilities, and obtain a \u201cCE\u201d marking (i.e., a mandatory conformity marking for certain products sold within the European Economic Area) for their products. Various penalties exist for non-compliance with the laws implementing the European Medical Device Regulations which if incurred, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could be subject to substantial fines or damages and possible exclusion from participation in federal or state health care programs if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business.\nWe are subject to stringent laws and regulations at both the federal and state levels governing the participation of durable medical equipment suppliers in federal and state health care programs. From time to time, the government seeks additional information related to our claims submissions, and in some instances government contractors perform audits of payments made to us under Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs. On occasion, these reviews identify overpayments for which we submit refunds. At other times, our own internal audits identify the need to refund payments. We believe the frequency and intensity of government audits and review processes has grown and we expect this will continue in the future, due to increased resources allocated to these activities at both the federal and state Medicaid level, and greater sophistication in data review techniques.\nIf we are considered to have violated these laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines, damages, possible exclusion from participation in federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and possible recoupment of any overpayments related to such violations. While we believe that our practices materially comply with applicable state and federal requirements, the requirements might be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nFailure to comply with regulations due to our contracts with U.S. government entities could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business contracts with U.S. government entities are subject to specific rules, regulations and approvals applicable to government contractors. U.S. government agencies often reserve the right to conduct audits and investigations of our business practices to assure our compliance with these requirements. Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract terminations, suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. federal government, civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution. In addition, changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, unexpected U.S. developments, such as changes in the funding or structure of Department of Veterans Affairs or other government agencies to which we sell our products and services, might adversely affect sales to U.S. government entities.\nCapital and Credit Risks\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. This level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations, our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we had $1,878.0 million of indebtedness outstanding net of certain issuance costs. As a result of this debt, we have significant demands on our cash resources. The level of debt could, among other things:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including the continued impacts of COVID-19, which could require additional resources or a reallocation of capital to respond to changing priorities;\n\u2022restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to maximize business opportunities;\n\u2022adversely affect our credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing our indebtedness might increase;\n\u2022adversely affect the market price of our common stock;\n\u2022limit our ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt; and\n\u2022cause us to fail to meet payment obligations or otherwise default under our debt, which will give our lenders the right to accelerate the indebtedness and exercise other rights and remedies against us.\nIn addition to the indebtedness we had outstanding as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we might incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could cause the related risks to intensify. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before their respective maturities. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The terms of any additional debt might give the holders rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of any new debt might also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than are currently in place. If we are unable to refinance our debt, we might default under the terms of our indebtedness, which could lead to an acceleration of the required repayment of the outstanding balance. We do not expect that we could repay all of our outstanding indebtedness if the repayment of such indebtedness was accelerated.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement and Securitization Facilities will be at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming all loans under the Senior Credit Agreement and Securitization Facilities were fully drawn, each quarter point change in interest rates, excluding the effects of any interest rate swap agreements, would result in a $5.9 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement and Securitization Facilities. In the future, we may enter into additional interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nOur Senior Credit Agreement, Securitization Facilities and certain derivative instruments use the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of December 2021. We may have to negotiate new credit terms or potentially incur additional indebtedness that rely on an alternative interest rate method to LIBOR as a result of the LIBOR phase out. Any legal or regulatory changes made in response to LIBOR\u2019s future discontinuance may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, a delay in the publication of LIBOR, or changes in the rules or methodologies in LIBOR. In addition, alternative methods to LIBOR may not yet have been established by the end of December 2021, and the impact of such alternative methods may be impossible or impracticable to determine. While we do not\nexpect that the transition from LIBOR will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows, it is still uncertain at this time.\nAdverse developments in general domestic and worldwide economic conditions and instability and disruption of credit markets could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity.\nWe are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions, including recession or economic slowdown and disruption of domestic and international credit markets. The credit and capital markets could experience extreme volatility and disruption that could lead to periods of recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending. These recessionary conditions could cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services. If our customers reduce investments in capital expenditures or utilize their limited capital funds to invest in products that we do not offer, it could negatively impact our operating results. Even if our revenue remains constant, our profitability could decline if there is a shift to sales of product mix or geographic locations with less favorable margins. Moreover, volatility in the credit markets could adversely affect our suppliers\u2019 access to capital and therefore their ability to continue to provide an adequate supply of the materials we use in our products and may result in higher supply costs.\nIf worldwide economic conditions worsen, we would expect our customers to scrutinize costs resulting from pressures on operating margin due to rising supply costs, reduced investment income and philanthropic giving, increased interest expense, reimbursement pressure, reduced elective health care spending and uncompensated care.\nOperating and Product Risks\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that is subject to the risk of declining demand and pricing pressures, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nDemand for our products and services depends in large part on overall demand in the health care market. With the health care market\u2019s increased focus on hospital asset and resource efficiency as well as reimbursement constraints, spending for some of our products could decline over time. Further, the competitive pressures in our industry could cause us to lose market share unless we increase our commercial investments or reduce our prices, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nThe nature of this highly competitive marketplace demands that we successfully introduce new products into the market in a cost-effective manner (more fully detailed below). These factors, along with possible legislative developments and others, might result in significant shifts in market share among the industry\u2019s major participants, which includes us. Accordingly, if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors in terms of new products and diversification of our product portfolio through business acquisitions, then our market share, sales and profitability could be adversely impacted through lower volume or decreased prices.\nOur future financial performance will depend in part on the successful introduction of new products into the marketplace in a cost-effective manner.\nOur future financial performance will depend in part on our ability to influence, anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer preferences and needs, including those impacted by COVID-19, or a possible resurgence of COVID-19. We can provide no assurances that our new products will achieve commercial acceptance in the marketplace. We might not correctly anticipate or identify trends in customer preferences or needs or might identify them later than competitors do. In addition, difficulties in manufacturing or in obtaining regulatory approvals might delay or prohibit introduction of new products into the marketplace. Further, we might not be able to develop and produce new products at a cost that allows us to meet our goals for profitability. We may not be able to obtain patent protection on our new products or be able to defend our intellectual property rights globally. Warranty claims and service costs relating to our new products might be greater than anticipated, and we might be required to devote significant resources to address any quality issues associated with our new products, which could reduce the resources available for further new product development and other matters. In addition, the introduction of new products might also cause customers to defer purchases of existing products.\nFailure to successfully introduce new products in a cost-effective manner, or delays in customer purchasing decisions related to the evaluation of new products, could cause us to lose market share and could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe might not be able to grow or achieve expected cost savings or profitability if we are unable to successfully acquire and integrate, or form business relationships with, other companies.\nWe have in the past, and expect in the future, to grow our business through mergers, acquisitions and other similar business arrangements. We might not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or business relationships, negotiate acceptable terms or receive necessary financing on acceptable terms for such acquisitions or relationships. Additionally, we might become responsible for liabilities associated with businesses that we acquire to the extent they are not covered by indemnification from the sellers or by insurance. Even if we can consummate acquisitions, such acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings and might not be successfully integrated to fully realize the expected benefits. Our integration efforts might also divert management and other resources from other important matters, and we could experience delays or unusual expenses in the integration process, including intangible asset impairments, which could result in significant charges in our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Moreover, the margins for these companies might differ from our historical gross and operating margins resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is significantly dependent on major contracts with GPOs, IDNs, and certain other distributors and purchasers.\nA majority of our U.S. hospital sales and rentals are made pursuant to contracts with hospital GPOs. At any given time, we are typically at various stages of responding to bids, negotiating and renewing expiring GPO agreements. Failure to be included in certain of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, including product sales and service and rental revenue.\nOur participation in such programs often requires increased discounting or restrictions on our ability to raise prices, and failure to participate or to be selected for participation in such programs might result in a reduction of sales to the member hospitals. In addition, the industry is showing an increased focus on contracting directly with health systems or IDNs (which typically represent influential members and owners of GPOs). IDNs and health systems often make key purchasing decisions and have influence over the GPO\u2019s contract decisions, and often request additional discounts or other enhancements. Further, certain other distributors and purchasers have similar processes to the GPOs and IDNs and failure to be included in agreements with these other purchasers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations. Compliance with international laws and regulations, import and export limitations, trade agreements, anti-corruption laws, and exchange controls may be difficult, burdensome and expensive.\nInternational sales represent approximately 32% of our total sales in fiscal 2020. We anticipate that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future. In addition, we have multiple manufacturing facilities and third-party suppliers that are located outside of the United States. As a result, our international sales, as well as our sales in the United States, of products produced or sourced internationally, are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country, such as political instability, economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in tax laws, regulatory and reimbursement programs and policies, and the protection of intellectual property rights. COVID-19 could contribute to these conditions or trigger legislative or regulatory responses that could directly or indirectly effect our business. In addition, our collections of international receivables are subject to economic pressures and the actions of some governmental authorities that have initiated various austerity measures to control health care and other governmental spending.\nWe are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making bribes or other improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to limitations on trade with persons in sanctioned countries. Our exposure to international markets increases the inherent risks of encountering such issues. While our employees, distributors and agents are required to comply with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that our training and internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to severe fines and penalties that could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe might not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and might experience business disruptions and adverse tax consequences associated with restructuring, realignment and cost reduction activities.\nOver the past few years, we have initiated several restructuring, realignment and cost reduction initiatives. While we expect to realize efficiencies from these actions, these activities might not produce the full efficiency and cost reduction benefits we expect. Further, such benefits might be realized later than expected, and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures might be greater than anticipated. If these measures are not successful or sustainable, we might undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in future charges. Moreover, our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans might be adversely affected and we could experience business disruptions with customers and elsewhere if our restructuring and realignment efforts and our cost reduction activities prove ineffective. These actions, the resulting costs, and potential delays or potential lower than anticipated benefits might also impact our foreign tax positions and might require us to record tax reserves against certain deferred tax assets in our international business.\nWe are involved on an ongoing basis in claims, lawsuits and governmental proceedings relating to our operations, as well as product liability or other liability claims that could expose us to adverse judgments or could adversely affect the sales of our products.\nWe are involved in the design, manufacture and sale of health care products, which face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products are alleged to have caused injury or are found to be unsuitable for their intended use. Amongst other claims, we are, from time to time, a party to claims and lawsuits alleging that our products have caused injury or death or are otherwise unsuitable. It is possible that we will receive adverse judgments in such lawsuits, and any such adverse judgments could be material. Although we carry insurance with respect to such matters, this insurance is subject to varying deductibles and self-insured retentions and might not be adequate to cover the full amount of any particular claim. In addition, any such claims could negatively impact the sales of products that are the subject of such claims or other products.\nMaterials and Manufacturing Risks\nIncreased prices for, or unavailability of, raw materials or sub-assemblies used in our products could adversely affect profitability or revenue. Specifically, our results of operations could be adversely affected by high prices for metals, fuel, plastics and other petroleum-based products, and the impact of U.S. and foreign legislation, regulations and trade agreements relating to the materials we import. We also rely on single suppliers for the procurement of several raw materials and sub-assemblies.\nOur profitability is affected by the prices and availability of the raw materials and sub-assemblies used in the manufacture of our products. These prices might fluctuate based on many factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19, or a possible resurgence of COVID-19, labor costs, fuel related delivery costs, competition, and currency exchange rates. Our business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation, regulations and trade agreements relating to the materials we import, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import materials used in our products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, additional workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. Future quotas, duties or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSignificant increases in the cost of raw materials or sub-assemblies that cannot be recovered through increased prices of our products could adversely affect our results of operations. There can be no assurance that the marketplace will support higher prices or that such prices and productivity gains will fully offset any commodity cost increases in the future. We generally have not engaged in hedging transactions with respect to raw material purchases but do enter into fixed price supply contracts at times. Future decisions not to engage in hedging transactions or ineffective hedging transactions might result in increased cost volatility, potentially adversely impacting our profitability.\nOur dependency upon regular deliveries of supplies from certain suppliers means that interruptions or stoppages in such deliveries could adversely affect our operations until arrangements with alternate suppliers could be made. Several of the raw materials and sub-assemblies used to manufacture our products currently are procured only from a single source. If any of these\nsingle-source suppliers were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials for an extended time, we might not be able to manufacture one or more products and our business could suffer. We might not be able to find acceptable alternatives, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs.\nThe majority of our products are manufactured at a single facility or location, and the material damage or loss of, or partial or complete labor-related work stoppage at, one or more of these facilities or locations could prevent us from manufacturing some of the various products we sell.\nWe manufacture most of our products in a single facility or location. If an event (including any weather or natural disaster or disruptions in connection with COVID-19) occurred that resulted in material damage or loss of, or partial or complete labor-related work stoppage at, one or more of these manufacturing facilities or we lacked sufficient labor to fully operate the facility, we might be unable to transfer manufacturing of the relevant products to another facility or location in a cost-effective or timely manner, if at all. This potential inability to transfer production could occur for several reasons, including but not limited to a lack of necessary relevant manufacturing capability at another facility, or the regulatory requirements of the FDA or other governmental regulatory bodies. Such an event could materially negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe might be adversely affected by regulations relating to conflict minerals.\nThe SEC has adopted rules regarding disclosure for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals (commonly referred to as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold) that originate from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and/or adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex and multilayered, we might be unable to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals despite our due diligence procedures, which in turn might harm our reputation. We might also face difficulties in satisfying customers who might require that our products be certified as DRC conflict free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and/or lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals, and we might be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at prices similar to the past, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.\nEmployee and Pension Plan Risks\nThe assets in our pension plans are subject to market disruptions. In addition, our pension plans are underfunded.\nOur primary pension plan invests in a variety of equity and debt securities subject to market risks. In addition, our pension plans are underfunded by $80.1 million based on our projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets as of September 30, 2020. Market volatility and disruption could cause declines in asset values or fluctuations in assumptions used to value our liability and expenses. If this occurs, we might need to make additional pension plan contributions and our pension expense in future years might increase.\nA portion of our workforce is unionized, and we could face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.\nApproximately 8% of our employees in the United States (including contingent workers) work under collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 65% of our employees outside the United States (including contingent workers) work under various collective bargaining arrangements and/or national trade union agreements. Although we have not recently experienced any significant work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements, we cannot ensure that such a stoppage will not occur in the future. The two collective bargaining agreements at our primary U.S. manufacturing facility expire in January 2021 and January 2022, respectively. Our inability to negotiate satisfactory new agreements or a labor disturbance at one of our principal facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe might not be able to attract, retain and develop key personnel.\nOur future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified personnel, and as competition for such personnel is intense, there can be no assurance that we can do so in the future.\nCybersecurity and Information Technology Risks\nThe rationalization and transformation of our Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) software solutions and other information technology systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations.\nWe are in the process of rationalizing and transforming our ERP software solutions and other complementary information technology systems, which is expected to be completed over the next several years. The implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on the coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. We could experience changes in our operational processes and internal controls, which in turn could require significant capital investments and change management, including recruiting and training of qualified personnel. The interdependence of these solutions and systems is key to the successful completion of the initiatives. The failure of any one solution or system could have a significant impact on our business processes and information systems, including loss or corruption of data, delayed shipments, decreases in productivity as our personnel and third-party providers implement and become familiar with new systems, increased costs and lost revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our overall information technology infrastructure and as a result, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nDifficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or system failures could also result in significant disruptions to our business, the incurrence of unanticipated expenses and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from key strategic initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are increasingly dependent on the consistent functioning of our information technology and cybersecurity systems along with our information technology dependent product portfolios. If we are exposed to any intrusions, disruptions, corruption, or destruction, or if we fail to maintain the integrity of our systems or products, or the privacy of our data, our business and our reputation could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are increasingly dependent on consistent functioning of our information technology and cybersecurity systems for our infrastructure and software-based products. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, regulatory standards, integration of acquisitions, and the increasing need to protect patient, customer and supplier information. The new EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became applicable on May 25, 2018, imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance. Our products include technologies that support connectivity and decision support infrastructure, which could be subject to intrusion, disruption or corruption and could impact the quality of care patients receive or the confidentiality of patient information. In addition, third parties might attempt to hack into our products or systems and might obtain proprietary information. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. If we fail to maintain or protect our information technology and cybersecurity systems and information technology dependent products effectively, we could lose existing customers or suppliers, have difficulty attracting new customers or suppliers, have problems that adversely impact internal controls, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers and suppliers, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of these systems, as well as any data breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTax Risks\nUnfavorable outcomes related to uncertain tax positions could result in significant tax liabilities.\nWe have recorded tax benefits related to various uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. While we believe our positions are appropriate, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), state or foreign tax authorities could disagree with our positions, which could result in a significant tax payment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur stock price and trading volume has been, and may continue to be, volatile from time to time and we might experience continued fluctuations in the future that could negatively impact the value of our outstanding shares.\nThe market for our common stock has, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that might have been unrelated to our operating performance. We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:\n\u2022new, or changes in, analyst recommendations, guidelines or studies that could affect the use of our products;\n\u2022announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, including changes in reimbursement rates or regulatory requirements, proposed and completed acquisitions, or the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022published studies and reports relating to our products and markets in which we participate;\n\u2022quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results;\n\u2022general conditions in the U.S. or worldwide economy, including the impact of COVID-19 that has spread globally;\n\u2022our stock repurchase program;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations;\n\u2022new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;\n\u2022developments in relationships with our customers and suppliers;\n\u2022the implementation of health care reform legislation and the adoption of additional reform legislation in the future; and\n\u2022the ability to or extent of integrating our acquisitions.\nAny such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 52716, "SIC": 2590, "TIC": "HRC"}
