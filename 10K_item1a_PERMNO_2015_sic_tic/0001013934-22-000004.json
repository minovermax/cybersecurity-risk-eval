Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in the documents incorporated by reference herein before making an investment decision. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially harm our business, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could cause you to suffer a partial or complete loss of your investment. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially harm our business and operations. See \u201cCautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Extensive Regulation of Our U.S. Business\nIf Strayer University and Capella University fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements for higher education institutions, they could face significant monetary or other liabilities and penalties, including loss of access to federal student loans and grants for their students.\nAs providers of higher education, Strayer University and Capella University are subject to extensive laws and regulation on both the federal and state levels and by accrediting agencies. In particular, the Higher Education Act and related regulations subject Strayer University, Capella University, and all other higher education institutions that participate in the various Title IV programs to significant regulatory scrutiny.\nThe Higher Education Act mandates specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following components of the higher education regulatory triad: (1) the federal government through the Department of Education; (2) the accrediting agencies recognized by the Secretary of Education; and (3) state education regulatory bodies.\nIn addition, other federal agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and Federal Communications Commission and various state agencies and state attorneys general enforce consumer protection, calling and texting, marketing, privacy and data security, and other laws applicable to post-secondary educational institutions. Findings of noncompliance could result in monetary damages, fines, penalties, injunctions, or restrictions or obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Some of these laws also include private rights of action.\nOn October 8, 2021, the Department of Education announced establishment of an Office of Enforcement within the Department\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid, designed to strengthen oversight over and enforcement against postsecondary schools that participate in federal student loan, grant, and work-study programs. The Office of Enforcement restores an office first established by the Department in 2016. The Office of Enforcement will be comprised of four existing divisions: Administrative Actions and Appeals Services Group, Borrower Defense Group, Investigations Group, and Resolution and Referral Management Group. The Department intends the Office of Enforcement to coordinate with other state and federal partners, including the Department of Justice, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general.\nOn October 6, 2021 the FTC announced that it is resurrecting Penalty Offense Authority under Section 5(m) of the FTC Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). Under the Act, the FTC may secure penalties against entities not a party to an original proceeding if the FTC\ncan show that the entity had actual knowledge that the conduct in question was found to be unfair or deceptive. In an effort to establish actual knowledge and create a pathway for penalties in the event of post-notice acts or practices, the FTC issued that same day an informational notice to the 70 largest for-profit schools based on enrollment and revenues. The notice included a list of acts and practices that the FTC has determined are unfair or deceptive, including but not limited to acts relating to misrepresentation of employment opportunities and other benefits, together with citation to various prior determinations from cases previously litigated by the FTC. Strayer and Capella University received the FTC\u2019s notice on October 7, 2021, although the FTC made clear that receipt of the notice itself does not reflect any assessment as to whether Capella or Strayer has engaged in deceptive or unfair conduct.\nThe laws, regulations, standards, and policies applicable to our business frequently change, and changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, ability to communicate with prospective students, receipt of funds under Title IV programs, or costs of doing business. The Department of Education periodically engages in negotiated rulemaking sessions to revise regulations that govern the federal Title IV student financial aid programs. As discussed in Note 22, Regulation, in the consolidated financial statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report under \u201cCurrent Negotiated Rulemaking,\u201d the Department of Education has convened negotiated rulemaking committees to address issues such as borrower defense to repayment, misrepresentation, mandatory arbitration agreements, gainful employment rules, and federal government oversight into changes in ownership for institutions of higher education. Certain proposals related to these issues could raise the cost of compliance for Strayer University or Capella University or require changes in the educational programs offered by Strayer University and Capella University in order to comply with new rules. We cannot predict whether the Department of Education will promulgate any regulations that would negatively affect Strayer University or Capella University.\nTitle IV requirements are enforced by the Department of Education and, in some instances, by private plaintiffs. If Strayer University and Capella University are found not to be in compliance with these laws, regulations, standards, or policies, they could lose access to Title IV program funds, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nCongressional examination of for-profit post-secondary education could lead to legislation or other governmental action that may negatively affect the industry.\nSince 2010, Congress has increased its focus on for-profit higher education institutions, including regarding participation in Title IV programs and oversight by the Department of Defense of tuition assistance and by the VA of veterans education benefits for military service members and veterans, respectively, attending for-profit colleges. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and other congressional committees have held hearings into, among other things, the proprietary education sector and its participation in Title IV programs, the standards and procedures of accrediting agencies, credit hours and program length, the portion of federal student financial aid going to proprietary institutions, and the receipt of military tuition assistance and veterans education benefits by students enrolled at proprietary institutions. Strayer University and Capella University have cooperated with these inquiries. A number of legislators have variously requested the Government Accountability Office to review and make recommendations regarding, among other things, recruitment practices, educational quality, student outcomes, the sufficiency of integrity safeguards against waste, fraud, and abuse in Title IV programs, and the percentage of proprietary institutions\u2019 revenue coming from Title IV and other federal funding sources.\nThis activity may result in legislation, further rulemaking affecting participation in Title IV programs, and other governmental actions. In addition, concerns generated by congressional activity may adversely affect enrollment in, and revenues of, for-profit educational institutions. Limitations on the amount of federal student financial aid for which our students are eligible under Title IV could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on the renewal and maintenance of Title IV programs.\nThe Higher Education Act is subject to periodic reauthorization. Congress completed the most recent reauthorization through multiple pieces of legislation and may reauthorize the HEA in a piecemeal manner in the future. Additionally, Congress determines the funding level for each Title IV program on an annual basis. Any action or inaction by Congress that significantly reduces funding for Title IV programs or the ability of Strayer University, Capella University, or their students to participate in these programs could materially harm our business. A reduction in government funding levels could lead to lower enrollments at our school and require us to arrange for alternative sources of financial aid for our students. Lower student enrollments or our inability to arrange such alternative sources of funding could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, Strayer University's and Capella University's ability to conduct their business, including obtaining necessary approvals from the Department of Education, may be affected by staffing levels or review procedures at the Department and the volume of applications and other requests to the Department. If the Department lacks adequate personnel or adopts time-consuming procedures or the Department\u2019s workload exceeds its capacity, action by the Department on requests by the\nUniversities could be significantly delayed, and such delays could have a material adverse effect on the Universities and our business.\nStrayer University and Capella University are subject to compliance reviews, which, if they resulted in a material finding of noncompliance, could affect their ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nBecause the Universities operate in a highly regulated industry, they are subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance and related lawsuits by government agencies, accrediting agencies, and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. For example, the Department of Education regularly conducts program reviews of educational institutions that are participating in Title IV programs, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Education regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions. The Department of Education could limit, suspend, or terminate our participation in Title IV programs or impose other penalties such as requiring the Universities to make refunds, pay liabilities, or pay an administrative fine upon a material finding of noncompliance.\nIn June 2019, the Department conducted an announced, on-site program review at Capella University, focused on Capella University\u2019s FlexPath program. The review covered the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 federal financial aid years. The Department issued its preliminary program report on November 13, 2020, and Capella University responded to the report. On February 9, 2021, Capella University received the Department\u2019s Final Program Review Determination, which closed the Program Review without further action required on the part of Capella University.\nOn March 17, 2021, the Department informed Strayer University that it planned to conduct an announced, remote program review. The review commenced on April 19, 2021 and covered the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 federal student financial aid years. On September 21, 2021, Strayer University received the Department\u2019s Final Program Review Determination, which closed the Program Review without further action required on the part of Strayer University.\nOn December 13, 2021, the Department and Strayer University executed a new Program Participation Agreement, approving Strayer University\u2019s continued participation in Title IV programs with full certification through September 30, 2025. On January 18, 2019, consistent with standard procedure upon a Title IV institution\u2019s change of ownership, the Department and Capella University executed a new Provisional Program Participation Agreement, approving Capella University\u2019s continued participation in Title IV programs with provisional certification through December 31, 2022.\nIf either Strayer University or Capella University fails to maintain its institutional accreditation or if its institutional accrediting body loses recognition by the Department of Education, the University would lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nThe loss of Strayer University\u2019s accreditation by Middle States or Middle States\u2019 loss of recognition by the Department of Education would render Strayer University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and would have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, the loss of Capella University\u2019s accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission or the Higher Learning Commission\u2019s loss of recognition by the Department of Education would render Capella University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, an adverse action by Middle States or the Higher Learning Commission other than loss of accreditation, such as issuance of a warning, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Higher Education Act charges the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (\u201cNACIQI\u201d) with recommending to the Secretary of Education which accrediting or state approval agencies should be recognized as reliable authorities for judging the quality of post-secondary institutions and programs. In June 2017, NACIQI renewed its recognition of Middle States for six months and required Middle States to demonstrate compliance with certain requirements. NACIQI reviewed Middle States at its February 2018 meeting and recommended that the Secretary of Education extend its recognition for five years. NACIQI also reviewed the Higher Learning Commission (\u201cHLC\u201d) at its February 2018 meeting and recommended that the Secretary of Education extend its recognition for five years. On July 29, 2020, NACIQI held a meeting to review compliance by HLC with Department of Education requirements for recognized accrediting agencies. On October 26, 2020, a Senior Department Official (\u201cSDO\u201d) found HLC non-compliant, in part. While the SDO required that HLC submit periodic reporting for twelve months, the SDO did not restrict HLC's scope of accreditation or ability to accredit new institutions. HLC did not appeal the Secretary\u2019s decision. Increased scrutiny of accreditors by the Secretary of Education in connection with the Department of Education\u2019s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accreditors or have other adverse consequences.\nIf either Strayer University or Capella University fails to maintain any of its state authorizations, the University would lose its ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs there.\nEach Strayer University campus is authorized to operate and to grant degrees, diplomas, or certificates by the applicable education agency or agencies of the state where the campus is located. Such state authorization is required for students at the campus to participate in Title IV programs. The loss of state authorization would, among other things, limit Strayer University\u2019s ability to operate in that state, render Strayer University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs at least at those state campus locations, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCapella University is registered as a private institution with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education, as required for most post-secondary private institutions that grant degrees at the associate level or above in Minnesota and as required by the Higher Education Act to participate in Title IV programs. The loss of state authorization would, among other things, limit Capella University\u2019s ability to operate in that state, render Capella University ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Capella is also registered in Florida, and registered in Colorado, Georgia and Tennessee for purposes of operating campus centers, and loss of authorization in any of those states could render Capella University ineligible to operate current campus centers or any that may open in the future.\nEffective July 1, 2011, Department of Education regulations provide that an institution is considered legally authorized by a state if the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution, including enforcing applicable state laws, and the institution complies with any applicable state approval or licensure requirements consistent with the new rules. If a state in which Strayer University or Capella University is located fails to comply in the future with the provisions of the new rule or fails to provide the University with legal authorization, it could limit the University\u2019s ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs at least for students in that state and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOn December 19, 2016, the Department of Education published final regulations addressing, among other issues, state authorization of programs offered through distance education. The final regulations, which became effective on May 26, 2019, require an institution offering distance education programs to be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students (other than the state(s) in which the institution is physically located), if such authorization is required by the state, in order to award Title IV aid to such students. An institution could obtain such authorization directly from the state or (except in California) through a state authorization reciprocity agreement. Under those rules, if one of the Universities should fail to obtain or maintain required state authorization to provide post-secondary distance education in a specific state in which the institution is not physically located, the institution could lose its ability to provide distance education in that state and to award Title IV aid to online students in that state. The 2016 rules require that schools disclose all applicable prerequisites for licensure for professional programs and whether the school\u2019s programs satisfy those prerequisites in each state where enrolled students reside. The institution must make direct disclosures to students and prospective students if the institution determines that a program does not meet a state\u2019s professional licensure requirements. If an institution has not made these determinations, it must make a general disclosure to the public to that effect. An institution must also notify students within 14 days if it determines that a program does not meet a state\u2019s requirements. If one of the Universities failed to make any of these disclosures, the Department of Education could limit, suspend, or terminate its participation in Title IV programs or impose other penalties such as requiring the Universities to make refunds, pay liabilities, or pay an administrative fine upon a material finding of noncompliance.\nStrayer University and Capella University participate in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (\u201cSARA\u201d), which originated after the 2016 rulemaking and allows the Universities to enroll students in distance education programs in each SARA member state. Each of the Universities applies separately to non-SARA member states (e.g., California) for authorization to enroll students, if such authorization is required by the state. If Strayer University or Capella University failed to comply with the requirements to participate in SARA or state licensing or authorization requirements to provide distance education in a non-SARA state, the University could lose its ability to participate in SARA or may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization to provide distance education in that non-SARA state, respectively.\nOn November 1, 2019, the Department released final regulations on accreditation and state authorization of distance education, which became effective July 1, 2020. The rules maintain the requirement from the 2016 rule that institutions offering post-secondary education through distance education or correspondence courses to students located in a state in which the institution is not located meet state requirements in that state or participate in a state authorization reciprocity agreement. In addition, an institution must make disclosures readily available to enrolled and prospective students regarding whether programs leading to professional licensure or certification meet state educational requirements, and provide a direct disclosure to students in writing if the program leading to professional licensure or certification does not meet state educational requirements in the state in which the student is located, or if no determination for such state has been made by the institution.\nIf either Strayer University or Capella University fails to obtain recertification by the Department of Education when required, that University would lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nAn institution generally must seek recertification from the Department of Education at least every six years and possibly more frequently depending on various factors, such as whether it is provisionally certified. The Department of Education may also review an institution\u2019s continued eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs, or scope of eligibility and certification, in the event the institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control or expands its activities in certain ways, such as the addition of certain types of new programs, or, in certain cases, changes to the academic credentials that it offers. In certain circumstances, the Department of Education must provisionally certify an institution. The Department of Education may withdraw either University\u2019s certification if the Department determines that the University is not fulfilling material requirements for continued participation in Title IV programs. If the Department of Education does not renew or withdraws either University\u2019s certification to participate in Title IV programs, its students would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds. Such a loss would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEach institution participating in Title IV programs must enter into a Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education. Under the agreement, the institution agrees to follow the Department of Education\u2019s rules and regulations governing Title IV programs. On December 13, 2021, the Department and Strayer University executed a new Program Participation Agreement, approving Strayer University\u2019s continued participation in Title IV programs with full certification through September 30, 2025. On January 18, 2019, consistent with standard procedure upon a Title IV institution\u2019s change of ownership, the Department and Capella University executed a new Provisional Program Participation Agreement, approving Capella University\u2019s continued participation in Title IV programs with provisional certification through December 31, 2022.\nA failure to demonstrate financial responsibility or administrative capability may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, Strayer University and Capella University must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the Higher Education Act and the regulations issued thereunder by the Department of Education, including, among other things, certain standards of financial responsibility and administrative capability. If one of the Universities fails to demonstrate financial responsibility or maintain administrative capability under the Department of Education\u2019s regulations, the University could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or have that eligibility adversely conditioned. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nStudent loan defaults in the U.S. could result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nIn general, under the Higher Education Act, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs if, for three consecutive federal fiscal years, 30% or more of its students who were required to begin repaying their student loans in the relevant federal fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the second federal fiscal year following that fiscal year. Institutions with a cohort default rate equal to or greater than 15% for any of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available are subject to a 30-day delayed disbursement period for first-year, first-time borrowers. In addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs if its default rate for a federal fiscal year was greater than 40%.\nIf we lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs because of high student loan default rates, the loss would have a material adverse effect on our business. Strayer University\u2019s three-year cohort default rates for federal fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018, were 10.4%, 11.3%, and 8.6%, respectively. Capella University\u2019s three-year cohort default rates for federal fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018 were 6.8%, 6.5%, and 5.2%, respectively. The average official cohort default rates for proprietary institutions nationally were 15.2%, 14.7%, and 11.2% for federal fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created significant economic uncertainty and disrupted large portions of the economy. The pandemic and the preventative measures taken to contain the pandemic have caused a substantial increase in unemployment and has had and may continue to have adverse economic consequences. Despite the pause on federal student loan payments and interest accrual, such conditions could result in an increase in the number of borrowers defaulting on their student loans, including among our graduates.\nStrayer University or Capella University could lose its eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or be provisionally certified with respect to such participation if the percentage of its revenues derived from those programs were too high, or could be restricted from enrolling students in certain states if the percentage of the University\u2019s revenues from federal or state programs were too high.\nA proprietary institution may lose its eligibility to participate in the federal Title IV student financial aid program if it derives more than 90% of its revenues, on a cash basis, from Title IV programs for two consecutive fiscal years. A proprietary institution of higher education that violates the 90/10 Rule for any fiscal year will be placed on provisional status for up to two fiscal years. Using the formula specified in the Higher Education Act, Strayer University derived approximately 82.95% of its cash-basis revenues from these programs in 2020. Capella University derived approximately 71.98% of its cash-basis revenues from Title IV program funds in 2020. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which amends the \u201c90/10 Rule\u201d to include \u201call federal education assistance\u201d in the \u201c90\u201d side of the ratio calculation. The legislation requires the Department to conduct a negotiated rulemaking process to modify related Department regulations, which is currently underway through the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility negotiated rulemaking. Meetings of this negotiated rulemaking committee are scheduled to occur January-March 2022. This rulemaking process may result in a definition of \u201cfederal education assistance\u201d that will include tuition assistance programs offered by the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, in addition to the Title IV programs already covered by the 90/10 Rule. Under the legislation, these revisions to the 90/10 Rule would apply to institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Further legislation has been introduced in both chambers of Congress that seek to modify the 90/10 Rule further, including proposals to change the ratio requirement to 85/15 (federal to nonfederal revenue). We cannot predict whether Congress will pass any of these legislative proposals. If one of the Universities were to violate the 90/10 Rule, the loss of eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs would have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain states have also proposed legislation that would prohibit enrollment of their residents based on a state and federal funding threshold that is more restrictive than the federal 90/10 Rule. If such legislation were to be enacted, and the Universities were unable to meet the threshold, loss of eligibility to enroll students in certain states would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe failure by Strayer University or Capella University to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s incentive compensation rules could result in sanctions and other liability.\nIf one of the Universities pays a bonus, commission, or other incentive payment in violation of applicable Department of Education rules or if the Department of Education or other third parties interpret a University\u2019s compensation practices as noncompliant, the University could be subject to sanctions or other liability. Such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe failure by Strayer University or Capella University to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s misrepresentation rules could result in sanctions and other liability.\nThe Higher Education Act prohibits an institution that participates in Title IV programs from engaging in \u201csubstantial misrepresentation\u201d of the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. Final regulations that defined misrepresentation to include \u201cany statement that has the likelihood or tendency to mislead under the circumstances\u201d and \u201cany statement that omits information in such a way as to make the statement false, erroneous, or misleading\u201d were scheduled to take effect July 1, 2017 but, after a series of delays, became effective October 16, 2018. On August 30, 2019, the Department released final Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations that included a new definition of \u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d which became effective July 1, 2020. The final rule defines a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d as: a statement, act, or omission by an eligible school to a borrower (a) that is false, misleading, or deceptive, (b) that was made with knowledge of its false, misleading, or deceptive nature or with a reckless disregard for the truth, and (c) that directly and clearly relates to either (1) enrollment or continuing enrollment at the institution or (2) the provision of educational services for which the loan was made.\nIn the event of substantial misrepresentation, the Department of Education may revoke or terminate an institution\u2019s program participation agreement, limit the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs, deny applications from the institution, such as to add new programs or locations, initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs; relieve the borrower of the obligation to repay federal education loans in whole or in part and require the institution to reimburse the Department of Education for those amounts. If the Department of Education or other third parties interpret statements made by one of the Universities or on the University\u2019s behalf to be in violation of the new regulations, the University could be subject to sanctions and other liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe failure by Strayer University or Capella University to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s credit hour or direct assessment rules could result in sanctions and other liability.\nTitle IV regulations define the term \u201ccredit hour\u201d and require accrediting agencies and state authorization agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institution\u2019s credit hour assignments. If an accreditor does not comply with this requirement, its recognition by the Department of Education could be jeopardized. If an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institution\u2019s programs, the accreditor must notify the Secretary of Education. In addition to the credit hour model, the Department of Education has granted approvals for a small number of institutions, including Capella University, to operate direct assessment academic programs. Instead of measuring student progress through the number of credit hours spent in the course, these direct assessment programs allow students to progress through courses by showing mastery over material through the completion of assessments, sometimes in less time than it would take to complete a course under a credit hour model. If the Department of Education determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition or direct assessment requirements, the Department of Education could impose liabilities or other sanctions. Such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe failure by Strayer University or Capella University to comply with the Clery Act or Title IX could result in sanctions and other liability.\nStrayer University and Capella University must comply with the campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other requirements in the Clery Act, including changes made to the Clery Act by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. On October 20, 2014, the Department of Education promulgated final regulations implementing amendments to the Clery Act. In addition, the Department of Education has interpreted Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs that receive funding from the federal government, to categorize sexual violence as a form of prohibited sex discrimination and to require institutions to follow certain disciplinary procedures with respect to such offenses. Failure to comply with the Clery Act or Title IX requirements or regulations thereunder could result in action by the Department of Education to require corrective action, fine the University, or limit or suspend its participation in Title IV programs, which could lead to litigation and could harm the University\u2019s reputation. In addition, individuals alleging sex discrimination may sue an institution under Title IX for corrective action and monetary damages.\nOn May 6, 2020, the Department of Education published final rules related to implementation of Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs that receive funding from the federal government. The final rules define what constitutes sexual harassment for purposes of Title IX in the administrative enforcement context, describe what actions trigger an institution\u2019s obligation to respond to incidents of alleged sexual harassment, and specify how an institution must respond to allegations of sexual harassment. Among other things, the new rules include a requirement for live hearings on Title IX sexual harassment claims, which includes direct and cross-examination of parties, university-provided advisors (in the event a student or party does not provide an advisor), rulings on questions of relevance by decision-makers, and the creation and maintenance of a record of the live hearing proceedings. The final rule became effective August 14, 2020. On August 24, 2021, the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights issued guidance indicating it would cease enforcement of the rules\u2019 prohibition against consideration of statements made by individuals failing to submit to cross-examination at a live hearing. Failure to comply with these final rules and the resulting sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nStrayer University and Capella University are subject to sanctions if they fail to calculate accurately and make timely payment of refunds of Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\nThe Higher Education Act and Department of Education regulations require the Universities to calculate refunds of unearned Title IV program funds disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational program before completing it. If refunds are not properly calculated or timely paid, the University may be required to post a letter of credit with the Department of Education or be subject to sanctions or other adverse actions by the Department of Education. Such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInvestigations, legislative and regulatory developments, and general credit market conditions related to the student loan industry may result in fewer lenders and loan products and increased regulatory burdens and costs in the U.S.\nThe Higher Education Act regulates relationships between lenders to students and post-secondary education institutions. In 2009, the Department of Education promulgated regulations that address these relationships, and state legislators have also passed or may be considering legislation related to relationships between lenders and institutions. In addition, new procedures introduced and recommendations made by the CFPB create uncertainty about whether Congress will impose new burdens on private student lenders. These developments, as well as legislative and regulatory changes, such as those relating to gainful employment and repayment rates, creating uncertainty in the industry, and general credit market conditions may cause some lenders to decide not to provide certain loan products and may impose increased administrative and regulatory costs. Such\nactions could reduce demand for and/or availability of private education loans, decrease Strayer University\u2019s or Capella University\u2019s non-Title IV revenue, and thereby increase Strayer University\u2019s or Capella University\u2019s 90/10 ratio, and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on one or more third parties for software and services necessary to administer Strayer University's and Capella University's participation in Title IV programs and failure of such a third party to provide compliant software and services, or by us in our use of the software, could cause Strayer University or Capella University to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nBecause each of Strayer University and Capella University is jointly and severally liable to the Department of Education for the actions of third-party Title IV processing software providers, failure of such providers to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on Strayer University or Capella University, including loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. If any of the third-party servicers discontinue providing software and services to one or both of the Universities, we may not be able to replace them in a timely, cost-efficient, or effective manner, or at all, and the Universities could lose their ability to comply with the requirements of Title IV programs. Such developments could adversely affect our enrollment, revenues, and results of operations.\nOur business could be harmed if Strayer University or Capella University experience a disruption in their ability to process student loans under the Federal Direct Loan Program.\nEach of Strayer University and Capella University collected the majority of its fiscal year 2021 total consolidated net revenue from receipt of Title IV financial aid program funds, principally from federal student loans under the Federal Direct Loan Program. Any processing disruptions by the Department of Education may affect our students\u2019 ability to obtain student loans on a timely basis. If either of the Universities experiences a disruption in its ability to process student loans through the Federal Direct Loan Program, either because of administrative challenges on the part of the University or the inability of the Department of Education to process the volume of direct loans on a timely basis, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely and materially affected.\nOur business could be harmed if Congress makes changes to the availability of Title IV funds.\nEach of Strayer University and Capella University collected the majority of its fiscal year 2021 total consolidated net revenue from receipt of Title IV financial aid program funds, principally from federal student loans under the Federal Direct Loan Program. Changes in the availability of these funds or a reduction in the amount of funds disbursed may have a material adverse effect on our enrollment, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Congress eliminated further federal direct subsidized loans for graduate and professional students as of July 1, 2012. On August 9, 2013, Congress passed legislation that ties interest rates on Title IV loans to the rate paid on U.S. Treasury bonds. Interest rates are set every July 1st for loans taken out from July 1st to June 30th of the following year. In July 2012 Congress reduced eligibility for Pell Grants from 18 semesters to 12 semesters. To date, these changes have not had a material impact on our business, but future changes in the availability of Title IV funds could affect students\u2019 ability to fund their education and thus may have a material adverse effect on our enrollment, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAs enforcement of laws related to the accessibility of technology continues to evolve in the U.S., information technology development costs and compliance risks could increase.\nStrayer University\u2019s and Capella University\u2019s online education programs are made available to students through personal computers and other technological devices. For each of these programs, the curriculum makes use of a combination of graphics, pictures, videos, animations, sounds, and interactive content. Federal agencies, including the Department of Education and the Department of Justice, have considered or are considering how electronic and information technology should be made accessible to persons with disabilities. For example, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\"Section 504\"), prohibits discrimination against a person with a disability by any organization that receives federal financial assistance. The Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) prohibits discrimination based on disability in several areas, including public accommodations. In 2010, the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces Section 504, together with the Department of Justice, which enforces the ADA, asserted that requiring the use of technology in a classroom environment when such technology is inaccessible to individuals with disabilities violates Section 504 and the ADA, unless those individuals are provided accommodations or modifications that permit them to receive all the educational benefits provided by the technology in an equally effective and integrated manner. In recent years, the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and third parties have brought enforcement actions against institutions related to website accessibility of online course material. If Strayer University or Capella University is found to have violated Section 504 or the ADA, it may be required to modify existing content and functionality of its online classroom or other uses of technology, including through adoption of specific technical standards. As a result of such enforcement action, or as a result of new laws and regulations that require greater accessibility,\nStrayer University or Capella University may have to modify its online classrooms and other uses of technology to satisfy applicable requirements at potentially substantial cost. As with all nondiscrimination laws that apply to recipients of federal financial assistance, an institution may lose access to certain federal financial assistance if it does not comply with Section 504 requirements. In addition, private parties may file or threaten to file lawsuits alleging failure to comply with laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, such as Section 504 and the ADA, and defending against and resolving such actions may require Strayer University or Capella University to incur costs of litigation and costs to modify its online classrooms and other uses of technology.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur enrollment rate is uncertain, and we may not be able to assess our future enrollments effectively.\nOur ability to grow enrollment depends on a number of factors, including macroeconomic factors like unemployment and the resulting lower confidence in job prospects, and many of the regulatory risks discussed above. Our enrollment in 2022 will be affected by legislative uncertainty and regulatory activity in the U.S., and macroeconomic conditions globally, including those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely that legislative, regulatory, and economic uncertainties will continue for the foreseeable future, and thus it is difficult to assess our long-term growth prospects. Since 2013, we have selectively closed physical locations of Strayer University to align our resources in keeping with the increasing preference of our current students for online course delivery. Although we plan to continue investing selectively in new campus facilities, and to pursue other growth opportunities in the future, there can be no assurance as to what our growth rate will be or as to the steps we may need to take to adapt to the changing regulatory, legislative, and economic conditions.\nAdding new locations, programs, and services is dependent on our forecast of the demand for those locations, programs, and services and on regulatory approvals.\nAdding new locations, programs, and services require us to expend significant resources, including making human capital and financial capital investments, incurring marketing expenses, and reallocating other resources. To open a new location, we are required to obtain appropriate federal, state, and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned, delayed, or halted in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. We cannot assure investors that we will open new locations or add new programs or services in the future, or that any new locations, programs or services will be successful.\nOur future success depends in part upon our ability to recruit and retain key personnel.\nOur success to date has been, and our continuing success will be, substantially dependent upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers, faculty, administrators, and other key personnel. If we cease to employ any of these integral personnel or fail to manage a smooth transition to new personnel, our business could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to update and expand the content of existing academic programs and develop new programs in a cost-effective manner and on a timely basis.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to update and expand the content of our academic programs, develop new programs in a cost-effective manner, and meet students\u2019 needs in a timely manner. Prospective employers of our graduates increasingly demand that their employees possess appropriate technological and other skills. The update and expansion of our existing programs and the development of new programs may not be received favorably by students, prospective employers, or the online education market. If we cannot respond to changes in industry requirements, our business may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs at all, or as quickly as students require, due to regulatory constraints or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing new programs.\nOur financial performance depends in part on our ability to continue to increase awareness of the academic programs we offer among working adult students.\nAwareness of the academic programs we offer among working adult students in the U.S. is critical to the continued acceptance and growth of our programs. Our inability to increase awareness of the programs we offer through effective marketing and advertising could limit our enrollments and negatively affect our business. The following are some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully marketing our programs:\n\u2022the emergence of more successful competitors;\n\u2022customer dissatisfaction with our services and programs;\n\u2022performance problems with our online systems; and\n\u2022our failure to maintain or expand our brand or other factors related to our marketing.\nCongressional and other governmental activities in the U.S. could damage the reputation of Strayer University or Capella University and limit our ability to attract and retain students.\nIn recent years, Congress increased its focus on proprietary educational institutions, including administration of Title IV programs, military tuition assistance, veterans education benefits, and other federal programs. During a prior Administration, the Department of Education indicated to Congress that it intended to increase its regulation of and attention to proprietary educational institutions, and the Government Accountability Office released several reports of investigations into proprietary educational institutions. Several state Attorneys General have also undertaken extensive investigations of proprietary educational institutions. These and other governmental activities, including new regulations on program integrity and gainful employment, even if resulting in no adverse findings or actions against Strayer University or Capella University, singly or cumulatively could affect public perception of proprietary higher education, damage the reputation of Strayer University or Capella University, and limit our ability to attract and retain students.\nWe face strong competition in the post-secondary education market.\nPost-secondary education is highly competitive. We compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges, other for-profit schools, vocational education organizations, and alternatives to higher education, such as employment and military service. Public colleges may offer programs similar to those of our Universities without tuition or at a lower tuition level as a result of government subsidies (including various \"free college\" programs), government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial sources not available to proprietary institutions. Some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. While we believe that our Universities provide valuable education to their students, we may not always accurately predict the drivers of a student or potential students\u2019 decisions to choose among the range of educational and other options available to them. This strong competition could adversely affect our business.\nStrayer University and Capella University, with their online programs, operate in a highly competitive market with rapid technological changes, and they may not compete successfully.\nOnline education is a highly fragmented and competitive market that is subject to rapid technological change. Competitors vary in size and organization from traditional colleges and universities, many of which have some form of online education programs, to for-profit schools, corporate universities, and software companies providing online education and training software. We expect the online education and training market to be subject to rapid changes in technologies. The Universities\u2019 success will depend on their ability to adapt to these changing technologies.\nThe Company relies on exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property, and competitors may attempt to duplicate our programs and methods.\nThird parties may attempt to develop competing programs or duplicate or copy aspects of our curriculum, online library, quality management, and other proprietary content. Any such attempt, if successful, could adversely affect our business. In the ordinary course of business, we develop intellectual property of many kinds that is or will be the subject of copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, trade secret, or other protections. Such intellectual property includes, but is not limited to, courseware materials for classes taught online and on-ground, and business know-how and internal processes and procedures developed to respond to the requirements of its various education regulatory agencies.\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. This fluctuation may result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. We experience, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenue. Historically, our quarterly revenues and income from U.S. operations have been lowest in the third quarter (July through September) because fewer students are enrolled during the summer months. ANZ's quarterly revenues and income from operations have been lowest in the first quarter (January through March) because fewer students are enrolled during the summer season in Australia and New Zealand. We also incur significant expenses in the third quarter in preparing for our peak enrollment in the U.S. in the fourth quarter (October through December), including investing in online and campus infrastructure necessary to support increased usage. These investments result in fluctuations in our operating results which could result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the online education market is a rapidly evolving market, and we may not be able to forecast accurately future enrollment growth and revenues.\nRegulatory requirements in the U.S. may make it more difficult to acquire us.\nA change in ownership resulting in a change of control of Strayer University or Capella University (or of the Company) would trigger a requirement for recertification of the University (or the Universities) by the Department of Education for purposes of participation in federal student financial aid programs, a review of the University\u2019s accreditation by its institutional accrediting agency, and reauthorization of the University (or the Universities) by certain state licensing and other regulatory agencies. If we or one of the Universities underwent a change of control that required approval by any state authority, any institutional accrediting agency, or any federal agency, and any required regulatory approval were significantly delayed, limited, or denied, there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to offer certain educational programs, award certain degrees, diplomas, or certificates, operate one or more of our locations, admit certain students or participate in Title IV programs, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business. These factors may diminish the Company\u2019s appeal as an acquisition target.\nCapacity constraints or system disruptions to a University\u2019s computer networks could damage the reputation of the institutions and limit our ability to attract and retain students.\nThe performance and reliability of our Universities\u2019 computer networks, especially the online educational platform, is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in traffic, could result in the unavailability of the University\u2019s computer networks. We cannot assure you that the Universities, including their online educational platforms, will be able to expand their program infrastructure on a timely basis sufficient to meet demand for their programs. The Universities\u2019 computer systems and operations could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond their control, including natural disasters and telecommunications failures. Any interruption to the Universities\u2019 computer systems or operations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students.\nThe Company\u2019s computer networks, and those of third parties we use in our operations, may be vulnerable to security risks that could disrupt operations and require them to expend significant resources.\nThe Company\u2019s computer networks, and those of third-parties we use in our operations, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, and other security problems, such as ransomware attacks, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. These systems may be subject to directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our students) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. These systems also may be vulnerable to disruptions from other factors, including pandemic, violent incident, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications and Internet failures, civil unrest, and other events beyond our reasonable control. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or disruptions to alleviate problems caused by these breaches or disruptions.\nThe Company has operations in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand, and is subject to complex business, economic, legal, political, geopolitical, and foreign currency risks, which risks may be difficult to address adequately.\nWith the acquisition of the ANZ portfolio, the Company now operates institutions in three different countries, each of which is subject to complex business, economic, legal, political, tax and foreign currency risks. We also contract with vendors who may have employees in various countries. We may have difficulty managing and administering an internationally dispersed business, which may materially adversely after our business, financial condition and results of operation. Additional challenges associated with the international conduct of the business that may materially adversely affect our operating results include:\n\u2022each of our institutions is subject to unique regulatory schemes, business challenges, and competitive pressures;\n\u2022difficulty maintaining quality standards consistent with our brands and with local accreditation standards;\n\u2022fluctuations in exchange rates, possible currency devaluations, inflation and hyperinflation;\n\u2022compliance with a variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022political elections and changes in government policies;\n\u2022potential economic, political, and geopolitical instability affecting the countries in which we and our vendors operate; and\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nThe personal information that the Company collects may be vulnerable to breach, theft, or loss that could adversely affect our reputation and operations and is subject to privacy and data security laws which may impact operational efficiency.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subject us to risks and costs that could harm our business. The Universities collect, use, and retain large amounts of personal information regarding their students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data, and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain vendors. Although we use security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, potentially resulting in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use, or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to various U.S. state and federal legislative and regulatory burdens that could, among other things, require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information. The risk of hacking and cyber-attacks has increased, as has the sophistication of such attacks, including ransomware attacks and email phishing schemes targeting employees to give up their credentials. We cannot assure you that a breach, loss, or theft of personal information will not occur. A breach, theft, or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under U.S. state and federal privacy statutes and legal actions by state authorities and private litigants, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides consumers with rights related to their personal information, likely applies to the Company. Were the CCPA to apply and if we were out of compliance, we could be subject to significant civil penalties or private lawsuits brought by consumers. Moreover, certain of our operations involve the collection of personal information from individuals outside the U.S., which may render us subject to global privacy and data security laws. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), Australia\u2019s Federal Privacy Act and Australian Privacy Principles and New Zealand\u2019s Privacy Act, may impact or restrict the manner in which the Company is able to transfer and process personal information. Further, were a U.S. state regulator or a foreign regulator to find the Company out of compliance with applicable privacy laws or regulations, there is the potential for administrative, civil, or criminal liability with significant monetary penalties as well as reputational harm to the Company.\nFailure to maintain adequate processes to prevent and detect fraudulent activity related to student online enrollment or financial aid could adversely affect the Universities\u2019 operations.\nOur online environment is susceptible to an increased risk of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to the student online learning platform and student financial aid programs. While we have been able to detect past incidents of fraudulent activity, which have been isolated, and we have increased our internal capabilities to prevent and detect possible fraudulent activity, we cannot be certain that our systems and processes will continue to be adequate with increasingly sophisticated external fraud schemes. The Department of Education requires institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the Office of the Inspector General any credible information related to fraudulent activity. If we do not maintain adequate systems to prevent and deter such fraudulent activity, the Department of Education may find a lack of \u201cadministrative capability\u201d and could limit our access to Title IV funding.\nIntegrating SEI and the recently acquired Torrens University and associated assets in Australia and New Zealand (\u201cANZ\u201d) may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the combined company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nThe success of the Company will depend on, among other things, our ability to integrate ANZ into SEI, in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing student relationships or adversely affect current revenues and investments in future growth. If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of ANZ may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Capella Education Company (\u201cCEC\u201d) and ANZ could become impaired in the future.\nWe are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. To the extent goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. Such a potential impairment charge could have a material impact on future operating results and statements of financial position of the Company.\nRisks Related to the Pandemic\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic and other possible future public health emergencies may adversely affect our business, our future results of operations, and our overall financial performance.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has caused significant volatility and disruption to the domestic and global economy. Like many other companies, to comply with government mandates and to protect the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff, and the communities in which we live, we have at times instituted a remote work policy for the vast majority of our workforce, closed most physical campus locations, and moved our on-ground courses at Strayer University, which comprised less than 5% of total seat count, to online-only instruction. The transition to remote working involves many operational challenges and may adversely affect our ability to satisfy student needs. Remote working may increase the chance of successful cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks and email phishing schemes targeting employees to give up their credentials. Preparing our offices and campuses in anticipation of a portion of our workforce returning to physical office and campus locations also presents operational challenges as on-site staff adjust to new equipment, new protocols, and hybrid combinations of on-site and remote work.\nIn addition, as the pandemic has continued, we have seen sustained weakness in demand, especially in the United States, where total average enrollment in our U.S. Higher Education segment decreased 11.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. Enrollment in ANZ also has been impacted by the pandemic and the related closure of international borders in Australia and New Zealand.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health emergencies will affect our business, operations and financial results is uncertain and will depend on numerous evolving factors that remain uncertain and are impossible to predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; the impact on economic activity from the pandemic and actions taken in response, including those of governmental entities; the impact of the pandemic and the government response thereto on our employees, students, and business partners, including any suspensions or terminations of employer tuition reimbursement programs; our ability to operate and provide our services with employees working remotely and/or closures of our campus locations; potential exposure to claims for liability arising out of employees or students who may contract the virus; and the ability of our students to continue their education notwithstanding the pandemic.\nCOVID-19 related regulatory and legislative changes may contain ambiguous provisions that could result in penalties in case of institutional noncompliance.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\u201cARP\u201d) and subsequent guidance from the Department of Education create several changes with regard to the administration of federal financial assistance programs. All of these changes include several ambiguities that make compliance difficult. In case of noncompliance, the Universities may face administrative sanctions, including penalties, Title IV program participation restrictions, debarment, and liabilities under applicable law, such as the False Claims Act, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are unable to predict whether Congress or the Department of Education plan to implement further changes related to federal financial assistance programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "PERMNO": 83799, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "STRA"}
