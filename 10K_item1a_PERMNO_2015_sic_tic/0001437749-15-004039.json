{"cik": "706874", "company": "PALMETTO BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-04", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe material risks and uncertainties that we believe impact the Company are described below. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted. If this were to happen, the value of our stock could decline, and investors could lose all or part of their investment. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur decisions regarding credit risk and allowance for loan losses may materially and adversely impact our business.\nMaking loans and other extensions of credit is an essential element of our business. Although we seek to mitigate risks inherent in lending by adhering to specific underwriting practices, our loans and other extensions of credit may not be repaid. The risk of nonpayment is impacted by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nThe duration of the credit,\n\u25cf\nCredit risks of a particular client,\n\u25cf\nThe quality of the underwriting,\n\u25cf\nChanges in economic and industry conditions and\n\u25cf\nIn the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nWe attempt to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses to provide for inherent losses in our loan portfolio. We periodically determine the amount of the allowance based on consideration of several factors, including:\n\u25cf\nEvaluations of the collectability of loans in our portfolio including consideration of factors such as the balance of impaired loans and the quality, mix and size of our overall loan portfolio,\n\u25cf\nEconomic conditions that may impact the overall loan portfolio or an individual borrower\u2019s ability to repay,\n\u25cf\nThe amount and quality of collateral securing the loans,\n\u25cf\nOur historical loan loss experience and\n\u25cf\nBorrower and collateral specific considerations for loans individually evaluated for impairment.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes subsequent to the determination of the allowance for loan losses. Therefore, we face the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed our allowance for loan losses, and that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will be required. Additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of our net income (or increase in our net loss) and possibly our capital.\nFederal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. Any increase in the amount of our provision for loan losses or loans charged-off as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have higher actual loan losses than our recorded allowance for loan losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that we believe is appropriate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Our actual loan losses could exceed our allowance for loan losses, and, therefore, our historic allowance for loan losses may not be adequate. As of December 31, 2014, 53.4% of our gross loan portfolio was secured by commercial real estate. Repayment of such loans is generally considered more subject to market risk than residential mortgage loans. Industry experience shows that a portion of loans will become delinquent, and that a portion of loans will require partial or entire charge-off. Regardless of the underwriting criteria utilized, losses may be experienced as a result of various factors beyond our control including, among other things, changes in market conditions impacting the value of loan collateral and problems impacting borrowers\u2019 credit.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is determined to be inadequate, we will be required to make additional provision for loan losses, which could further adversely impact our results of operations. No assurance can be given that we will not sustain credit losses requiring additions to the provision for loan losses in excess of present levels.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business.\nAt December 31, 2014, 79.7% of our gross loan portfolio was secured by real estate. The real estate collateral provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. The real estate market was substantially impacted by the Great Recession and its aftermath, which led to reduced real estate values for residential and commercial properties, increased levels of inventories of unsold homes and resulted in higher foreclosure rates. As a result, property values for this type of collateral declined substantially and, although stabilizing, some market appraisal assumptions remain depressed. These loans carry a higher degree of risk than long-term financing of existing real estate since repayment is dependent on the ultimate completion of the project or home and often on the sale of the property or permanent financing. Slower housing conditions have impacted some of these borrowers\u2019 ability to sell the completed projects in a timely manner. In some cases, this downturn resulted in a significant impairment in the value of the real estate collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. As a result, during 2009 through 2013, we incurred substantially higher charge-offs than we have historically experienced, and we maintained our allowance for loan losses during these periods at levels higher than historically maintained to address the probable credit losses inherent within our loan portfolio. Further deterioration in the South Carolina real estate market may cause us to adjust our opinion of the level of credit quality in our loan portfolio. Such a determination may lead to additional provisions for loan losses, which could also adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a concentration of credit exposure in commercial real estate and depressed commercial real estate conditions could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2014, 53.4% of our loan portfolio was secured by commercial real estate. Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally viewed as having more risk of default than loans secured by residential real estate or consumer loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property, the income stream of the borrowers, the accuracy of the estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction. Loans secured by commercial real estate are also generally more risky than loans secured by residential real estate or consumer loans because the collateral securing commercial real estate loans typically cannot be sold as easily as residential real estate. An adverse development with respect to one lending relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared with a single-family residential mortgage loan because we typically have more than one loan with such borrowers. Additionally, these loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared with single-family residential mortgage loans. Therefore, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant decline in the related asset quality. Because of the severity of the Great Recession and lack of a more typical recovery, these loans represent higher risk, could result in an increase in loans charged-off and could require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase our credit risk.\nMost of our commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle-market clients. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate negatively impact this important client sector, our financial condition, results of operations and the value of our common stock may be adversely impacted. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by us in recent years, and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Furthermore, the deterioration of our borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur underwriting decisions may materially and adversely impact our business.\nWhile we generally underwrite the loans in our portfolio in accordance with our own internal underwriting guidelines and regulatory supervisory guidelines, in certain circumstances, we have made loans, including purchased loans, with loan-to-value ratios which exceed either our internal underwriting guidelines, supervisory guidelines or both. The number of loans in our portfolio with loan-to-value ratios in excess of supervisory guidelines, our internal guidelines or both could increase the risk of delinquencies and defaults in our portfolio as well as credit losses.\nStrong competition within our market area could reduce our profits and slow growth.\nAs the economy continues to recover, we face more intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits, particularly as a community bank. This competition may make it more difficult for us to make new loans and may force us to offer lower loan rates and higher deposit rates. Pricing competition for loans and deposits might result in our earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which may reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits. Many of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area.\nThe severity of the Great Recession and lack of a typical recovery could reduce our client base, level of deposits and demand for financial products such as loans.\nOur success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in our markets. The Great Recession and its aftermath negatively impacted the markets in which we operate. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally do not continue to improve, our business may be negatively impacted. A period of depressed economic conditions or entering a prolonged recession would likely result in the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio, which in turn would hurt our business. Interest and fees on loans represented 89.5% and 90.1% of our interest income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. If economic conditions deteriorate or a prolonged economic recession occurs in the economy as a whole, borrowers will be less likely to repay their loans as scheduled. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures our loans may be adversely impacted by negative economic conditions. Unlike many larger institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Continued unfavorable economic conditions could, therefore, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLiquidity risks could impact operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nThe goal of liquidity management is to ensure that we can meet client loan requests, client deposit maturities and withdrawals and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this goal, our Asset / Liability Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) establishes liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid overdependence on volatile, less reliable funding sources.\nAn inability to raise funds through deposits, retail repurchase agreements, borrowings, the sale of securities or loans, issuance of additional equity or debt securities and other sources could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities and with terms acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that impact us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us such as disruptions in the financial markets and negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a result of contracting net interest margins, increased regulatory restrictions and costs and the lack of a robust economic recovery.\nHistorically, we have relied on deposits, retail repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, funding from correspondent banks and other borrowings to fund our operations. Some of the Bank\u2019s various sources of liquidity could be restricted in the event we experience negative financial performance.\nWe monitor the depository institutions that hold our federal funds sold and due from banks cash balances. We cannot provide assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents and federal funds sold will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal, and we diversify cash, due from banks and federal funds sold among counterparties to minimize exposure relating to any one of these entities. We routinely review the financial condition of our counterparties as part of our risk management process. Balances in our accounts with financial institutions in the U.S. may exceed the FDIC insurance limits. While we monitor and adjust the balances in our accounts as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if the correspondent financial institutions fail.\nWe currently do not utilize brokered deposits as a funding source. However, this funding source is available to us if we were to decide to pursue such funding. Brokered deposits generally represent deposit accounts placed with a bank from sources outside its local market. These funds are often raised at a cost in excess of the cost of funds generated through a bank\u2019s organic channels and do not represent true client relationships. Our ability to access the brokered deposit market without prior approval from the FDIC is contingent on maintaining a well-capitalized status under regulatory capital rules. Our ability to access the brokered deposit market can also be impacted by an FDIC order or other regulatory restrictions as a result of the Bank\u2019s ongoing examination process.\nThere can be no assurance that our sources of funds will be adequate for our liquidity needs, and we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future. Specifically, we may seek additional equity and/or debt in the future to achieve our business objectives. There can be no assurance that additional capital and/or borrowings, if sought, would be available to us or, if available, would be on favorable terms. Bank and holding company stock prices have been negatively impacted by the Great Recession and its aftermath as has the ability of banks and holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects could be materially adversely impacted.\nCustomers could pursue alternatives to bank deposits causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding.\nChecking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits could decrease if clients perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, provide superior expected returns. When customers move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments, we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, increasing our funding costs.\nNegative developments in the financial services industry, the domestic and international credit markets, and the economy in general pose significant challenges for our industry and us and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Great Recession and its aftermath resulted in unprecedented volatility and disruption in the financial markets and a general economic downturn, both nationally and in our primary market in the Upstate of South Carolina. As a result of this \u201ccredit crunch,\u201d commercial as well as consumer loan portfolio performance deteriorated at many institutions, and the competition for deposits and quality loans increased significantly. In addition, the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline. As a result, we face the following risks:\n\u25cf\nEconomic conditions that negatively impact housing prices and the job market may cause the credit quality of our loan portfolio to deteriorate,\n\u25cf\nMarket developments that impact consumer confidence may cause adverse changes in payment patterns by our clients, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities,\n\u25cf\nThe processes that we use to estimate our allowance for loan losses may no longer be reliable because they rely on judgments, such as forecasts of economic conditions, that may no longer be accurately estimated,\n\u25cf\nThe value of our securities portfolio may decline and\n\u25cf\nIncreased regulation of our industry, and the costs of compliance with such regulation may increase.\nThese conditions or similar ones may continue to persist or worsen causing us to experience continuing or increased adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely impact our financial condition.\nAs previously disclosed in Item 1. Business, the Bank\u2019s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain deposit insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, we are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.\nAlthough we cannot predict what the insurance assessment rates will be in the future, deterioration in our risk category could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in prevailing interest rates may reduce our profitability.\nOne of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk because:\n\u25cf\nAssets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times (for example, if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally falling, net income will initially decline),\n\u25cf\nAssets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts (for example, when the general level of interest rates is falling, we may reduce interest rates paid on deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the general decline in market interest rates),\n\u25cf\nShort-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts (for example, the shape of the yield curve may impact new or repricing loan yields and funding costs differently) and/or\n\u25cf\nThe remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change (for example, if long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply, mortgage-backed securities held in the investment securities available for sale portfolio may prepay significantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduce portfolio income).\nInterest rates may also have a direct or indirect impact on any of our financial instruments, including loan demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volumes, servicing rights, gain on the sale of mortgage and SBA loans, the value of our defined benefit pension plan (the \u201cPension Plan\u201d) assets and liabilities, bank-owned life insurance (\u201cBOLI\u201d) income, trading account income and other financial instruments directly or indirectly impacting net income.\nWe may be unable to anticipate changes in market interest rates, which are impacted by many factors beyond our control including, but not limited to, inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, monetary policy and other changes that impact financial markets both domestic and foreign. Our net interest income is impacted not only by the level and direction of interest rates but also by the shape of the yield curve and relationships between interest-sensitive instruments and key driver rates as well as balance sheet growth, client loan and deposit preferences and the timing of changes in these variables. In the event interest rates increase, our costs on interest-bearing liabilities may increase more rapidly than our income on interest-earning assets resulting in a deterioration of our net interest margin. As such, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Bank cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Bank. Any such losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on key management individuals and the loss of one or more of these key individuals could curtail our growth and adversely impact our prospects.\nWe depend on a limited number of key management personnel. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our operations because other personnel may not have the experience and expertise to readily replace these individuals. As a result, our Board of Directors may have to search outside of the Bank for qualified replacements. This search may be prolonged, and we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to locate and hire qualified replacements.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, have an adverse impact on our operations and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.\nWe operate in a highly-regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies. Our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities including payment of dividends, corporate transactions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of branches. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by our regulators, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth.\nFurther, changes in laws, regulations and regulatory practices impacting the financial services industry could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or may increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could also result in heightened regulatory scrutiny and in sanctions by regulatory agencies (such as a memorandum of understanding, a written supervisory agreement or a cease and desist order), civil money penalties and/or reputation damage. Any of these consequences could restrict our ability to expand our business or could require us to raise additional capital or sell assets on terms that are not advantageous to us or our shareholders and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, such violations may occur despite our best efforts.\nNew capital rules that were recently issued generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital. The impact of the new rules on our financial condition and operations is uncertain but could be materially adverse.\nOn July 9, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that will revise their risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by Basel III and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. This rule substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The requirements in the rule began to phase in on January 1, 2015 for the Company and the Bank. The requirements in the rule will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019.\nThe final rules increase capital requirements and generally include two new capital measurements that will impact us, a risk-based Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) ratio and a capital conservation buffer. CET1 capital is a subset of Tier 1 capital and is limited to common equity (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain other items. Other instruments that have historically qualified for Tier 1 treatment, including noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, are consigned to a category known as Additional Tier 1 capital and must be phased out over a period of nine years beginning in 2014. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets (such as us) to continue to include trust preferred securities and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital but not CET1. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that have historically been placed in Tier 2 as well as cumulative perpetual preferred stock.\nThe final rules adjust all three categories of capital by requiring new deductions from and adjustments to capital that will result in more stringent capital requirements and may require changes in the ways we do business. Among other things, the current rule on the deduction of mortgage-servicing assets from Tier 1 capital has been revised in ways that are likely to require a greater deduction than we currently make and that will require the deduction be made from CET1. This deduction phases in over a three-year period from 2015 through 2017. Additionally, any gains on sales of mortgage loans sold into securitizations must be deducted in full from CET1. This requirement phases in over three years from 2015 through 2017. Under the earlier rule and through 2014, no deduction is required.\nBeginning in 2015, our minimum capital requirements will be:\n\u25cf\nA CET1 ratio of 4.5%,\n\u25cf\nA Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% (up from 4%) and\n\u25cf\nA total capital ratio of 8% (the current requirement).\nOur leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4% level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years ultimately requiring 2.5% on top of the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements resulting in a required CET1 ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5% and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. While the final rules will result in higher regulatory capital standards, it is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards will ultimately be applied to us.\nIn addition to the higher required capital ratios and the new deductions and adjustments, the final rules increase the risk-weights for certain assets. As a result, we will have to hold more capital against these assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150% rather than the current 100%. There are also new risk-weights for unsettled transactions and derivatives. We also will be required to hold capital against short-term commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable. Prior to January 1, 2015, there were no capital requirements for these off-balance sheet commitments. All changes to the risk-weights take effect fully in 2015.\nIn addition, in the current economic and regulatory environment, bank regulators may impose capital requirements that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations. The application of more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk-weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying our business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions including paying dividends or buying back shares of our stock.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 and other laws and regulations require financial institutions to, among other duties, institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. During 2013 and 2014, the CFPB issued several rules on mortgage lending, notably a rule requiring all home mortgage lenders to determine a borrower's ability to repay the loan. Loans with certain terms and conditions and that otherwise meet the definition of a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d may be protected from liability to a borrower for failing to make the necessary determinations. In either case, we may find it necessary to tighten our mortgage loan underwriting standards in response to the CFPB rules, which may constrain our ability to make loans consistent with our business strategies. It is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers' ability to repay, but the law and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. Additionally, they increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average interest rate charged or the points and fees charged on loans that we do originate.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the CRA and result in a wide variety of sanctions including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, any of which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to our Bank if the Bank experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it, and, therefore, we may be required to borrow funds. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company's general unsecured creditors including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and would adversely impact the holding company's prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDeteriorating sovereign debt conditions, including in the U.S., could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns, coupled with signs of deteriorating sovereign debt conditions in Europe, have increased the possibility of additional credit rating downgrades and economic slowdowns in the U.S. Although U.S. lawmakers passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling in 2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. from AAA to AA+ in August 2011. The impact of any further downgrades to the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely impact the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions. The U.S. government has adopted legislation to suspend the debt limit numerous times since January 2013. Currently, the debt ceiling is suspended without conditions through March 15, 2015. Moody's and Fitch have each warned that they may downgrade the U.S. government's rating if the federal debt is not stabilized. A downgrade of the U.S. government's credit rating or a default by the U.S. government to satisfy its debt obligations likely would create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which would weigh heavily on the global banking system. It is possible that any such impact could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we grow in the future or incur additional credit losses, we may need to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. If we grow in the future or incur additional credit losses, we may need to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend, in part, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed, our ability to expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, existing shareholder interests could be diluted.\nWe may evaluate, and potentially consummate, strategic transactions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, and adversely affect our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may, from time to time, seek out or be presented with opportunities to engage in a capital raising transaction or transactions, or to acquire or be acquired by, or merge with, another bank or other third party. Such strategic transactions may also create uncertainty for our teammates, clients and business partners. Any such uncertainty could make it more difficult for us to retain key teammates and hire new talent, and could cause our clients and business partners to not enter into new arrangements with us or to terminate existing arrangements which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, management and our board of directors could be subject to future lawsuits related to strategic transactions. Any such future lawsuits could become time consuming and expensive.\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technologies, and, as a result, we are subject to various cybersecurity risks.\nCybersecurity refers to the combination of technologies, processes and procedures established to protect information technology systems and data from unauthorized access, attack or damage. Our business involves the storage and transmission of clients\u2019 personal information. While we have internal policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, as well as contracts and service agreements with applicable outside vendors, we cannot be assured that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do, that they will be addressed adequately. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client information, whether through a breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm our business. Although we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches, cyber incidents and other security threats, our facilities and systems, and those of third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human error, or other similar events that could have a material adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, the storage and transmission of such data is regulated at the federal and state level. Privacy information security laws and regulation changes, and compliance therewith, may result in cost increases due to system changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or experience a data security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subject to fines, penalties, administrative orders and other legal risks as a result of a breach or non-compliance.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our deferred tax asset is impaired in the future, our earnings and capital position may be adversely impacted.\nDeferred income tax represents the tax impact of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by us to determine if they are realizable. Factors used in this assessment include our ability to carryback or carryforward net operating losses, the performance of the business including our ability to generate taxable income from a variety of sources and the impact of tax planning strategies. If, based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset must be established with a corresponding charge to income tax expense.\nThe Private Placement was considered a change in control under the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations. Accordingly, the Company was required to evaluate potential limitation or deferral of our ability to carryforward pre-acquisition net operating losses and to determine the amount of net unrealized pre-acquisition built-in losses that also are subject to similar limitation or deferral. Under the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations, net unrealized pre-acquisition built-in losses realized within five years of the change in control on October 7, 2010 are subject to potential limitation. Through that date, we will continue to analyze our ability to utilize such losses to offset anticipated future taxable income as pre-acquisition built-in losses are ultimately realized.\nAnalysis of our ability to realize deferred tax assets requires us to apply significant judgment and is inherently subjective because the future occurrence of events and circumstances cannot be predicted with certainty. The net operating losses and realized built-in losses generated in 2010, 2011 and 2012 may be carried forward for income tax purposes up to 20 years. Thus, to the extent we generate sufficient taxable income in the future, we may be able to utilize the net operating losses and realized built-in losses for income tax purposes. The determination of how much of the net operating losses and realized built-in losses we expect to ultimately utilize, and the resulting recognition of these tax benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is based on sustained trends in our profitability and the projected utilization of deferred tax assets.\nWe are party to various lawsuits incidental to our business. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties such that the expenses and ultimate exposure with respect to many of these matters cannot be ascertained.\nFrom time to time, clients and others make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of fiduciary responsibilities. Whether client claims and other legal actions are legitimate or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely impact the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse impact on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock could be restricted.\nThe Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve\u2019s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks when necessary. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could impact our ability to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nSince the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and does not conduct stand-alone operations, its ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to it. As a South Carolina chartered bank, the Bank is subject to limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay. Unless otherwise instructed by the State Board or the Commissioner of Banking, the Bank is generally permitted under South Carolina state banking regulations to pay cash dividends of up to 100% of net income in any calendar year without obtaining the prior approval of the State Board.\nIn addition, under Federal Reserve regulations, a dividend cannot be paid by the Bank if it would be less than well-capitalized after the dividend. The Federal Reserve may also prevent the payment of a dividend by the Bank if it determines that the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.\nWe may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock, which may dilute the interests of our shareholders and may adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\nWe are currently authorized to issue up to 75,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 12,814,574 shares were outstanding as of February 23, 2015, and up to 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which were outstanding as of February 23, 2015. In addition, in 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to provide capacity and flexibility for the Company\u2019s possible future funding needs. The registration statement allows the Company to issue a variety of registered debt and/or equity securities of up to $50 million; however there are currently no plans to access such funding. We may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future to strengthen our capital position or to make strategic acquisitions or investments. If we determine, for any reason, that we need to raise capital, our Board of Directors generally has the authority, without action by or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of stock for any corporate purpose including issuance of equity-based incentives under our equity compensation plans, subject to applicable NASDAQ Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) rules. Additionally, we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. Any issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in losses to our investors and litigation against us.\nOur stock price may be volatile and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nActual or anticipated variations in earnings,\n\u25cf\nInitiation of coverage by analysts and their resulting recommendations or projections,\n\u25cf\nOur announcement of developments related to our businesses,\n\u25cf\nPotential or consummated corporate transactions, including mergers and acquisitions and securities offerings,\n\u25cf\nOperations and stock performance of other financial institutions,\n\u25cf\nNew technology used or services offered by traditional and nontraditional competitors,\n\u25cf\nNews reports of trends, concerns or irrational exuberance on the part of investors,\n\u25cf\nChanges in economic conditions,\n\u25cf\nGeneral equity market conditions,\n\u25cf\nTrading volume,\n\u25cf\nContinued listing on the NASDAQ and inclusion in the Russell 2000(R) Index, and/or\n\u25cf\nOther issues related to the financial services industry.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, could adversely impact the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for our investors to sell their common stock when they desire and at prices they find attractive. Moreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. We could, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from normal business.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for shareholders to resell our common stock at times or at prices they find attractive.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ, our stock price constantly changes, and we expect our stock price to continue to fluctuate in the future. Our stock price is impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf\nVariations in our operating results or the quality of our assets,\n\u25cf\nOperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors,\n\u25cf\nIncrease in loan losses, nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate,\n\u25cf\nChanges in expectations as to our future financial performance,\n\u25cf\nAnnouncements of new products, strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors,\n\u25cf\nThe operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us,\n\u25cf\nOur common stock listed on the small-cap Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the possibility that our common stock is removed from the Index,\n\u25cf\nActual or anticipated sales of our equity or equity-related securities,\n\u25cf\nOur past and future dividend practice,\n\u25cf\nOur creditworthiness,\n\u25cf\nInterest rates,\n\u25cf\nThe credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing,\n\u25cf\nDevelopments with respect to financial institutions generally and\n\u25cf\nEconomic, financial, geopolitical, regulatory, congressional or judicial events that impact us or the financial markets.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has recently experienced price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies and particularly those in the financial services and banking sector including for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely impact our stock price, notwithstanding our operating results.\nFuture sales of our stock by our shareholders, or the perception that those sales could occur, may cause our stock price to decline.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ, the trading volume in our common stock is generally lower than that of other financial services companies of equal or greater size. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. The relatively low trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock in the public market or the perception that those sales may occur could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions.\nOur common stock is owned by one or more larger shareholders whose interests may conflict with those of our other shareholders.\nCapGen Financial Partners (\u201cCapGen\u201d) and its affiliates and Patriot Financial Partners (\u201cPatriot\u201d) and its affiliates own approximately 44.7% and 19.1%, respectively, of our outstanding shares of common stock as of February 23, 2015. As a result, CapGen and Patriot are able, individually and collectively, to exercise significant influence on our business as shareholders including influence over election of our Board of Directors and the authorization of other corporate actions requiring shareholder approval. In deciding on how to vote on certain proposals, our shareholders should be aware that CapGen and Patriot may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our other shareholders.\nA holder with as little as a 5% interest in our Company could, under certain circumstances, be subject to regulation as a \u201cbank holding company\u201d and possibly other restrictions.\nAny entity (including a \u201cgroup\u201d composed of natural persons) owning 25% or more of our outstanding common stock, or 5% or more if such holder otherwise exercises a \u201ccontrolling influence\u201d over us, may be subject to regulation as a bank holding company in accordance with the BHCA. In addition any bank holding company or foreign bank with a U.S. presence may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA to acquire or retain 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and any person other than a bank holding company may be required to obtain regulatory approval under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 to acquire or retain 10% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nBecoming a bank holding company imposes certain statutory and regulatory restrictions and burdens and might require the holder to divest all or a portion of the holder\u2019s investment in our common stock. In addition, because a bank holding company is required to provide managerial and financial strength for its bank subsidiary, such a holder may be required to divest investments that may be deemed incompatible with bank holding company status such as a material investment in a company unrelated to banking. Further, subject to an FDIC policy statement published in August 2009, under certain circumstances, holders of 5% or more of our securities could be required to be subject to certain restrictions such as an inability to sell or trade their securities for a period of three years, among other restrictions, in order for us to participate in an FDIC-assisted transaction of a failed bank. Given their ownership percentage of our common stock, CapGen is deemed by the Federal Reserve to be the top-tier bank holding company for the Company.", "PERMNO": 12967, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PLMT"}
