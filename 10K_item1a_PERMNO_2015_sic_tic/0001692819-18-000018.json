{"cik": "1692819", "company": "Vistra Energy Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nImportant factors, in addition to others specifically addressed in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that could have a material adverse effect on the Merger and/or our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, or could cause results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statement in this Annual Report, are described below. There may be further risks and uncertainties that are not currently known or that are not currently believed to be material that may adversely affect the Merger and/or our business, results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and prospects and the market price of our common stock in the future. The realization of any of these factors could cause investors in our common stock to lose all or a substantial portion of their investment.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe Merger is subject to a number of conditions which, if not satisfied or waived in a timely manner, would delay the Merger or adversely impact our ability to complete the Merger on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or at all.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. For example, before the Merger may be completed, both our stockholders and Dynegy stockholders must approve the Merger Proposal. In addition, various filings must be made with the FERC and certain other regulatory, antitrust and other authorities in the U.S., including the PUCT, the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These governmental authorities may impose conditions on the completion, or require changes to the terms of the Merger, including restrictions or conditions on the business, operations or financial performance of the combined company following completion of the Merger. These conditions or changes, including potential litigation brought in connection with the Merger, could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger, or could cause the combined company not to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the combined company and/or cause either Vistra Energy or Dynegy to abandon the Merger. These conditions or changes could also have the effect of causing the Merger to be consummated on terms different than those contemplated by the Merger Agreement or causing the Merger to fail to be consummated.\nIf we are unable to complete the Merger, we still will incur and will remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting, filing, printing and other costs relating to the Merger. Also, depending upon the reasons for not completing the Merger, we may be required to pay Dynegy a termination fee of $100 million or reimburse its expenses up to $22 million. For more information on the termination fees and/or expenses potentially payable by the Company and Dynegy, see Note 2 to the Financial Statements. If such a termination fee is payable, the payment of this fee could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.\nFailure to consummate the Merger as currently contemplated or at all could adversely affect the price of our common stock and our future business and financial results.\nThe completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. We cannot guarantee when or if these conditions will be satisfied or that the Merger will be successfully completed. If the Merger is not consummated, or is consummated on different terms than as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, we could be adversely affected and subject to a variety of risks associated with the failure to consummate the Merger, or to consummate the Merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including:\n\u2022\nour stockholders may be prevented from realizing the anticipated potential benefits of the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe market price of our common stock could decline significantly;\n\u2022\nreputational harm due to the adverse public perception of any failure to successfully complete the Merger;\n\u2022\nunder certain circumstances, we may be required to pay Dynegy a termination fee of up to $100 million or reimburse its expenses up to $22 million, and\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management and employees may be diverted from their day-to-day business and operational matters and our relationships with our customers and suppliers may be disrupted as a result of efforts relating to attempting to consummate the Merger.\nAny delay in the consummation of the Merger, any uncertainty about the consummation of the Merger on terms other than those contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any failure to consummate the Merger could adversely affect our business, financial results and common stock price.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending that could adversely affect our financial results.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on our business. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships.\nIf, despite our retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or prospective employees fail to accept employment with us for any reason, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, our operations and financial results could be affected.\nThe pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration of Dynegy may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect our business, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we are restricted under the Merger Agreement, without obtaining Dynegy's consent, from taking other specified actions until the Merger occurs or the Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nBecause the market prices of shares of common stock of the Company and Dynegy will fluctuate and the Exchange Ratio is fixed, the market value of the merger consideration at the date of the closing may vary significantly from the date the Merger Agreement was executed, the date of the joint proxy statement and prospectus and the dates of our special meeting and Dynegy's special meeting.\nUpon completion of the Merger, subject to certain exceptions, each outstanding share of Dynegy common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.652 of a share of common stock of the Company. The number of shares of common stock of the Company to be issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement for each share of Dynegy common stock is fixed and will not change to reflect changes in the market price of common stock of the Company or Dynegy. Because the Exchange Ratio is fixed, the market value of the common stock of the Company issued in connection with the Merger and/or the Dynegy common stock surrendered in connection with the Merger may be significantly higher or lower than the values of those shares on the date the Merger Agreement was signed, the date of the joint proxy statement and prospectus, the dates of our special meeting and Dynegy's special meeting to consider the Merger Proposal or other earlier dates. Stock price changes may result from market assessment of the likelihood that the Merger will be completed, changes in the business, operations or prospects of the Company or Dynegy prior to or following the Merger, litigation or regulatory considerations, general business, market, industry or economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of the Company and Dynegy. Neither the Company nor Dynegy is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement because of changes in the market price of either company's common stock.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit the Company's ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, which could discourage a potential competing acquirer of the Company from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in certain circumstances, could require the Company to pay a termination fee to Dynegy.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Company is restricted from entering into alternative transactions to the Merger. Unless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, the Company is restricted from soliciting, initiating, seeking or knowingly encouraging or facilitating, or engaging in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, any alternative proposal or any inquiry, proposal or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative proposal. While our board of directors (Board) is permitted to change its recommendation to stockholders prior to the applicable special meeting under certain circumstances, namely if we are is in receipt of an unsolicited superior proposal or a certain unforeseeable, material intervening event has occurred, before the Board changes its recommendation to stockholders, it must give Dynegy the opportunity to make a revised proposal. The Company may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to an unsolicited superior proposal only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including compliance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement restricting solicitation of alternative proposals and requiring payment of a termination fee in certain circumstances. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing such an acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the Merger, or could result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it would otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances. As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction without incurring potentially significant liabilities in respect of the Merger.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated because our Board changes its recommendation to stockholders or the Company enters into a definitive agreement for an unsolicited superior proposal, the Company will be required to pay Dynegy a termination fee of $100 million. For more information on the termination fees and/or expenses potentially payable by the Company, see Note 2 to the Financial Statements. If such a termination fee is payable, the payment of this fee could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company.\nCommon stock holders of the Company will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the combined company after the Merger and will exercise less influence over management of the combined company.\nUpon completion of the Merger, continuing holders of common stock of the Company are expected to own 79% of the combined company's fully diluted equity. Stockholders of the Company currently have the right to vote for the Board and on other matters affecting the Company. When the Merger occurs, each Dynegy stockholder will receive 0.652 shares of common stock of the Company per share of Dynegy common stock, resulting in a percentage ownership of the combined company by each continuing holder of common stock of the Company that is smaller than the stockholder's percentage ownership of the Company prior to the Merger. As a result of these reduced ownership percentages, current stockholders of the Company may have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have with respect to the Company on a standalone basis.\nThe Merger will result in changes to the board of directors that may affect the strategy and operations of the combined company.\nIn connection with the consummation of the Merger, the board of directors of the combined company will consist of eleven members, which is expected to be comprised of all eight members of our Board and three members from the board of directors of Dynegy (provided such directors are willing to serve on the board of the combined company). This new composition of the board of directors may affect the combined company's business strategy and operating decisions following the completion of the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not consummated by April 29,2019, the Company or Dynegy may terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances.\nEither the Company or Dynegy may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including, if the Merger has not been consummated by April 29, 2019, unless extended pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. However, this termination right will not be available to a party if that party failed to perform or comply in all material respects with its obligations under the Merger Agreement and that failure was the principal cause of the failure to consummate the Merger by such date.\nAn adverse judgment in any litigation challenging the Merger may prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.\nIt is possible that our stockholders or Dynegy stockholders may file lawsuits challenging the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, which may name the Company, our Board, Dynegy and/or the Dynegy board of directors as defendants. The outcome of such lawsuits cannot be assured, including the amount of costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of these claims. If plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the Merger on the agreed-upon terms, such an injunction may delay the consummation of the Merger in the expected timeframe, or may prevent the Merger from being consummated altogether. Whether or not any plaintiff's claim is successful, this type of litigation may result in significant costs and divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of our business.\nFollowing the Merger, the combined company may be unable to integrate our business and Dynegy's business successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and other expected benefits of the Merger on the anticipated timeframe or at all.\nThe Merger involves the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent public companies. The combined company expects to benefit from certain cost savings and operating efficiencies, some of which will take time to realize. The combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to the integration of our and Dynegy's business practices and operations. The potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully combine our and Dynegy's businesses in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the Merger, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Merger not being realized in the timeframe currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nthe complexities associated with integrating personnel from the two companies;\n\u2022\nthe complexities of combining two companies with different histories, geographic footprints and asset mixes;\n\u2022\nthe complexities in combining two companies with separate technology systems;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or conditions associated with the Merger;\n\u2022\nfailure to perform by third-party service providers who provide key services for the combined company, and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by completing the Merger and integrating the companies' operations.\nFor all these reasons, it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of the combined company's management, the disruption of the combined company's ongoing business or inconsistencies in its operations, services, standards, controls, policies and procedures, any of which could adversely affect the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with operators, vendors and employees, to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger, or could otherwise materially and adversely affect its business and financial results.\nThe Merger will combine two companies that are currently affected by developments in the electric utility industry, including changes in regulation and increased competition. A failure to adapt to the changing regulatory environment after the Merger could adversely affect the stability of the combined company's earnings and could result in the erosion of its market positions, revenues and profits.\nBecause the Company, Dynegy and their respective subsidiaries are regulated in the U.S. at the federal level and in several states, the two companies have been and will continue to be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. After the Merger, the combined company and/or its subsidiaries will be subject in the U.S. to extensive federal regulation as well as to state regulation in the states in which the combined company will operate. The costs and burdens associated with complying with these regulatory jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on the combined company. Moreover, potential legislative changes, regulatory changes or otherwise may create greater risks to the stability of the combined company's earnings generally. If the combined company is not responsive to these changes, it could suffer erosion in market position, revenues and profits as competitors gain access to its service territories.\nCertain directors and executive officers of the Company have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other stockholders of the Company, which could have influenced their decisions to support or approve the Merger.\nStockholders of the Company should recognize that certain directors and executive officers of the Company have interests in the Merger that differ from, or that are in addition to, their interests as stockholders of the Company. These interests include, among others, continued service as a director or an executive officer of the combined company, the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards and/or severance benefits as a result of termination of employment in connection with the Merger. These interests, among others, may influence the directors and executive officers of the Company to approve and/or recommend Merger-related proposals. Our Board was aware of and considered these interests at the time it approved the Merger Agreement.\nThe combined company will have a significant amount of indebtedness. As a result, it may be more difficult for the combined company to pay or refinance its debts or take other actions, and the combined company may need to divert its cash flow from operations to debt service payments.\nThe combined company will have significant indebtedness following completion of the Merger. In addition, subject to the limits contained in the documents governing such indebtedness, the combined company may be able to incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If the combined company does so, the risks related to its high level of debt could intensify. The amount of such indebtedness could have material adverse consequences for the combined company, including:\n\u2022\nhindering its ability to adjust to changing market, industry or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting its ability to access the capital markets to raise additional equity or refinance maturing debt on favorable terms or to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or emerging businesses or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting the amount of free cash flow available for future operations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases or other uses;\n\u2022\nmaking it more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases, and\n\u2022\nplacing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors.\nMoreover, to respond to competitive challenges, the combined company may be required to raise significant additional capital to execute its business strategy. The combined company's ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, its financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond its control. Even if the combined company is able to obtain additional financing, its credit ratings could be adversely affected, which could raise its borrowing costs and limit its future access to capital and its ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness.\nThe terms of the credit agreements governing the combined company's two separate credit facilities will restrict its current and future operations, particularly the combined company's ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe combined company is expected to operate under two separate credit facilities, each with its own set of restrictive covenants. These restrictive covenants may limit the combined company's ability to engage in acts that may be in the combined company's long-term best interest, including restrictions on its ability to enter into intercompany business and financial transactions and arrangements, and therefore may prevent the combined company from fully realizing the potential benefits of the Merger. Additionally, the combined company's ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in its debt instruments may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond its control.\nA breach of the covenants and restrictions under the credit agreements governing the combined company's credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. If the combined company experiences such a default, it may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of its existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. The combined company may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow the combined company to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. As a result of these restrictions, the combined company may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how it conducts its business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect the combined company's ability to grow in accordance with its strategy. In addition, the combined company's financial results, its significant indebtedness and credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of its financing.\nThe combined company is expected to incur significant expenses related to the Merger and the integration of the Company and Dynegy.\nThe combined company is expected to incur significant expenses in connection with the Merger and the integration of the Company and Dynegy. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems at each company that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, revenue management, commercial operations, risk management, marketing and employee benefits. While the Company and Dynegy have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, there are many factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. These integration expenses likely will result in the combined company taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the Merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.\nMarket, Financial and Economic Risks\nOur revenues, results of operations and operating cash flows generally may be impacted by price fluctuations in the wholesale power and natural gas, coal and oil markets and other market factors beyond our control.\nWe are not guaranteed any rate of return on capital investments in our businesses. We conduct integrated power generation and retail electricity activities, focusing on power generation, wholesale electricity sales and purchases, retail sales of electricity and services to end users and commodity risk management. Our wholesale and retail businesses are to some extent countercyclical in nature, particularly for the wholesale power and ancillary services supplied to the retail business. However, we do have a wholesale power position that exceeds the overall load requirements of our retail business and is subject to wholesale power price moves. As a result, our revenues, results of operations and operating cash flows depend in large part upon wholesale market prices for electricity, natural gas, uranium, lignite, coal, fuel and transportation in our regional market and other competitive markets and upon prevailing retail electricity rates, which may be impacted by, among other things, actions of regulatory authorities. Market prices for power, capacity, ancillary services, natural gas, coal and oil are unpredictable and may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time. Unlike most other commodities, electric power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power prices are subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand imbalances, especially in the day-ahead and spot markets. Demand for electricity can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. Over-supply can also occur as a result of the construction of new power plants, as we have observed in recent years. During periods of over-supply, electricity prices might be depressed. Also, at times there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets.\nSome of the fuel for our generation facilities is purchased under short-term contracts. Fuel costs (including diesel, natural gas, lignite, coal and nuclear fuel) may be volatile, and the wholesale price for electricity may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel costs. In addition, we purchase and sell natural gas and other energy related commodities, and volatility in these markets may affect costs incurred in meeting obligations.\nVolatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from, among other factors:\n\u2022\nvolatility in commodity prices and the supply of commodities, including but not limited to natural gas, coal and oil;\n\u2022\nvolatility in ERCOT market heat rates;\n\u2022\nvolatility in coal and rail transportation prices;\n\u2022\nfuel transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;\n\u2022\nvolatility in nuclear fuel and related enrichment and conversion services;\n\u2022\nsevere or unexpected weather conditions, including drought and limitations on access to water;\n\u2022\nseasonality;\n\u2022\nchanges in electricity and fuel usage resulting from conservation efforts, changes in technology or other factors;\n\u2022\nilliquidity in the wholesale electricity or other commodity markets;\n\u2022\ntransmission or transportation disruptions, constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies, or other changes in power transmission infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndevelopment and availability of new fuels, new technologies and new forms of competition for the production and storage of power, including competitively priced alternative energy sources or storage;\n\u2022\nchanges in market structure and liquidity;\n\u2022\nchanges in the manner in which we operate our facilities, including curtailed operation due to market pricing, environmental regulations and legislation, safety or other factors;\n\u2022\nchanges in generation efficiency;\n\u2022\noutages or otherwise reduced output from our generation facilities or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in electric capacity, including the addition of new supplies of power as a result of the development of new plants, expansion of existing plants, the continued operation of uneconomic power plants due to federal, state or local subsidies, or additional transmission capacity;\n\u2022\nour creditworthiness and liquidity and the willingness of fuel suppliers and transporters to do business with us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the credit risk or payment practices of market participants;\n\u2022\nchanges in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal, uranium, diesel and other refined products;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, wars, sabotage, terrorist acts, embargoes and other catastrophic events, and\n\u2022\nchanges in law, including judicial decisions, federal, state and local energy, environmental and other regulation and legislation.\nAll of our generation facilities are currently located in the ERCOT market, a market with limited interconnections to other markets. The price of electricity in the ERCOT market is typically set by natural gas-fueled generation facilities, with wholesale electricity prices generally tracking increases or decreases in the price of natural gas. A substantial portion of our supply volumes in 2016 and 2017 were produced by our nuclear-, lignite- and coal-fueled generation assets. Natural gas prices have generally trended downward since mid-2008 (from $11.12 per MMBtu in mid- 2008 to $3.11 per MMBtu for the average settled price for the year ended December 31, 2017). Furthermore, in recent years, natural gas supply has outpaced demand primarily as a result of development and expansion of hydraulic fracturing in natural gas extraction, and the supply/demand imbalance has resulted in historically low natural gas prices. Because our baseload generating units and a substantial portion of our load following generating units are nuclear-, lignite- and coal-fueled, our results of operations and operating cash flows have been negatively impacted by the effect of low natural gas prices on wholesale electricity prices without a significant decrease in our operating cost inputs. Various industry experts expect this supply/demand imbalance to persist for a number of years, thereby depressing natural gas prices for a long-term period. As a result, the financial results from, and the value of, our generation assets could remain depressed or could materially decrease in the future unless natural gas prices rebound materially.\nWholesale electricity prices also track ERCOT market heat rates, which can be affected by a number of factors, including generation availability and the efficiency of the marginal supplier (generally natural gas-fueled generation facilities) in generating electricity. Our market heat rate exposure is impacted by changes in the availability of generating resources, such as additions and retirements of generation facilities, and the mix of generation assets in ERCOT. For example, increasing renewable (wind and solar) generation capacity generally depresses market heat rates. Additionally, construction of more efficient generation capacity also depresses market heat rates. Decreases in market heat rates decrease the value of all of our generation assets because lower market heat rates generally result in lower wholesale electricity prices. Even though market heat rates have generally increased over the past several years, wholesale electricity prices have declined due to the greater effect of falling natural gas prices. As a result, the financial results from, and the value of, our nuclear-, lignite- and coal-fueled generation assets could significantly decrease in profitability and value and our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted if ERCOT market heat rates decline.\nWe recently announced the retirement of our Monticello, Sandow 4, Sandow 5 and Big Brown units. A sustained decrease in the financial results from, or the value of, our generation units ultimately could result in the retirement or idling of certain other generation units. In recent years, we have operated certain of our lignite- and coal-fueled generation assets only during parts of the year that have higher electricity demand and, therefore, higher related wholesale electricity prices.\nOur assets or positions cannot be fully hedged against changes in commodity prices and market heat rates, and hedging transactions may not work as planned or hedge counterparties may default on their obligations.\nOur hedging activities do not fully protect us against the risks associated with changes in commodity prices, most notably electricity and natural gas prices, because of the expected useful life of our generation assets and the size of our position relative to the duration of available markets for various hedging activities. Generally, commodity markets that we participate in to hedge our exposure to ERCOT electricity prices and heat rates have limited liquidity after two to three years. Further, our ability to hedge our revenues by utilizing cross-commodity hedging strategies with natural gas hedging instruments is generally limited to a duration of four to five years. To the extent we have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices and/or market heat rates can materially impact our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition, either favorably or unfavorably.\nTo manage our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, we routinely enter into contracts to hedge portions of purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements and inventories of natural gas, lignite, coal, diesel fuel, uranium and refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed-price forward physical purchase and sale contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. Although we devote a considerable amount of time and effort to the establishment of risk management procedures, as well as the ongoing review of the implementation of these procedures, the procedures in place may not always function as planned and cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. For example, we hedge the expected needs of our wholesale and retail customers, but unexpected changes due to weather, natural disasters, consumer behavior, market constraints or other factors could cause us to purchase electricity to meet unexpected demand in periods of high wholesale market prices or resell excess electricity into the wholesale market in periods of low prices. As a result of these and other factors, risk management decisions may have a material adverse effect on us.\nBased on economic and other considerations, we may not be able to, or we may decide not to, hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price risk. To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price risk and applicable commodity prices change in ways adverse to us, we could be materially and adversely affected. To the extent we do hedge against commodity price risk, those hedges may ultimately prove to be ineffective.\nWith the tightening of credit markets that began in 2008 and the expansion of regulatory oversight through various financial reforms, there has been a decline in the number of market participants in the wholesale energy commodities markets, resulting in less liquidity, particularly in the ERCOT electricity market. Notably, participation by financial institutions and other intermediaries (including investment banks) in such markets has declined. Extended declines in market liquidity could adversely affect our ability to hedge our financial exposure to desired levels.\nTo the extent we engage in hedging and risk management activities, we are exposed to the credit risk that counterparties that owe us money, energy or other commodities as a result of these activities will not perform their obligations to us. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we could be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor the underlying commitment at then-current market prices. Additionally, our counterparties may seek bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 or liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Our credit risk may be exacerbated to the extent collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of our financial assets would not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In such event, we could incur losses or forgo expected gains in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. ERCOT market participants are also exposed to risks that another ERCOT market participant may default on its obligations to pay ERCOT for electricity or services taken, in which case such costs, to the extent not offset by posted security and other protections available to ERCOT, may be allocated to various non-defaulting ERCOT market participants, including us.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if energy market participants continue to construct additional generation facilities (i.e., new-build) or expand or enhance existing generation facilities in ERCOT despite relatively low power prices in ERCOT and such additional generation capacity results in a reduction in wholesale power prices.\nGiven the overall attractiveness of ERCOT and certain tax benefits associated with renewable energy, among other matters, energy market participants have continued to construct new generation facilities (i.e., new-build) or invest in enhancements or expansions of existing generation facilities in ERCOT despite relatively low wholesale power prices. If this market dynamic continues, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if such additional generation capacity results in an over-supply of electricity in ERCOT that causes a reduction in wholesale power prices in ERCOT.\nUnauthorized hedging and related activities by our employees could result in significant losses.\nWe have various internal policies, processes, and controls designed to monitor hedging activities and positions. These policies, processes, and controls are designed, in part, to prevent unauthorized purchases or sales of products by our employees or alert our risk management teams of any trades that have not been entered into our risk management systems. We cannot assure, however, that these steps will detect and prevent inaccurate reporting and all potential violations of our risk management policies, processes, and controls, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved. A significant policy violation that is not detected could result in a substantial financial loss.\nOur risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the risk associated with our commodity hedging activities.\nOur operations and other commodity hedging activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements. We attempt to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management policies and procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. As a result, we cannot fully predict the impact that our commodity hedging activities and risk management decisions may have on our business and/or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic downturns would likely have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nOur results of operations may be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy, including low levels in the market prices for power, generation capacity and natural gas, which can fluctuate substantially. Increased unemployment of residential customers and decreased demand for products and services by commercial and industrial customers resulting from an economic downturn could lead to declines in the demand for energy and an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances, which would negatively impact our overall sales and cash flows. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write down the carrying value of certain assets to their respective fair values.\nOur liquidity needs could be difficult to satisfy, particularly during times of uncertainty in the financial markets or during times of significant fluctuation in commodity prices, and we may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We currently maintain non-investment grade credit ratings that could negatively affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms or result in higher collateral requirements, particularly if our credit ratings were to be downgraded in the future.\nOur businesses are capital intensive. In general, we rely on access to financial markets and credit facilities as a significant source of liquidity for our capital requirements and other obligations not satisfied by cash-on-hand or operating cash flows. The inability to raise capital or to access credit facilities, particularly on favorable terms, could adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations or sustain and grow our businesses and could increase capital costs and collateral requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur access to capital and the cost and other terms of acquiring capital are dependent upon, and could be adversely impacted by, various factors, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and capital markets conditions, including changes in financial markets that reduce available liquidity or the ability to obtain or renew credit facilities on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nconditions and economic weakness in the ERCOT or general U.S. power markets;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\na deterioration, or perceived deterioration, of our creditworthiness, enterprise value or financial or operating results;\n\u2022\na reduction in Vistra Energy's or its applicable subsidiaries' credit ratings;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in our debt agreements;\n\u2022\na deterioration of the creditworthiness or bankruptcy of one or more lenders or counterparties under our credit facilities that affects the ability of such lender(s) to make loans to us;\n\u2022\nsecurity or collateral requirements;\n\u2022\ngeneral credit availability from banks or other lenders for us and our industry peers;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in the industry and in us and the ERCOT wholesale electricity market;\n\u2022\nvolatility in commodity prices that increases credit requirements;\n\u2022\na material breakdown in our risk management procedures;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of changes in our businesses;\n\u2022\ndisruptions, constraints, or inefficiencies in the continued reliable operation of our generation facilities, and\n\u2022\nchanges in or the operation of provisions of tax and regulatory laws.\nIn addition, we currently maintain non-investment grade credit ratings. As a result, we may not be able to access capital on terms (financial or otherwise) as favorable as companies that maintain investment grade credit ratings or we may be unable to access capital at all at times when the credit markets tighten. In addition, our non-investment grade credit ratings may result in counterparties requesting collateral support (including cash or letters of credit) in order to enter into transactions with us.\nA downgrade in long-term debt ratings generally causes borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors to shrink, and could trigger liquidity demands pursuant to contractual arrangements. Future transactions by Vistra Energy or any of its subsidiaries, including the issuance of additional debt, could result in a temporary or permanent downgrade in our credit ratings.\nThe Vistra Operations Credit Facilities impose restrictions on us and any failure to comply with these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe Vistra Operations Credit Facilities contain restrictions that could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions or to meet our capital needs and could result in an event of default under the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities. The Vistra Operations Credit Facilities contain events of default customary for financings of this type. If we fail to comply with the covenants in the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, or a default exists and is continuing, the lenders under such agreements could give notice and declare outstanding borrowings thereunder immediately due and payable. Any such acceleration of outstanding borrowings could have a material adverse effect on us.\nCertain of our obligations are required to be secured by letters of credit or cash, which increase our costs. If we are unable to provide such security, it may restrict our ability to conduct our business, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe undertake certain hedging and commodity activities and enter into certain financing arrangements with various counterparties that require cash collateral or the posting of letters of credit which are at risk of being drawn down in the event we default on our obligations. We currently use margin deposits, prepayments and letters of credit as credit support for commodity procurement and risk management activities. Future cash collateral requirements may increase based on the extent of our involvement in standard contracts and movements in commodity prices, and also based on our credit ratings and the general perception of creditworthiness in the markets in which we operate. In the case of commodity arrangements, the amount of such credit support that must be provided typically is based on the difference between the price of the commodity in a given contract and the market price of the commodity. Significant movements in market prices can result in our being required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in very large amounts. The effectiveness of our strategy may be dependent on the amount of collateral available to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity requirements may be greater than we anticipate or will be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital to post as collateral, we may not be able to manage price volatility effectively or to implement our strategy. An increase in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required to be provided to our counterparties may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future acquisitions into our business, which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have pursued acquisitions and may continue to do so. Our ability to continue to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources, including available cash and access to capital. Any expense incurred in completing acquisitions or entering into joint ventures, the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate acquired businesses successfully could result in unanticipated expenses and losses. Furthermore, we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits from any future acquisitions or joint ventures we may pursue. In addition, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenses and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the execution of our business strategy.\nCircumstances associated with potential divestitures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn evaluating our business and the strategic fit of our various assets, we may determine to sell one or more of such assets. Despite a decision to divest an asset, we may encounter difficulty in finding a buyer willing to purchase the asset at an acceptable price and on acceptable terms and in a timely manner. In addition, a prospective buyer may have difficulty obtaining financing. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the separation of operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nthe need to provide significant ongoing post-closing transition support to a buyer;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s attention may be temporarily diverted;\n\u2022\nthe retention of certain current or future liabilities in order to induce a buyer to complete a divestiture;\n\u2022\nthe obligation to indemnify or reimburse a buyer for certain past liabilities of a divested asset;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of our business, and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees.\nWe may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we may encounter in divesting any asset, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect Vistra Energy's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law a comprehensive tax reform bill (the TCJA), that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code. The TCJA, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate, a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, limitation of the deduction for certain net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income, an indefinite net operating loss carryforward, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. While we expect a beneficial impact from the TCJA from the reduction in corporate tax rates and immediate deductions for certain new investments, we continue to examine the tax reform legislation, as its overall impact is uncertain, and note that certain provisions of the TCJA or its interaction with existing law could adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition. The impact of this tax reform legislation on our stockholders is also uncertain and could be adverse.\nWe may be responsible for U.S. federal and state income tax liabilities that relate to the PrefCo Preferred Stock Sale and Spin-Off.\nPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, the parties thereto have agreed to take certain actions and refrain from taking certain actions in order to preserve the intended tax treatment of the Spin-Off and to indemnify the other parties to the extent a breach of such covenant results in additional taxes to the other parties. If we breach such a covenant (or, in certain circumstances, if our stockholders or creditors of our Predecessor take or took certain actions that result in the intended tax treatment of the Spin-Off not to be preserved), we may be required to make substantial indemnification payments to the other parties to the Tax Matters Agreement.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement also allocates the responsibility for taxes for periods prior to the Spin-Off between EFH Corp. and us. For periods prior to the Spin-Off, (i) Vistra Energy is generally required to reimburse EFH Corp. with respect to any taxes paid by EFH Corp. that are attributable to us and (ii) EFH Corp. is generally required to reimburse us with respect to any taxes paid by us that are attributable to EFH Corp.\nWe are also required to indemnify EFH Corp. against certain taxes in the event the IRS or another taxing authority successfully challenges the amount of gain relating to the PrefCo Preferred Stock Sale or the amount or allowance of EFH Corp.'s net operating loss deductions.\nOur indemnification obligations to EFH Corp. are not limited by any maximum amount. If we are required to indemnify EFH Corp. or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nWe are required to pay the holders of TRA Rights for certain tax benefits, which amounts are expected to be substantial.\nOn the Effective Date, we entered into the TRA with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as the transfer agent. Pursuant to the TRA, we issued beneficial interests in the rights to receive payments under the TRA (TRA Rights) to the first lien creditors of our Predecessor to be held in escrow for the benefit of the first lien creditors of our Predecessor entitled to receive such TRA Rights under the Plan of Reorganization. Our financial statements reflect a liability of $357 million as of December 31, 2017 related to these future payment obligations (see Note 9 to the Financial Statements). This amount is based on certain assumptions as described more fully in the notes to the financial statements and the actual payments made under the TRA could be materially different than this estimate.\nThe TRA provides for the payment by us to the holders of TRA Rights of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we and our subsidiaries actually realize as a result of our use of (a) the tax basis step up attributable to the PrefCo Preferred Stock Sale, (b) the entire tax basis of the assets acquired as a result of the purchase and sale agreement, dated as of November 25, 2015 by and between La Frontera Ventures, LLC and Luminant, and (c) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of payments under the TRA. The amount and timing of any payments under the TRA will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the tax rate then applicable, our use of loss carryovers and the portion of our payments under the TRA constituting imputed interest.\nAlthough we are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge the tax benefits that are the subject of the TRA, recipients of the payments under the TRA will not be required to reimburse us for any payments previously made if such tax benefits are subsequently disallowed. As a result, in such circumstances, Vistra Energy could make payments under the TRA that are greater than its actual cash tax savings. Any amount of excess payment can be used to reduce future TRA payments, but cannot be immediately recouped, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nBecause Vistra Energy is a holding company with no operations of its own, its ability to make payments under the TRA is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to make distributions to it. To the extent that Vistra Energy is unable to make payments under the TRA because of the inability of its subsidiaries to make distributions to us for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid, which could adversely affect our results of operations and could also affect our liquidity in periods in which such payments are made.\nThe payments we will be required to make under the TRA could be substantial.\nWe may be required to make an early termination payment to the holders of TRA Rights under the TRA.\nThe TRA provides that, in the event that Vistra Energy breaches any of its material obligations under the TRA, or upon certain mergers, asset sales, or other forms of business combination or certain other changes of control, the transfer agent under the TRA may treat such event as an early termination of the TRA, in which case Vistra Energy would be required to make an immediate payment to the holders of the TRA Rights equal to the present value (at a discount rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points) of the anticipated future tax benefits based on certain valuation assumptions.\nAs a result, upon any such breach or change of control, we could be required to make a lump sum payment under the TRA before we realize any actual cash tax savings and such lump sum payment could be greater than our future actual cash tax savings.\nThe aggregate amount of these accelerated payments could be materially more than our estimated liability for payments made under the TRA set forth in our financial statements. Based on this estimation, our obligations under the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity.\nWe are potentially liable for U.S. income taxes of the entire EFH Corp. consolidated group for all taxable years in which we were a member of such group.\nPrior to the Spin-Off, EFH Corporate Services Company, EFH Properties Company and certain other subsidiary corporations were included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax group of which EFH Corp. was the common parent (EFH Corp. Consolidated Group). In addition, pursuant to the private letter ruling from the IRS that we received in connection with the Spin-Off, Vistra Energy will be considered a member of the EFH Corp. Consolidated Group immediately prior to the Spin-Off. Under U.S. federal income tax laws, any corporation that is a member of a consolidated group at any time during a taxable year is severally liable for the group's entire federal income tax liability for the entire taxable year. In addition, entities that are disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be liable as successors under common law theories or under certain regulations to the extent corporations transferred assets to such entities or merged or otherwise consolidated into such entities, whether under state law or purely as a matter of federal income tax law. Thus, notwithstanding any contractual rights to be reimbursed or indemnified by EFH Corp. pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, to the extent EFH Corp. or other members of the EFH Corp. Consolidated Group fail to make any U.S. federal income tax payments required of them by law in respect of taxable years for which the Company or any subsidiary noted above was a member of the EFH Corp. Consolidated Group, the Company or such subsidiary may be liable for the shortfall. At such time, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to satisfy such payment obligation.\nOur ability to claim a portion of depreciation deductions may be limited for a period of time.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation's ability to utilize certain tax attributes, including depreciation, may be limited following an ownership change if the corporation's overall asset tax basis exceeds the overall fair market value of its assets (after making certain adjustments). The Spin-Off resulted in an ownership change for the Company and it is expected that the overall tax basis of our assets may have exceeded the overall fair market value of our assets at such time. As a result, there may be a limitation on our ability to claim a portion of our depreciation deductions for a five-year period. This limitation could have a material impact on our tax liabilities and on our obligations under the TRA Rights. In addition, any future ownership change of Vistra Energy following Emergence could likewise result in additional limitations on our ability to use certain tax attributes existing at the time of any such ownership change and have an impact on our tax liabilities and on our obligations under the TRA.\nRegulatory and Legislative Risks\nOur businesses are subject to ongoing complex governmental regulations and legislation that have impacted, and may in the future impact, our businesses, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur businesses operate in changing market environments influenced by various state and federal legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding the restructuring of the energy industry, including competition in power generation and sale of electricity. Although we attempt to comply with changing legislative and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that we will fail to adapt to any such changes successfully or on a timely basis.\nOur businesses are subject to numerous state and federal laws (including PURA, the Federal Power Act, the Atomic Energy Act, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), changing governmental policy and regulatory actions (including those of the PUCT, the NERC, the TRE, the RCT, the TCEQ, the FERC, the MSHA, the EPA, the NRC and CFTC) and the rules, guidelines and protocols of ERCOT with respect to various matters, including, but not limited to, market structure and design, operation of nuclear generation facilities, construction and operation of other generation facilities, development, operation and reclamation of lignite mines, recovery of costs and investments, decommissioning costs, market behavior rules, present or prospective wholesale and retail competition and environmental matters. We, along with other market participants, are subject to electricity pricing constraints and market behavior and other competition-related rules and regulations under PURA that are administered by the PUCT and ERCOT. Changes in, revisions to, or reinterpretations of, existing laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us. Further, in the future we could expand our business, through acquisitions or otherwise, to geographic areas outside of Texas and the ERCOT market (e.g. such as through the Merger). Such expansion would subject us to additional state regulatory requirements that could have material adverse effect on us.\nThe Texas Legislature meets every two years. The next regular legislative session is scheduled to begin in January 2019. However, at any time the governor of Texas may convene a special session of the legislature. During any regular or special session, bills may be introduced that, if adopted, could materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe are required to obtain, and to comply with, government permits and approvals.\nWe are required to obtain, and to comply with, numerous permits and licenses from federal, state and local governmental agencies. The process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits and licenses can be lengthy and complex and can sometimes result in the establishment of conditions that make the project or activity for which the permit or license was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. In addition, such permits or licenses may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or licenses, or failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, may result in the delay or temporary suspension of our operations and electricity sales or the curtailment of our delivery of electricity to our customers and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions. Although various regulators routinely renew existing permits and licenses, renewal of our existing permits or licenses could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including (a) failure to provide adequate financial assurance for closure, (b) failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permit conditions, (c) local community, political or other opposition and (d) executive, legislative or regulatory action.\nOur inability to procure and comply with the permits and licenses required for our operations, or the cost to us of such procurement or compliance, could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, new environmental legislation or regulations, if enacted, or changed interpretations of existing laws, may cause routine maintenance activities at our facilities to need to be changed in order to avoid violating applicable laws and regulations or elicit claims that historical routine maintenance activities at our facilities violated applicable laws and regulations. In addition to the possible imposition of fines in the case of any such violations, we may be required to undertake significant capital investments in emissions control technology and obtain additional operating permits or licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur cost of compliance with existing and new environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation by governmental authorities, including the EPA and the TCEQ. We may incur significant additional costs beyond those currently contemplated to comply with these regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, we could be subject to administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and fines. Existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur, including potential regulatory and enforcement developments related to air emissions, all of which could result in significant additional costs beyond those currently contemplated to comply with existing requirements. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe EPA has recently finalized or proposed several regulatory actions establishing new requirements for control of certain emissions from sources, including electricity generation facilities. In the future, the EPA may also propose and finalize additional regulatory actions that may adversely affect our existing generation facilities or our ability to cost-effectively develop new generation facilities. There is no assurance that the currently installed emissions control equipment at our lignite, coal and/or natural gas-fueled generation facilities will satisfy the requirements under any future EPA or TCEQ regulations. Some of the recent regulatory actions and proposed actions, such as the EPA's Regional Haze Federal Implementation Plans (FIP) for reasonable progress and best available retrofit technology (BART), could require us to install significant additional control equipment, resulting in potentially material costs of compliance for our generation units, including capital expenditures, higher operating and fuel costs and potential production curtailments if the rules take effect as proposed or finalized. These costs could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, if we fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval or if an approval is retroactively disallowed or adversely modified, the operation of our generation facilities could be stopped, disrupted, curtailed or modified or become subject to additional costs. Any such stoppage, disruption, curtailment, modification or additional costs could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, we may be responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of facilities that we have acquired, leased or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are now known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and sales of assets, we may obtain, or be required to provide, indemnification against certain environmental liabilities. Another party could, depending on the circumstances, assert an environmental claim against us or fail to meet its indemnification obligations to us.\nWe could be materially and adversely affected if current regulations are implemented or if new federal or state legislation or regulations are adopted to address global climate change, or if we are subject to lawsuits for alleged damage to persons or property resulting from greenhouse gas emissions.\nThere is a concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and how GHG emissions, such as CO2, contribute to global climate change. Over the last several years, the U.S. Congress has considered and debated, and President Obama's administration previously discussed, several proposals intended to address climate change using different approaches, including a cap on carbon emissions with emitters allowed to trade unused emission allowances (cap-and-trade), a tax on carbon or GHG emissions, incentives for the development of low-carbon technology and federal renewable portfolio standards. In October 2015, the EPA finalized regulations under the CAA to limit CO2 emissions from existing generating units, referred to as the Clean Power Plan. If implemented as finalized, the Clean Power Plan would require the closure of a significant number of coal-fueled electric generating units nationwide and in Texas. The Clean Power Plan is currently stayed pending the conclusion of legal challenges on the rule. In October 2017, the EPA proposed the repeal of the Clean Power Plan. In addition, a number of federal court cases have been filed in recent years asserting damage claims related to GHG emissions, and the results in those proceedings could establish adverse precedent that might apply to companies (including us) that produce GHG emissions. We could be materially and adversely affected if new federal and/or state legislation or regulations are adopted to address global climate change, if the Clean Power Plan is implemented as finalized or if we are subject to lawsuits for alleged damage to persons or property resulting from GHG emissions.\nThe availability and cost of emission allowances could adversely impact our costs of operations.\nWe are required to maintain, through either allocations or purchases, sufficient emission allowances for SO2 and NOX to support our operations in the ordinary course of operating our power generation facilities. These allowances are used to meet the obligations imposed on us by various applicable environmental laws. If our operational needs require more than our allocated allowances, we may be forced to purchase such allowances on the open market, which could be costly. If we are unable to maintain sufficient emission allowances to match our operational needs, we may have to curtail our operations so as not to exceed our available emission allowances, or install costly new emission controls. As we use the emission allowances that we have purchased on the open market, costs associated with such purchases will be recognized as operating expense. If such allowances are available for purchase, but only at significantly higher prices, the purchase of such allowances could materially increase our costs of operations in the affected markets.\nLuminant's mining operations are subject to RCT oversight.\nWe currently own and operate, or are in the process of reclamation, through Luminant 12 surface lignite coal mines in Texas to provide fuel for our electricity generation facilities. The RCT, which exercises broad authority to regulate reclamation activity, reviews on an ongoing basis whether Luminant is compliant with RCT rules and regulations and whether it has met all of the requirements of its mining permits. Any new rules and regulations adopted by the RCT or the Department of Interior Office of Surface Mining, which also regulates mining activity nationwide, or any changes in the interpretation of existing rules and regulations, could result in higher compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or cause a revocation of a mining permit. Any revocation of a mining permit would mean that Luminant would no longer be allowed to mine lignite at the applicable mine to serve its generation facilities. In addition, Luminant's mining reclamation obligations are secured by a first lien on its assets which is pari passu with the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities, but which would be paid first, up to $975 million, upon any liquidation of Vistra Operations Company LLC's assets. The RCT could, at any time, require that Luminant's mining reclamation obligations be secured by cash or letters of credit in lieu of such first lien. Any failure to provide any such cash or letter of credit collateral could result in Luminant no longer being able to mine lignite. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on us.\nLuminant's lignite mining reclamation activity will require significant resources as existing and retired mining operations are reclaimed over the next several years.\nIn conjunction with Luminant's recent announcements to retire several power generation assets and related mining operations, along with the continuous reclamation activity at its continuing mining operations for its mines related to the Oak Grove and Martin Lake generation assets, Luminant is expected to spend a significant amount of money, internal resources and time to complete the required reclamation activities. For the next five years, Vistra Energy is projected to spend approximately $350 million (on a nominal basis) to achieve its reclamation objectives.\nLitigation, legal proceedings, regulatory investigations or other administrative proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and reputation damage that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving, among other matters, employment, commercial, and environmental issues, and other claims for injuries and damages. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these evaluations and estimates, when required by applicable accounting rules, we establish reserves and disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These evaluations and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from current evaluations and estimates. The settlement or resolution of such claims or proceedings may have a material adverse effect on us. We use appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against us, but the litigation environment poses a significant business risk.\nWe are also involved in the ordinary course of business in regulatory investigations and other administrative proceedings, and we are exposed to the risk that we may become the subject of additional regulatory investigations or administrative proceedings. While we cannot predict the outcome of any regulatory investigation or administrative proceeding, any such regulatory investigation or administrative proceeding could result in us incurring material penalties and/or other costs and have a materially adverse effect on us.\nThe REP certification of our retail operation is subject to PUCT review.\nThe PUCT may at any time initiate an investigation into whether our retail operation complies with certain PUCT rules and whether we have met all of the requirements for REP certification, including financial requirements. Any removal or revocation of a REP certification would mean that we would no longer be allowed to provide electricity service to retail customers. Such decertification could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, any capital or other expenditures that we are required by the PUCT to undertake in order to achieve or maintain any such compliance could also have a material adverse effect on us.\nOperational Risks\nOur retail operations are subject to significant competition from other REPs, which could result in a loss of existing customers and the inability to attract new customers.\nWe operate in a very competitive retail market and, as a result, our retail operation faces significant competition for customers. We believe our TXU EnergyTM brand is viewed favorably in the retail electricity markets in which we operate, but despite our commitment to providing superior customer service and innovative products, customer sentiment toward our brand, including by comparison to our competitors' brands, depends on certain factors beyond our control. For example, competitor REPs may offer different products, lower electricity prices and other incentives, which, despite our long-standing relationship with many customers, may attract customers away from us. If we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in the retail market it is possible our retail customer counts could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs we try to grow our retail business and operate our business strategy, we compete with various other REPs that may have certain advantages over us. For example, in new markets, our principal competitor for new customers may be the incumbent REP, which has the advantage of long-standing relationships with its customers, including well-known brand recognition. In addition to competition from the incumbent REP, we may face competition from a number of other energy service providers, other energy industry participants, or nationally branded providers of consumer products and services who may develop businesses that will compete with us. Some of these competitors or potential competitors may be larger than we are or have greater resources or access to capital than we have. If there is inadequate potential margin in retail electricity markets with substantial competition to overcome the adverse effect of relatively high customer acquisition costs in such markets, it may not be profitable for us to compete in these markets.\nOur retail operations rely on the infrastructure of local utilities or independent transmission system operators to provide electricity to, and to obtain information about, our customers. Any infrastructure failure could negatively impact customer satisfaction and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur retail operations depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by unaffiliated utilities to deliver the electricity that we sell to our customers. If transmission capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver electricity may be hindered and we may have to forgo sales or buy more expensive wholesale electricity than is available in the capacity-constrained area. For example, during some periods, transmission access is constrained in some areas of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, where we have a significant number of customers. The cost to provide service to these customers may exceed the cost to provide service to other customers, resulting in lower operating margins. In addition, any infrastructure failure that interrupts or impairs delivery of electricity to our customers could negatively impact customer satisfaction with our service. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may suffer material losses, costs and liabilities due to ownership and operation of the Comanche Peak nuclear generation facility.\nWe own and operate a nuclear generation facility in Glen Rose, Texas (Comanche Peak Facility). The ownership and operation of a nuclear generation facility involves certain risks. These risks include:\n\u2022\nunscheduled outages or unexpected costs due to equipment, mechanical, structural, cyber security or other problems;\n\u2022\ninadequacy or lapses in maintenance protocols;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of reactor operation and safety systems due to human error or force majeure;\n\u2022\nthe costs of, and liabilities relating to, storage, handling, treatment, transport, release, use and disposal of radioactive materials;\n\u2022\nthe costs of procuring nuclear fuel;\n\u2022\nthe costs of storing and maintaining spent nuclear fuel at our on-site dry cask storage facility;\n\u2022\nterrorist or cyber security attacks and the cost to protect against any such attack;\n\u2022\nthe impact of a natural disaster;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the amounts and types of insurance coverage commercially available, and\n\u2022\nuncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of modifying or decommissioning nuclear facilities at the end of their useful lives.\nAny prolonged unavailability of the Comanche Peak Facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, cash flows, financial position and reputation. The following are among the more significant related risks:\n\u2022\nOperational Risk - Operations at any generation facility could degrade to the point where the facility would have to be shut down. If such degradations were to occur at the Comanche Peak Facility, the process of identifying and correcting the causes of the operational downgrade to return the facility to operation could require significant time and expense, resulting in both lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. Furthermore, a shut-down or failure at any other nuclear generation facility could cause regulators to require a shut-down or reduced availability at the Comanche Peak Facility.\n\u2022\nRegulatory Risk - The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under it or the terms of the licenses of nuclear generation facilities. Unless extended, as to which no assurance can be given, the NRC operating licenses for the two licensed operating units at the Comanche Peak Facility will expire in 2030 and 2033, respectively. Changes in regulations by the NRC, as well as any extension of our operating licenses, could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or result in increased operating or decommissioning costs.\n\u2022\nNuclear Accident Risk - Although the safety record of the Comanche Peak Facility and other nuclear generation facilities generally has been very good, accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred both in the U.S. and elsewhere. The consequences of an accident can be severe and include loss of life, injury, lasting negative health impacts and property damage. Any accident, or perceived accident, could result in significant liabilities and damage our reputation. Any such resulting liability from a nuclear accident could exceed our resources, including insurance coverage, and could ultimately result in the suspension or termination of power generation from the Comanche Peak Facility.\nThe operation and maintenance of power generation facilities and related mining operations involve significant risks that could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe operation and maintenance of power generation facilities and related mining operations involve many risks, including, as applicable, start-up risks, breakdown or failure of facilities, equipment or processes, operator error, lack of sufficient capital to maintain the facilities, the dependence on a specific fuel source, the inability to transport our product to our customers in an efficient manner due to the lack of transmission capacity or the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural events, or terrorist attacks, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output, efficiency or reliability, the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial lost revenues and/or increased expenses. A significant number of our facilities were constructed many years ago. In particular, older generating equipment, even if maintained or refurbished in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to operate at peak efficiency or reliability. The risk of increased maintenance and capital expenditures arises from (a) increased starting and stopping of generation equipment due to the volatility of the competitive generation market and the prospect of continuing low wholesale electricity prices that may not justify sustained or year-round operation of all our generation facilities, (b) any unexpected failure to generate power, including failure caused by equipment breakdown or unplanned outage (whether by order of applicable governmental regulatory authorities, the impact of weather events or natural disasters or otherwise), (c) damage to facilities due to storms, natural disasters, wars, terrorist or cyber/data security acts and other catastrophic events and (d) the passage of time and normal wear and tear. Further, our ability to successfully and timely complete routine maintenance or other capital projects at our existing facilities is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. Should any such efforts be unsuccessful, we could be subject to additional costs or losses and write downs of our investment in the project.\nWe cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws and regulations (including changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof), needed facility repairs and unexpected events (such as natural disasters or terrorist or cyber/data security attacks). The unexpected requirement of large capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, if we significantly modify a unit, we may be required to install the best available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable emission rates as such terms are defined under the new source review provisions of the CAA, which would likely result in substantial additional capital expenditures.\nIn addition, unplanned outages at any of our generation facilities, whether because of equipment breakdown or otherwise, typically increase our operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce our revenues as a result of selling fewer MWh or non-performance penalties or require us to incur significant costs as a result of running one of our higher cost units or to procure replacement power at spot market prices in order to fulfill contractual commitments. If we do not have adequate liquidity to meet margin and collateral requirements, we may be exposed to significant losses, may miss significant opportunities and may have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, our inability to operate our generation facilities efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs, and generate earnings and cash flow from our asset-based businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not be adequate to cover our lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments should we experience equipment breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors.\nOperation of power generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on Vistra Energy\u2019s revenues and results of operations, and Vistra Energy may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards. Our employees, contractors, customers and the general public may be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of our operations.\nPower generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, other hazards, such as nuclear accidents, dam failure, gas or other explosions, mine area collapses, fire, structural collapse, machinery failure and other dangerous incidents are inherent risks in our operations. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. Further, our employees and contractors work in, and customers and the general public may be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments at or near our operations. As a result, employees, contractors, customers and the general public are at risk for serious injury, including loss of life.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events may result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we consider adequate, but we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject and, even if we do have insurance coverage for a particular circumstance, we may be subject to a large deductible and maximum cap. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by the effects of extreme weather conditions and seasonality.\nWe may be materially affected by weather conditions and our businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis as the weather changes. In addition, we could be subject to the effects of extreme weather conditions, including sustained cold or hot temperatures, hurricanes, storms or other natural disasters, which could stress our generation facilities and result in outages, destroy our assets and result in casualty losses that are not ultimately offset by insurance proceeds, and could require increased capital expenditures or maintenance costs, including supply chain costs.\nMoreover, an extreme weather event could cause disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment, which could result in us foregoing sales of electricity and lost revenue. Similarly, an extreme weather event might affect the availability of generation and transmission capacity, limiting our ability to source or deliver power where it is needed or limit our ability to source fuel for our plants (including due to damage to rail or natural gas pipeline infrastructure). Additionally, extreme weather may result in unexpected increases in customer load, requiring our retail operation to procure additional electricity supplies at wholesale prices in excess of customer sales prices for electricity. These conditions, which cannot be reliably predicted, could have adverse consequences by requiring us to seek additional sources of electricity when wholesale market prices are high or to sell excess electricity when market prices are low, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by insufficient water supplies.\nSupplies of water are important for our generation facilities. Water in Texas is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supplies of water. In addition, in the recent past Texas has experienced sustained drought conditions that illustrate the effect such conditions may have on the water supply for certain of our generation facilities if adequate rain does not fall in the watersheds that supply our electric generating units. If we are unable to access sufficient supplies of water, it could prevent, restrict or increase the cost of operations at certain of our generation facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in technology or increased electricity conservation efforts may reduce the value of our generation facilities and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.\nTechnological advances have improved, and are likely to continue to improve, for existing and alternative methods to produce and store power, including gas turbines, wind turbines, fuel cells, micro turbines, photovoltaic (solar) cells, batteries and concentrated solar thermal devices, along with improvements in traditional technologies. Such technological advances have reduced, and are expected to continue to reduce, the costs of power production or storage to a level that will enable these technologies to compete effectively with traditional generation facilities. Consequently, the value of our more traditional generation assets could be significantly reduced as a result of these competitive advances, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, changes in technology have altered, and are expected to continue to alter, the channels through which retail customers buy electricity (i.e., self-generation or distributed-generation facilities). To the extent self-generation facilities become a more cost-effective option for ERCOT customers, our financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nTechnological advances in demand-side management and increased conservation efforts have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in a decrease in electricity demand. A significant decrease in electricity demand in ERCOT as a result of such efforts would significantly reduce the value of our generation assets. Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce power consumption. Effective power conservation by our customers could result in reduced electricity demand or significantly slow the growth in such demand. Any such reduction in demand could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, we may incur increased capital expenditures if we are required to increase investment in conservation measures.\nThe operation of our businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risk. Attacks on our infrastructure that breach cyber/data security measures could expose us to significant liabilities and reputation damage and disrupt business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nNumerous functions affecting the efficient operation of our businesses are dependent on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems and much of our information technology infrastructure is connected (directly or indirectly) to the internet. There have been numerous attacks on government and industry information technology systems through the internet that have resulted in material operational, reputation and/or financial costs. While we have controls in place designed to protect our infrastructure and we are not aware of any significant breaches in the past, a breach of cyber/data security measures that impairs our information technology infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations and affect our ability to control our generation assets, access retail customer information and limit communication with third parties. Any loss of confidential or proprietary data through a breach could adversely affect our reputation, expose us to material legal or regulatory claims and impair our ability to execute our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for our information technology infrastructure and plants.\nAs part of the continuing development of new and modified reliability standards, the FERC has approved changes to its Critical Infrastructure Protection reliability standards and has established standards for assets identified as \"critical cyber assets.\" Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC can impose penalties (up to $1 million per day, per violation) for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards, including standards to protect the power system against potential disruptions from cyber/data and physical security breaches.\nFurther, our retail business requires access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business. Examples of sensitive customer data are names, addresses, account information, historical electricity usage, expected patterns of use, payment history, credit bureau data, credit and debit card account numbers, drivers' license numbers, social security numbers and bank account information. Our retail business may need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services, such as call center operations, to the retail business. If a significant breach were to occur, the reputation of our retail business may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished, and our retail business may be subject to substantial legal or regulatory claims, any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe loss of the services of our key management and personnel could adversely affect our ability to successfully operate our businesses.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We compete for such personnel with many other companies, in and outside of our industry, government entities and other organizations. We may not be successful in retaining current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future. Our failure to attract highly qualified new personnel or retain highly qualified existing personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully operate our businesses.\nWe could be materially and adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by our unionized employees.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,630 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. The initial term of such collective bargaining agreements expired on March 31, 2017, but they all remain effective pursuant to evergreen provisions unless and until terminated on prior notice by either party. We are currently negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with one of our local unions, while new agreements with our two other local unions have been ratified, but not yet executed. In the event that our union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or disruption, we would be responsible for procuring replacement labor or we could experience reduced power generation or outages. Our ability to procure such labor is uncertain. Strikes, work stoppages or the inability to negotiate current or future collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Related to Our Structure and Ownership of our Common Stock\nVistra Energy is a holding company and its ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries is structurally subordinated to existing and future liabilities and preferred equity of its subsidiaries.\nVistra Energy is a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of its own. As a result, Vistra Energy's cash flows and ability to meet its obligations are largely dependent upon the operating cash flows of Vistra Energy's subsidiaries and the payment of such operating cash flows to Vistra Energy in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. These subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities from Vistra Energy and have no obligation (other than any existing contractual obligations) to provide Vistra Energy with funds to satisfy its obligations. Any decision by a subsidiary to provide Vistra Energy with funds to satisfy its obligations, including those under the TRA, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise, will depend on, among other things, such subsidiary's results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, cash requirements, contractual prohibitions and other restrictions, applicable law and other factors. The deterioration of income from, or other available assets of, any such subsidiary for any reason could limit or impair its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to Vistra Energy.\nWe may not pay any dividends on our common stock in the future.\nWe have no present intention to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends to holders of our common stock in the future will be at the sole discretion of the Board and will depend upon many factors, including our historical and anticipated financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and results of operations, capital requirements, market conditions, our growth strategy and the availability of growth opportunities, contractual prohibitions and other restrictions with respect to the payment of dividends, applicable law and other factors that the Board deems relevant.\nA small number of stockholders could be able to significantly influence our business and affairs.\nThe three largest groups of stockholders of Vistra Energy, affiliates of Apollo Management Holdings L.P. (collectively, the Apollo Entities), affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Private Institutional Capital Adviser (Canada), L.P. (collectively, the Brookfield Entities), and affiliates of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (collectively, the Oaktree Entities, and together with the Apollo Entities and the Brookfield Entities, the Principal Stockholders), all of which were first lien creditors of our Predecessor prior to Emergence, collectively currently own approximately 45% of our common stock outstanding. Large holders such as the Principal Stockholders may be able to affect matters requiring approval by holders of our common stock, including the election of directors and the approval of any strategic transactions, including the Merger. The Principal Stockholders entered into the Merger Support Agreement in connection with the Merger pursuant to which they have agreed, subject to certain circumstances, to vote their shares of Vistra Energy common stock in favor of the Merger Proposal and the Stock Issuance Proposal (see Note 2 to the Financial Statements). Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of stockholders' agreements entered into with each of the Principal Stockholders, each Principal Stockholder is entitled to designate one director to serve on the Board as a Class III director for so long as it beneficially owns, in the aggregate, at least 22,500,000 shares of our common stock. It is expected that each of the Principal Stockholders will own enough equity in the combined company as of the closing of the Merger that each will still have a representative on the combined company's board of directors.\nConflicts of interest may arise because some members of the Board are representatives of the Principal Stockholders.\nThe Principal Stockholders could invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us. As a result of these relationships, when conflicts arise between the interests of the Principal Stockholders or their affiliates and the interests of other stockholders, members of the Board that are representatives of the Principal Stockholders may not be disinterested. Neither the Principal Stockholders nor the representatives of the Principal Stockholders on the Board, by the terms of the Vistra Energy certificate of incorporation, are required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to their other affiliates, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as members of the Board.\nAdditionally, pursuant to a letter agreement with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., affiliates of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. have committed to use commercially reasonable efforts to divest a portion of their shares of our common stock or Dynegy common stock in connection with the Merger, but are not obligated to consummate such divestment other than at prices per share of Dynegy common stock or our common stock determined from time to time in Oaktree's sole and absolute discretion to be adequate. The Merger Support Agreement provides that if affiliates of Oaktree have not sold the number of shares of our common stock or Dynegy common stock contemplated in the Oaktree Letter Agreement, then Dynegy will purchase shares of Dynegy common stock from such affiliates of Oaktree so that the target ownership level is met. Such purchase by Dynegy, if applicable, will be consummated immediately prior to the closing of the Merger and will be for a cash purchase price of $13.24 per share.\nWe are unable to take certain actions because such actions could jeopardize the intended tax treatment of the Spin-Off, and such restrictions could be significant.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement prohibits us from taking certain actions that could reasonably be expected to undermine the intended tax treatment the Spin-Off or to jeopardize the conclusions of the IRS private letter ruling that we received in connection with the Spin-Off or opinions of counsel received by us or EFH Corp. In particular, for two years after the Spin-Off, we may not:\n\u2022\ncease the active conduct of our business;\n\u2022\ncease to hold certain assets;\n\u2022\nvoluntarily dissolve or liquidate;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with any other person in a transaction that does not qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;\n\u2022\nredeem or otherwise repurchase (directly or indirectly) any of our equity interests other than pursuant to an open market stock repurchase program that satisfies the requirements in the Tax Matters Agreement, or\n\u2022\ndirectly or indirectly acquire any of the PrefCo Preferred Stock.\nNevertheless, we are permitted to take any of the actions described above if (a) we obtain written consent from EFH Corp., (b) such action or transaction is described in or otherwise consistent with the facts in the private letter ruling we obtained from the IRS in connection with the Spin-Off, (c) we obtain a supplemental private letter ruling from the IRS or (d) we obtain an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law or accounting firm that is reasonably acceptable to EFH Corp. that the action will not affect the intended tax treatment of the Spin-Off.\nThe covenants and other limitations with respect to the Tax Matters Agreement may limit our ability to undertake certain transactions that would otherwise be value-maximizing.\nProvisions in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the TRA might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of Vistra Energy or changes in our management and therefore depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Vistra Energy and the TRA contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of Vistra Energy or changes in our management that stockholders may deem advantageous. These provisions in our bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that the Board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\ncreate a classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, and require that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board is expressly authorized to make, amend or repeal our bylaws, and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, the TRA provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combination or certain other changes of control, the transfer agent under the TRA may treat such event as an early termination of the TRA, in which case we would be required to make a lump-sum payment under the TRA, which could be significant and could be significantly greater than the amount of the obligation reported in our consolidated balance sheets. This payment obligation may discourage potential buyers from acquiring Vistra Energy.", "PERMNO": 16736, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "VST"}
