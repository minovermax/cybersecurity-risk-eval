RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, before making an investment decision. Any of these risks, uncertainties and other factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. See also \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Cybersecurity Business\nFinjan\u2019s limited operating history following its 2009 asset sale makes it difficult to evaluate its current business and future prospects.\nFollowing the sale of Finjan\u2019s sales, marketing and certain other assets in 2009, Finjan\u2019s business has consisted primarily of the licensing and enforcement activities described under \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d Since 2009, Finjan has generated significant, but sporadic cash flows and net income through its licensing and enforcement activities. Finjan has a limited track record, as a stand-alone entity, in executing its business plan which includes, among other things, acquiring, prosecuting, licensing, litigating or otherwise monetizing patent assets, our cybersecurity consulting business, and developing mobile security applications. Finjan\u2019s limited operating history, as a stand-alone entity, in its current line of business makes it difficult to evaluate our current business model and future prospects. There is a significant risk that we will not be able to implement or execute our current business plan, or demonstrate that our business plan is sound.\nWe are presently substantially reliant on a limited number of patented technologies that we own through Finjan.\nWe derive substantially all of our income from a relatively small number of patented technologies. As of December 31, 2016, our assets consisted primarily of 28 U.S. and 38 international patents with additional pending applications we are processing in patent offices around the world. Finjan\u2019s current U.S. issued patents begin to expire at various times from 2017 through 2032, and it currently has two U.S. patent applications and one international patent applications pending as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As new technological advances occur, many of the patented technologies we own through Finjan may become obsolete before they are completely monetized. If we are unable to monetize our current patent assets for any reason, including obsolescence of our technologies, the expiration of our patents, or challenges to the enforceability of our patents through patent office ex parte re-examination or Inter Partes Reviews (\"IPRs\") or any other reason, our business and prospects would be materially harmed.\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nWe reported net income from operations of $0.3 million and a net loss of $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $13.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and working capital of $11.2 million. Although we reported net income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, we expect to continue incurring significant legal and other selling, general and administrative expenses in connection with our operations. As a result, we may incur losses in future periods depending on revenue. We believe, however, that our existing revenue opportunities, balances of cash and cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to finance our anticipated capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this annual report. Such belief is based on current forecasts and assumptions regarding licensing of our technology, which are currently at various stages of negotiation (which may not be successfully completed), our emerging business, as well as other financing and revenue sources. We may not be successful in finalizing such licensing efforts and, even if successful, may need to raise additional capital in order to provide sufficient funds to support and grow our business.\nAny failure to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights could materially impair our business.\nOur ability to successfully operate our business depends largely on the validity and enforceability of our patents and the relevance of our patent rights to commercially viable products or services. Third parties have challenged, and we expect will continue to challenge, the infringement, validity and enforceability of certain of our patents. In some instances, our patent claims could be substantially narrowed or declared invalid, unenforceable, not essential, not infringed or a combination of the foregoing. We cannot assure you that the validity and enforceability of our patents will be maintained or that our patent claims will be applicable to any particular product or service. In addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d) could invalidate or render unenforceable our patents or materially narrow the scope of the patent claims during the course of USPTO post-grant proceedings such as, for example, re-examinations or IPRs. Any significant adverse finding by the USPTO or adverse verdict of a court as to the validity, enforceability or scope of certain of our patents and/or any successful design around certain of our patents could materially and adversely affect our ability to secure future settlements or licenses on favorable terms, if at all, and otherwise harm our business.\nUnder the American Invents Act (\u201cAIA\u201d), patents previously granted by the USPTO may be reviewed through post-patent grant proceedings such as reexaminations or IPRs. The basic characteristics of Ex Parte reexamination are: the patent owner or a third party may request the USPTO to reexamine an issued U.S. patent based on patents and printed publications that the requester submits for the USPTO\u2019s consideration. The requester must establish that the submitted prior art establishes a substantial and new question of patentability, and if the requester meets such burden, the USPTO will grant the request and order reexamination of the patent at issue. Unless the requester of the reexamination is the patent owner, the requester\u2019s participation terminates following such reexamination order and only the patent owner may proceed. The patent owner can appeal the final decision of the Central Reexamination Unit (\u201cCRU\u201d) of the USPTO to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d), and may further appeal a negative decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\u201cCAFC\u201d).\nGenerally, the grounds on which a petition for IPR is granted is whether the claimed invention is patentable strictly in light of prior art consisting of patents or printed publications. The petitioner must demonstrate that there is a reasonable likelihood that he/she/it will prevail as to at least one of the patent claims challenged to trigger the IPR. The PTAB decides on petitions and can reject them if the prior art is the same or substantially the same prior art or arguments previously presented to the USPTO. If the petition is granted, an IPR is statutorily required to be completed within one year of institution, which is extendable for up to six months for good cause. Unlike reexaminations, the third party petitioner may stay involved in the proceedings. IPRs are handled at the outset by the PTAB and do not go through the CRU of the USPTO. Final decisions of the PTAB are immediately appealable to the CAFC, either by the patent owner or the third party.\nIt is becoming a trend, if not a practice, for accused infringers to petition for reexaminations or IPRs of asserted patents as these proceedings may give the petitioner \u201ctwo bites at the apple\u201d. Parties to our enforcement actions may initiate IPRs with respect to our patents in the future. Although we believe our patents are patentable in light of prior art, these proceedings are relatively new and unpredictable. The outcome of the proceedings can range from decisions favorable to the patent holder, favorable to both parties, or favorable to the petitioner. If the outcome is the latter, the value of the challenged patent can be materially reduced or extinguished.\nOur licensing cycle is lengthy and costly, and our licensing efforts may be unsuccessful.\nThe process of engaging a potential licensee to adopt a license can be lengthy and may not always result in a license agreement. It may take many months or longer to identify potential licensees, prepare marketing, technical or other materials, educate potential licensees on the benefits of entering into a license and agree, if at all, to licensing terms, conditions and price. Even after expending significant time and resources into licensing efforts, we may be unsuccessful in entering into a licensing agreement with a potential licensee. As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins, if at all.\nWe currently are, and expect to continue to be involved in costly, time-consuming and uncertain litigation and administrative actions to enforce our patents, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business.\nIf we believe a third party is infringing one or more of our patents and refuses to obtain a license to use our patented technologies, we may be compelled to commence legal or administrative action against those third parties. Patent litigation is inherently uncertain and we cannot predict the outcome of any litigation or administrative action. Moreover, many of the parties we believe infringe our patents are large and well-funded companies with substantially greater resources than we have and may devote substantial resources toward avoiding or limiting liability and the amount of associated damages for infringing our patents. We could also face counterclaims that challenge the essential nature, validity, enforceability or infringement of our patents. Regardless of whether legal action is successful, legal and expert fees and other costs associated with enforcement action are significant.\nOur cash flows can be unpredictable, and this may harm our financial condition or the market price for our common stock.\nThe amount and timing of cash flows from our licensing and enforcement activities are subject to uncertainties stemming primarily from uncertainties regarding the rates of adoption of our patented technologies, our lengthy license negotiation cycles, the growth rates of our licensees, the outcome of enforcement actions and certain other factors. As such, our income and cash flows may vary significantly from period to period, which could make our business difficult to manage, adversely affect our business and operating results, cause our annual or quarterly results to fall below market expectations and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur cash flows and income have been derived from a limited number of sources.\nOur net income in recent years has been derived from a limited number of license agreements and settlements, and we expect that, in the near term, any income that we generate will be derived from a limited number of sources. In 2016, we derived approximately $18.4 million of income from license agreements with 6 licensees. In 2015, we derived approximately $4.7 million of income from three licensees. If we are unable to reach settlements and license agreements with a sufficient number of identified third parties who use our technologies, our future income and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nWe may raise additional capital to support our present business plan and our anticipated business growth, and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, which would adversely affect our ability to operate.\nIn May 2016, we raised $10.2 million through the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock. Based on our current operating plans (which includes our expectation of signing additional license agreements in 2017, which may not occur), our current resources are expected to be sufficient to fund our planned operations at least for the coming twelve months. We nonetheless may raise additional financing to fund licensing and enforcement actions, planned research and development activities and to better solidify our financial position. We may also need to raise additional funds in connection with any acquisitions of technology or intellectual property assets that we pursue. Such additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, which would adversely affect our operations. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or additional equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders.\nFurther, if we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our business plans, which would harm our operating results.\nAny debt we incur in the future in capital raising efforts may limit our flexibility to obtain further financing and to pursue other business opportunities.\nIf our anticipated capital raising efforts involve debt financing, we will have limitations on our ability to raise additional debt financing or incur liens, as well as other limitations. Such limitations may limit our flexibility to pursue other business opportunities. Additionally, our future level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nour funds available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions to stockholders will be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to make future interest payments on any debt incurred; and\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally.\nOur ability to service any debt raised in the future will depend upon, among other things, our successful monetization of our patents, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize our new business or identify additional sources of revenue, our financial condition and operations may be materially adversely impacted.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from license and settlement agreements related to our patented technologies. In 2015, we launched our new cybersecurity advisory business, CybeRisk, and our mobile security business, Finjan Mobile. Since such businesses are relatively new and unproven, they may not yield any viable new revenue, inventions or technology, which would lead to a loss of our investment in such activities. Such activities could also distract our management team from its present business initiatives, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from such businesses or invent or acquire new technologies or products, our financial condition and operations may be materially impacted. To date, we have not engaged in any material acquisitions of technology or intellectual property assets from unaffiliated third parties. If we are unable to establish and maintain relationships within our industry, we may not be able to identify new technology-based opportunities for sustainable revenues and growth. Even if we are successful in establishing relationships with sources of technology, those relationships may not provide the volume or quality of technology and/or intellectual property assets necessary to sustain our licensing and enforcement business. If we are unable to identify and establish meaningful relationships with sources of technology and intellectual property our growth strategy may fail and our financial condition and operations may be materially adversely impacted.\nWe may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.\nIf new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, and/or development of new technologies or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses could increase significantly. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results would decline. We expect research and development expenses to increase in the foreseeable future as our technology development efforts continue.\nWe may be unable to achieve the financial or other goals intended at the time of any potential acquisition.\nOur growth strategy includes the potential acquisition of patent, technology or other business assets or companies to further diversify our assets and business operations. We may not be successful in identifying or funding acquisitions that are consistent with our strategy or in completing such acquisitions. Acquisitions of patent, technology or other business assets or companies are subject to numerous potential risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nour inability to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any potential acquisition, or if we are able to enter into such agreement, our inability to consummate the potential acquisition;\n\u2022\nour inability to achieve the anticipated financial and other benefits of a specific acquisition;\n\u2022\nour inability to retain key personnel from an acquired company, if necessary;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration process;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\nfailure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues, including issues with respect to patented technologies and patent portfolios, and other legal and financial contingencies.\nIf we are unable to manage these risks effectively as part of any acquisition, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. Depending upon the nature and structure of future acquisitions, our stockholders may not have the ability to vote on, or consent to, the consummation of any such acquisition.\nTechnologies we acquire in the future, if any, may not be commercially successful.\nWe may acquire patents and technologies that are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies may be untested and subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which such patents and technologies are adopted in products and services. These technologies may require long development cycles and a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether technologies we acquire will have value that can be timely monetized, if at all.\nFailures in our due diligence and/or inaccuracies of representations and warranties made by third parties may expose us to material liabilities, write-downs or write-offs in the future.\nWe expect to conduct due diligence investigations of the patent technology or other intellectual property assets of companies we seek to acquire in the future. Due diligence is time consuming and expensive and, at times, we may also rely on opinions or representations or warranties of third parties to supplement, replace or support our own independent due diligence. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on particular patent technology or other intellectual property assets or companies, this diligence may not reveal all material issues that affect the acquisition. If our diligence fails to identify issues related to the applicable patent, technology or other intellectual property assets or companies or industry to which they relate, or opinions, representations or warranties prove to be inaccurate, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our common stock. In addition, we may acquire patent technologies or other intellectual property assets or companies from a seller who does not have proper title to those assets. In those cases, we could lose part or all of our investment in the assets.\nOur acquisitions of technology and patent assets may be time consuming, complex and costly, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAcquisitions of patent, technology or other intellectual property assets or companies may be time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. As a result, we expect to incur significant operating expenses and may be required to raise capital during the negotiations even if the acquisition is ultimately not consummated. We may incur significant costs to organize and negotiate a structured acquisition that does not ultimately result in an acquisition of any patent, technology or other intellectual property assets or companies or, if consummated, proves to be unprofitable for us. These costs could adversely affect our operating results, and if we incur losses, the value of our securities could decline.\nIt may be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts that we are owed under licensing agreements, and this may cause us to lose revenues.\nWe anticipate that the terms of future license agreements may require licensees to document their use of our technologies and report related data to us on a periodic basis. Although license terms may give us the right to audit books and records of licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive and time consuming, and may not be cost-effective based on our understanding of a licensee\u2019s business. Furthermore, any license compliance program that we establish to audit certain licensees in order to review the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports may not be effective to ensure that we receive royalties to which we are entitled.\nWe depend on key senior management, engineering, patent and licensing resources.\nOur future success depends largely upon the continued contributions of our directors, executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel with specialized patent, licensing, and other skills (particularly in the cybersecurity field). The loss of members of our management or key personnel could adversely affect our business. The market for such talent in our industry is extremely competitive, especially in Silicon Valley. In particular, competition exists for qualified individuals with expertise in patents and in licensing and the ability to identify and acquire technologies and patent assets. The failure to attract and retain such persons with relevant and appropriate experience could interfere with our ability to enter into new license agreements, acquire new technologies or otherwise meet our strategic objectives.\nThe success of our cybersecurity business depends in part upon our ability to retain the best legal counsel to represent us in patent litigation and our ability to manage the costs of such services.\nThe success of our licensing and enforcement business depends upon our ability to retain the best legal counsel to advise us and manage our enforcement and litigation activities and our ability to manage the costs of such services. As our licensing and enforcement actions increase, it may become more difficult to find the best legal counsel to handle our active litigation cases, as conflicts may prevent them from representing us. Also, since the cost of litigation can be very uncertain, we may underestimate the cost of legal counsel and related activities, in relation to the value of the enforcement activity.\nFederal courts are becoming more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer and becoming more costly.\nSince patent disputes involving infringement, validity, and enforceability are governed by federal law, our patent enforcement actions are decided within the federal court system. The federal court calendars are often congested with other civil and criminal proceedings, giving rise to the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions. Such delays may have a negative impact on resolution of our disputes, adversely affect the timing of our cash flow projections and, therefore, have a negative impact on our business. Further, lengthening of the litigation process increases the cost of litigation thereby harming our business.\nAny reductions in the funding of the USPTO could have an adverse impact on the cost of processing pending patent applications and the value of those pending patent applications.\nOur business plan includes the possible acquisition of patent applications pending before the USPTO. The value of any patent application we acquire will be dependent upon the issuance of patents in a timely manner, and any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could materially delay the process by which the USPTO issues patents and consequently any income that may be derived for the technologies claimed in the patent application. Further, reductions in funding from Congress could result in higher patent application filing and maintenance fees charged by the USPTO, causing an unexpected increase in our expenses.\nCompetition for patent rights and patent portfolios is intense.\nWe expect to encounter significant competition in the areas of cybersecurity technology and intellectual property acquisitions. This includes a growing number of competitors seeking to acquire the same companies or similar patents and technologies that we may seek to acquire. We also compete with venture capital firms, strategic corporate buyers and various industry leaders for technology acquisitions and licensing opportunities.\nThe markets served by our cybersecurity technologies are subject to rapid technological change, and if we are unable to acquire new technologies and patents, our ability to generate income could be substantially impaired.\nThe markets served by our cybersecurity technologies and our licensees frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Cybersecurity products are based on continually evolving consumer demands. This will require continued efforts and success in acquiring new patent portfolios with licensing and enforcement opportunities. If we are unable to acquire new patented technologies and patent portfolios, or to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards, our ability to generate income could be substantially impaired and our business and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nOur public company disclosure obligations may have unintended adverse consequences on our licensing and patent enforcement strategy.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the disclosure and reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other applicable U.S. securities laws, as well as the rules and regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ. In order to comply with such laws, rules and regulations, we may be required to disclose certain information that may be detrimental to our current or future licensing and enforcement programs. In addition, our disclosure obligations may adversely affect our ability to enter into license or settlement agreements with third parties who are reluctant to have the monetary value and terms of such agreements publicly disclosed. In such instances, we may seek confidential treatment of certain information reflected in our license or settlement agreements, which requests may be denied by the SEC or limited to a greater extent than requested, which would harm our relationship with current and future licensees. Also, we may incur additional costs and expenses seeking confidential treatment of certain information reflected in such license or settlement agreements, which would negatively impact our operations.\nNew legislation, regulations, executive orders, or rules related to obtaining patents or enforcing patents could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease our income.\nIf new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the USPTO, other regulatory agencies or the courts, or if the President of the United States issues executive orders that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could materially and negatively affect our revenue and expenses. For example, relatively new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement or limitations on the ability to bring patent enforcement claims could negatively impact our income derived from such enforcement actions. Similarly, recent judicial decisions relating to fee shifting in patent infringement actions and limitations relating to software patents may make patent licensing and enforcement activities more difficult and costly, though it is unclear what the precise impact of these judicial decisions will be.\nFurthermore, U.S. patent laws have been amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the AIA, certain sections of which became effective in September 2011. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the AIA changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought individually against parties allegedly infringing by their respective allegations of infringement. In practice, however, many courts have consolidated separate actions asserting the same patent for the purposes of case management and discovery, although individual trials remain separate. In addition, accused infringers may now choose to attack patent validity by instituting an IPR process before the PTAB. In 2015, in In Re Cuozzo Speed Techs., 793 F.3d 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2015), the Federal Circuit upheld a decision permitting the PTAB to evaluate patent claims under a \u201cbroadest reasonable interpretation\u201d standard. This standard used by the PTAB is higher than the \u201cplain and ordinary meaning\u201d standard used in federal district courts, and has led to an arguably higher incidence of the PTAB finding claims invalid in light of prior art. In January 2016, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal on this issue as well as the issue of what decisions by the PTAB are appealable to the traditional appellate court system. It remains unclear what, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our patent monetization and enforcement business. However, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn September 2013, the United States Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") announced that it was planning to gather information from approximately 25 companies that are in the business of buying and asserting patents in order to develop a better understanding of how those companies do business and impact innovation and competition. The FTC released its study in October 2016. One of the outcomes of such study is the FTC\u2019s proposed reforms to:\n\u2022\nAddress the imbalances between the cost of litigation discovery for plaintiffs asserting patents and defendants defending their patents;\n\u2022\nprovide the courts and defendants with more information about the plaintiffs that have filed infringement lawsuits;\n\u2022\nstreamline multiple cases brought against defendants on the same theories of infringement; and\n\u2022\nprovide sufficient notice of these infringement theories as courts continue to develop heightened pleading requirements for patent cases.\nWe are still analyzing how such reforms could affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.\nFurthermore, in various pending litigation and appeals in the United States Federal courts, various arguments and legal theories are being advanced to potentially limit the scope of damages a patent licensing company might be entitled to. Any one of these pending cases could result in new legal doctrines that could make our existing or future patent portfolios less valuable or more costly to enforce.\nOn April 29, 2014, the United States Supreme Court (\"Supreme Court\") issued a decision, Octane Fitness, LLC v. Icon Health & Fitness, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1749 (2014), relaxing the standard for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing parties in patent cases. While the Supreme Court maintained the standard that a case must be deemed \u201cexceptional\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, it held that district courts were to consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d in making that determination, that it was not necessary for a court to find independently sanctionable conduct or both objective baselessness and subjective bad faith, and that clear and convincing evidence was not required. Although we are committed to litigating our patent cases in the court room with the highest standard of professional conduct and on the merits of our claims, litigation is unpredictable. We, therefore, cannot guarantee that we will prevail in our litigation matters or that we will not be ordered to pay the prevailing party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, which may be substantial.\nOn June 19, 2014, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision in which it significantly tightened the standard for patentability of software patents. Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int\u2019l, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014). Specifically, the Supreme Court stated that if you have an idea so abstract that it cannot be patented, simply tying it to a \u201cgeneric computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\u201d The Supreme Court further stated that tying the abstract idea to \u201cpurely functional and generic\u201d hardware would, similarly, not make the idea patentable. Arguably, the Alice decision is intended to limit the validity of poor quality software patents. The Alice decision may provide accused infringers of software patents new arguments to challenge the validity of such patents. Practically, the effects of the Alice decision are still being assessed as patent holders, attorneys, the USPTO, and courts, are trying to determine the proper bounds of the Alice decision. We cannot guarantee that the Alice decision and ensuing developments will not have a negative impact on our business.\nOn June 16, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\"Federal Circuit\") issued an opinion which may lead to more patents being challenged on indefiniteness grounds. Williamson v. Citrix Online, LLC, 792 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2015). One type of patent claim is a \u201cmeans-plus-function\u201d claim. Section 112(f) of the Patent Act requires that means-plus-function claims include a \u201ccorresponding structure,\u201d described in the specification, for performing the function. Previous cases had held that if a claim did not include the word \u201cmeans,\u201d there was a strong presumption that the requirements of section 112(f) did not apply. The Williamson court removed the word \u201cstrong\u201d from the presumption, as well as the requirement for a heightened evidentiary showing. Williamson may result in an increase in accused infringers challenging patent claims on indefiniteness grounds. Such result could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFurther, and in general, it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become enacted as laws. Compliance with any new or existing laws or regulations could be difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to risks of natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism or widespread illness, any one of which could result in a business stoppage and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facility, computer systems and personnel, which are primarily located in East Palo Alto. Our business operations are in close proximity to known earthquake fault zones. Our facility and transportation for our employees are susceptible to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters such as fires, floods and similar events. Should earthquakes or other catastrophes such as fires, floods, power outages, communication failures or similar events disable our facilities, we do not have readily available alternative facilities from which we could conduct our business, which stoppage could have a negative effect on our operating results. Acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war could also have a negative effect at our international and domestic facilities and on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market value of our stock has, in the past, and may, in the future, not meet the minimum Market Value of Listed Securities (\u201cMVLS\u201d) for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAs previously reported on our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 22, 2016, on December 16, 2016, we received a letter from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notifying us that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2), as the Company\u2019s market value of listed securities (\u201cMVLS\u201d) was below $35 million for the previous 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has a period of 180 calendar days, or until June 14, 2017, to regain compliance with the minimum MVLS requirement. To regain compliance, the Company\u2019s MVLS must close at $35 million or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180 calendar day compliance period.\nAt the expiration of the 180-day grace period, if we have not regained compliance with the minimum MVLS requirement, we may request a hearing to remain on the NASDAQ Capital Market. If we do not regain compliance by the end of the 180-day grace period or are not granted a hearing, Nasdaq will notify us that our common stock will be subject to delisting.\nThere can be no assurance that we will maintain or regain compliance with the requirements for listing our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market or that we would be granted a hearing. Delisting from Nasdaq would likely cause our stock to become even more thinly traded, making it more difficult for stockholders to sell large blocks of shares and for us to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the loss of analyst coverage, the loss of confidence by investors, increased employee turnover, and the inability to timely close licensing and other business transactions required for the growth of our business.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates, and others who beneficially own at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and their affiliates, together with others who own at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, beneficially own or control approximately 65% of our common stock. Accordingly, these persons, acting individually or as a group, will have substantial influence over the outcome of a corporate action requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. These stockholders may also exert influence in delaying or preventing a change in control of our company, even if such change in control would benefit our other stockholders. In addition, the significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the market value of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nFuture sales by us or our existing stockholders could dilute our stockholders and depress the market price of our common stock.\nBased on information contained in a Schedule 13D/A filed on February 14, 2017 and in Form 4 filings made in January and March 2017, two of our significant stockholders sold approximately 137,000 shares and 20,000 shares , respectively, of our common stock in the past fifteen months. While it is not easy to quantify how such sales may have depressed our share price, if these stockholders continue to sell, or other existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, or if we sell additional common stock or securities that are convertible into common stock, in the future, the market price of our common stock could decline. Further, even the perception in the public market that we or our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the issuance of additional shares by us, including the issuance of 2,196,836 shares of our common stock underlying outstanding stock options and restricted stock units, 1,229,704 of which were vested as of December 31, 2016, could dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership and voting interests in the Company and increase the number of shares of our common stock eligible for resale in the public market. Further, our board of directors recently approved an increase in the number of shares reserved under our 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan (\u201c2014 Plan\u201d). While such increase under the 2014 Plan is subject to approval of our stockholders, following such approval, the issuance of shares of our common stock underlying stock options and restricted stock units to be issued following such increase will dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership and voting interests in the Company and increase the number of shares of our common stock eligible for resale in the public market.\nOur Common Stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations, which could adversely impact the value of our Common Stock.\nThere currently is only limited trading of our common stock.\nThe stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies with securities traded in those markets. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies\u2019 stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance.\nMarket prices for public companies whose principle revenues are derived from the licensing of intellectual property have been particularly volatile. We believe that various factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, and the factors include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results compared to market expectations;\n\u2022\nour raising or failure to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nthe risk of our inability to continue to meet listing requirements of the NASDAQ;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in relationships with licensees;\n\u2022\nour or our competitors\u2019 technological innovations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments in our patent enforcement actions\n\u2022\nour failure to meet or exceed securities analysts\u2019 expectations of our financial results;\n\u2022\na change in financial estimates or securities analysts\u2019 recommendations;\n\u2022\nchanges in management\u2019s or securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments and court decisions that negatively impact the ability of patent owners to protect their assets.\n\u2022\nactual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders, including any of our significant stockholders.\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nThe SEC has adopted regulations, which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share and therefore may be a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Brokers and dealers effecting transactions in \u201cpenny stock\u201d must disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to sell shares of our common stock in the future.\nOur stockholders may experience significant dilution if future equity offerings are used to fund operations or acquire complementary businesses.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of eighty million (80,000,000) shares of common stock, one hundred two thousand (102,000) shares of Series A Preferred stock and nine million eight hundred ninety-eight thousand (9,898,000) shares of blank check preferred stock. If we engage in capital raising activities in the future as we did in May 2016 (though on a non-dilutive basis), including issuances of common stock or securities that are convertible into, or exercisable for, our common stock, to fund the growth of our business, our stockholders could experience significant dilution. In addition, securities issued in connection with future financing activities or potential acquisitions may have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of our common stock. We have adopted an equity incentive plan pursuant to which equity awards may be granted to eligible employees (including our executive officers), directors and consultants, if our board of directors determines that it is in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders to do so. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of any such equity awards may result in dilution to our stockholders and adversely affect our earnings.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us, our business, our market or our competitors and, if any analysts do publish such reports, what they publish in those reports. We may not obtain analyst coverage in the future. Any analysts that do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our stock, adversely change their recommendations from time to time, and/or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors. If any analyst who may cover us in the future were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, or if analysts fail to cover us or publish reports about us at all, we could lose, or never gain, visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our operating results could be harmed. Any system of internal control over financial reporting, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. We have experienced material weaknesses in the past and we cannot be certain that in the future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered. Any weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, inability to timely file periodic reports, a decline in our stock price and investor confidence, or other material effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change the board of directors or current management and could make a third-party acquisition of our company difficult.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without the approval of our stockholders, to establish classes or series of preferred stock with such rights, privileges and preferences as our board determines (i.e., \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock), including rights that may be senior to those of our common stockholders, which could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal;\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors with staggered terms, which could delay or otherwise make it more difficult for an outsider to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation prohibits stockholders from acting by written consent or calling a special meeting, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our board of directors or to vote to repeal any of the antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation provides that directors may only be removed for cause by a supermajority vote of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nour bylaws contain advance notice provisions with respect to nominees for election to our board of directors.\nIf we issue shares of preferred stock, investments in common stock could be diluted or subordinated to the rights of the holders of preferred stock.\nOur board of directors is authorized by our Certificate of Incorporation to establish classes or series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such class or series without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Any shares of preferred stock so issued could have priority over our common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. For instance, we issued 102,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in May 2016. Under the terms of such Series A Preferred Stock, with respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall rank senior to all other classes of securities of the Company. Further, the issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable a holder to block such a transaction. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock. Although our board of directors is required to make any determination to issue preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders, our board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which such stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then-market price of such stock. Presently, our board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to the issuance of currently authorized preferred stock, unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange rules. Although we have no plans to issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to adopt any new series, preferences or other classification of preferred stock, any such action by our board of directors or issuance of preferred stock by us could dilute your investment in our common stock and warrants or subordinate your holdings to such shares of preferred stock.", "PERMNO": 91893, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "FNJN"}
