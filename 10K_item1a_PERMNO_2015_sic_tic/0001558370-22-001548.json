RISK FACTORS\nThe Corporation is subject to the many risks and uncertainties applicable to all banking companies, as well as risks specific to the Corporation\u2019s geographic locations. Although the Corporation seeks to effectively manage risks, and maintains a level of equity that exceeds the banking regulatory agencies\u2019 thresholds for being considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements), management cannot predict the future and cannot eliminate the possibility of credit, operational or other losses. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from management\u2019s expectations. Some of the Corporation\u2019s significant risks and uncertainties are discussed below.\nCoronavirus Outbreak - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions in the international and U.S. economies as well as the Corporation\u2019s local economy. The ultimate effect of COVID-19 on the local or broader economy is not known. Moreover, the Federal Reserve took action to lower the Federal Funds rate in 2020 and maintained a rate of 0% to 0.25% throughout 2021 but has recently signaled its intent to raise the rate in an effort to contain inflation. Fluctuations in interest rates triggered by the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions may negatively affect interest income and, therefore, earnings. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, and there is no guarantee that the Corporation\u2019s efforts to address the adverse impacts of the coronavirus will be effective. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of new variants of the coronavirus and actions taken to contain the coronavirus or its impact.\nThe effect of COVID-19 and related events, including those described above and those not yet known or knowable, could have a negative effect on the Corporation\u2019s business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as a result of quarantines; market volatility; market downturns; changes in consumer behavior; business closures; deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers or the inability of borrowers to satisfy their obligations (and any related forbearances or restructurings that may be implemented); changes in the value of collateral securing outstanding loans; changes in the value of the investment securities portfolio; effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating the Corporation\u2019s financial reporting and internal controls; and declines in the demand for loans and other banking services and products.\nRisk Related to Acquisition Activity - As described in Item 1, the Corporation has completed two acquisitions of banking companies over the past two years (Covenant and Monument) and expanded its geographic footprint to Southeastern and Southcentral Pennsylvania. Further, management intends to continue to pursue additional acquisition opportunities. Potential acquisitions may disrupt the\nCorporation\u2019s business and dilute shareholder value. We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial service companies. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, potential disruption to the Corporation\u2019s business, potential diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company. Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of the Corporation\u2019s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from recent or future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nCredit Risk from Lending Activities - A significant source of risk is the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. Most of the Corporation\u2019s loans are secured, but some loans are unsecured. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans may be insufficient to cover the obligations owed under such loans. Collateral values may be adversely affected by changes in economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, wide-spread disease, terrorist activity, environmental contamination and other external events. In addition, collateral appraisals that are out of date or that do not meet industry recognized standards may create the impression that a loan is adequately collateralized when it is not. The Corporation has adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and policies, including regular reviews of appraisals and borrower financial statements, that management believes are appropriate to mitigate the risk of loss. Also, as discussed further in the \u201cProvision and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis, the Corporation attempts to estimate the amount of losses that may be inherent in the portfolio through a quarterly evaluation process that includes several members of management and that addresses specifically identified problem loans, as well as other quantitative data and qualitative factors. Such risk management and accounting policies and procedures, however, may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nInterest Rate Risk - Business risk arising from changes in interest rates is an inherent factor in operating a banking organization. The Corporation\u2019s assets are predominantly long-term, fixed-rate loans and debt securities. Funding for these assets comes principally from deposits with no stated maturities, term deposits and borrowed funds. Accordingly, there is an inherent risk of lower future earnings or decline in fair value of the Corporation\u2019s financial instruments when interest rates change. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nLimited Geographic Diversification - The Corporation grants commercial, residential and personal loans to customers primarily in the Corporation\u2019s legacy markets of the Northern tier/Northcentral regions of Pennsylvania and Southern tier of New York and in Southeastern and Southcentral Pennsylvania. Although the Corporation has a diversified loan portfolio, a significant portion of its debtors\u2019 ability to honor their contracts is dependent on the local economic conditions within these regions. Deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect the quality of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio and the demand for its products and services, and accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nCompetition - All phases of the Corporation\u2019s business are competitive. Some competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization than the Corporation, have greater access to capital markets and can offer a broader array of financial services. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to compete effectively in its markets. Furthermore, developments increasing the nature or level of competition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nInability to Attract and Develop Qualified Personnel - The Corporation believes that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified management, lending, financial, technological, marketing, sales, and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our ability to retain key officers and employees may be further impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry. For example, legislation and bank regulatory action that places restrictions on executive compensation at, and the pay practices of, financial institutions may further impact our ability to compete for talent with other industries\nthat are not subject to the same limitations as financial institutions. Any inability to attract, develop and retain significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCyber Security Risks and Technology Dependence - In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in systems and on networks. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to operations and our business strategy.\nThe Corporation has invested in accepted technologies, and continually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect our networks, computers and data from damage or unauthorized access, and maintains an information security risk insurance policy. On an on-going basis the Corporation assesses its cyber security procedures and controls and performs network penetration tests on at least an annual basis. All employees receive monthly information security awareness training.\nDespite these security measures, the Corporation\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure or those of third parties used by us to compile, process or store such information may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged or disclosed. A breach in security could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to the Corporation\u2019s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nGovernment Regulation and Monetary Policy - The Corporation and the banking industry are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The requirements and limitations imposed by such laws and regulations limit the way the Corporation conducts its business, undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit the Corporation\u2019s shareholders. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is in the control of the Corporation. Significant new laws or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Further, federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affects short-term interest rates and credit conditions, and any unfavorable change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nBank Secrecy Act and Related Laws and Regulations - These laws and regulations have significant implications for all financial institutions. In recent years, they have increased due diligence requirements and reporting obligations for financial institutions, created new crimes and penalties, and required the federal banking agencies, in reviewing merger and other acquisition transactions, to consider the effectiveness of the parties to such transactions in combating money laundering activities. Even innocent noncompliance and inconsequential failure to follow the regulations could result in significant fines or other penalties, which could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh - Through its subsidiary (C&N Bank), the Corporation is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB-Pittsburgh), which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Corporation has a line of credit with the FHLB-Pittsburgh that is secured by a blanket lien on its loan portfolio. Access to this line of credit is critical if a funding need arises. However, there can be no assurance that the FHLB-Pittsburgh will be able to provide funding when needed, nor can there be assurance that the FHLB-Pittsburgh will provide funds specifically to the Corporation should its financial condition deteriorate and/or regulators prevent that access. The inability to access this source of funds could have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial flexibility if alternate financing is not available at acceptable interest rates. The failure of the FHLB-Pittsburgh or the FHLB system in general, may materially impair the Corporation\u2019s ability to meet short- and long-term liquidity needs or to meet growth plans.\nThe Corporation owns common stock of the FHLB-Pittsburgh to qualify for membership in the FHLB system and access services from the FHLB-Pittsburgh. The FHLB-Pittsburgh faces a variety of risks in its operations including interest rate risk, counterparty credit risk, and adverse changes in its regulatory framework. In addition, the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. To the extent that one FHLB cannot meet its obligations, other FHLBs can be called upon to make required payments. Such risks affecting the FHLB-Pittsburgh could adversely impact the value of the Corporation\u2019s investment in the common stock of the FHLB-Pittsburgh and/or affect its access to credit.\nSoundness of Other Financial Institutions - In addition to the FHLB-Pittsburgh, the Corporation maintains other credit facilities that provide it with additional liquidity. These facilities include secured and unsecured borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank and third-party commercial banks. The Corporation believes that it maintains a strong liquidity position and that it is well positioned to withstand foreseeable market conditions. However, legal agreements with counterparties typically include provisions allowing them to restrict or terminate the Corporation\u2019s access to these credit facilities with or without advance notice and at their sole discretion.\nFinancial institutions are interconnected because of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. Financial market conditions have been negatively impacted in the past and such disruptions or adverse changes in the Corporation\u2019s results of operations or financial condition could, in the future, have a negative impact on available sources of liquidity. Such a situation may arise due to circumstances that are outside the Corporation\u2019s control, such as general market disruptions or operational problems affecting the Corporation or third parties. The Corporation\u2019s efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated reductions in available liquidity. In such events, the Corporation\u2019s cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing net interest income, or the Corporation may need to sell a portion of its securities and/or loan portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could necessitate realizing a loss.\nSecurities Markets - The fair value of the Corporation\u2019s available-for-sale debt securities, as well as the revenues the Corporation earns from its wealth management services, are sensitive to price fluctuations and market events.\nDeclines in the values of the Corporation\u2019s securities holdings, combined with adverse changes in the expected cash flows from these investments, could result in other-than-temporary impairment charges. For additional information regarding debt securities, see the \u201cSecurities\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Corporation\u2019s trust revenue is determined, in part, from the value of the underlying investment portfolios. Accordingly, if the values of those investment portfolios decrease, whether due to factors influencing U.S. or international securities markets, in general, or otherwise, the Corporation\u2019s revenue could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Corporation\u2019s ability to sell its brokerage services is dependent, in part, upon consumers\u2019 level of confidence in securities markets.\nMortgage Banking - Since 2009, the Corporation has originated and sold residential mortgage loans to the secondary market through the MPF Xtra program. Since 2014, the Corporation has also originated and sold residential mortgage loans to the secondary market through the MPF Original program. Both of these programs are administered by the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh and Chicago. At December 31, 2021, the total outstanding balance of residential mortgages sold and serviced through the two programs amounted to $334,741,000. The Corporation must strictly adhere to the MPF Xtra and MPF Original program guidelines for origination, underwriting and servicing loans, and failure to do so may result in the Corporation being forced to repurchase loans or being dropped from the program. As of December 31, 2021, the total outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans the Corporation has repurchased as a result of identified instances of noncompliance amounted to $1,571,000. If the volume of such forced repurchases of loans were to increase significantly, or if the Corporation were to be dropped from the programs, it could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.", "PERMNO": 90534, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CZNC"}
