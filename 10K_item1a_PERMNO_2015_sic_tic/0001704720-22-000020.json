{"cik": "1704720", "company": "Cannae Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in our industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. In addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report and other filings we have made and make in the future with the SEC, you should carefully consider the following risk factors and uncertainties, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.\nRisks Relating to the Company's Structure\nWe may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe do not believe that we are subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c40 Act\u201d). We primarily acquire interests in operating companies and are engaged in actively managing and operating a core group of those companies, which we are committed to supporting for the long-term. Our officers, the Manager and any employees who provide services to us pursuant to the terms of our corporate services agreement with FNF devote their activities to these businesses. Based on these factors, we believe that we are not an investment company under the 40 Act, including under Section 3(b)(1) of the 40 Act, and we intend to continue to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. If, at any time, we become or are determined to be primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, we could become subject to regulation under the 40 Act. In these circumstances, after giving effect to any applicable grace periods, we may be required to register as an investment company, which could result in significant registration and compliance costs, could require changes to our corporate governance structure and financial reporting, and could restrict our activities going forward. In addition, if we were to become subject to the 40 Act, any violation of the 40 Act could subject us to material adverse consequences, including potentially significant regulatory penalties and the possibility that certain of our contracts would be deemed unenforceable.\nCertain executive officers and members of our Board of Directors have or will have interests and positions that could present potential conflicts.\nCertain executive officers and members of our Board serve on the boards of directors of other entities or are employed by other entities, including but not limited to D&B, Trasimene, Alight, Paysafe, FNF, Black Knight or our Active SPACs.\nAs a result of the foregoing, there may be circumstances where certain executive officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of interest with respect to, among other things: (i) our ongoing relationships with D&B, Trasimene, Alight, Paysafe, FNF or our Active SPACs; (ii) business opportunities arising for any of us, D&B, Trasimene, Alight, Paysafe, FNF, Black Knight or our Active SPACs; and (iii) conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us. For example, from time to time, we may enter into transactions with D&B, Trasimene, Alight, Paysafe, FNF or Black Knight and/or their respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company or any of our respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping director.\nWe have in place a code of business conduct and ethics prescribing procedures for managing conflicts of interest and our risk management and compliance functions and our audit committee are responsible for the review, approval or ratification of any potential conflicts of interest transactions. Additionally, we expect that interested directors will abstain from decisions with respect to conflicts of interest as a matter of practice. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective, that we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party.\nRefer to Note R to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our related party relationships and transactions with FNF and our Manager.\nRisks Relating to the Externalization and Our Manager\nThe Management Service Agreement was negotiated between related parties and the terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if it were negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.\nBecause our Manager is owned by certain of our directors and executive officers, the Management Services Agreement was developed by related parties, although our independent directors reviewed and approved the Management Services Agreement. The terms of the Management Services Agreement, including fees payable, may not reflect the terms we may have received if it was negotiated with an unrelated third party. In addition, particularly as a result of our relationship with the principal owners of the Manager, who are certain directors and members of our management team, our independent directors may determine that it is in the best interests of our shareholders not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under the Management Services Agreement because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with our Manager.\nOur executive officers, directors and Manager may allocate some of their time to other businesses, thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile the members of our management team anticipate devoting a substantial amount of their time to the affairs of the Company, our executive officers, directors, Manager and other members of our management team may engage in other business activities. This may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our management and the operations of other businesses. Their other business endeavors may involve related or unrelated parties. Conflicts of interest that arise over the allocation of time may not always be resolved in our favor and may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nConflicts of interest could arise in connection with certain of our directors\u2019 and executive officers\u2019 discharge of fiduciary duties to our shareholders.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers are members of the Manager. Such persons, by virtue of their positions with us, have fiduciary duties to us and our shareholders. The duties of such persons as directors or executive officers to us and our shareholders may conflict with the interests of such persons in their capacities as members or employees of the Manager.\nOur Manager and members of our management team may engage in activities that compete with us or our businesses.\nWhile the members of our management team intend to devote a substantial majority of their time to the affairs of the Company, and while our Manager currently does not manage any other businesses that are in lines of business similar to our businesses, neither our management team nor our Manager is expressly prohibited from investing in or managing other entities, including those that are in the same or similar line of business as our businesses, or required to present any particular acquisition or business opportunity to the Company. In this regard, the Management Services Agreement and the obligation thereunder to provide management services to us will not create a mutually exclusive relationship between our Manager, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other.\nWe cannot remove our Manager solely for poor performance, which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nUnder the terms of the Management Services Agreement, our Manager may not be removed as a result of underperformance. Instead, the Company may only remove our Manager in certain limited circumstances or upon a vote by a majority of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to terminate the Management Services Agreement. This limitation could adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nOur Manager can resign on 180 days\u2019 notice, subject to a limited extension, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as the market price of our shares.\nOur Manager has the right, under the Management Services Agreement, to resign at any time on 180 days\u2019 written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not, subject to the Company\u2019s right to extend such period by an additional 180 days or until a replacement manager has been in place for 30 days, if no replacement manager has been found by the 150th day following the Manager\u2019s notice of resignation. If our Manager resigns, we may not be able to contract with a new manager or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 180 days (subject to possible extension), or at all, in which case our operations are likely to experience a disruption; our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected; and the market price of our shares may decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management, acquisition activities and supervision of our businesses is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our Manager. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our businesses may result in additional costs and time delays that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nWe must pay our Manager the management fee regardless of our performance.\nOur Manager is entitled to receive a management fee that is based on our cost of invested capital, as defined in the Management Services Agreement, regardless of the performance of our businesses. The calculation of the management fee is unrelated to the Company\u2019s results of operations. As a result, the management fee may incentivize our Manager to increase the amount of invested capital.\nWe cannot determine the amount of the management fee that will be paid over time with any certainty, nor are we able to determine with any certainty the amount of carried interest that will be paid over time, and our payment of such fees and carried interest to the Manager may significantly reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nUnder the Management Services Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay a management fee to and, subject to certain exceptions, reimburse the costs and out-of-pocket expenses of our Manager incurred on behalf of the Company in connection with the provision of services to the Company. The management fee is calculated by reference to the Company\u2019s cost of invested capital, which will be impacted by the acquisition or disposition of, and additional capital contributions and investments in, businesses, which can be significantly influenced by our Manager, as well as the performance of our businesses and other businesses we may acquire in the future. Changes in cost of invested capital and in the resulting management fee could be significant, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, if the performance of the Company declines, assuming cost of invested capital remains the same, management fees will increase as a percentage of the Company\u2019s net income.\nFurthermore, we cannot determine the amount of carried interest with respect to liquidity events involving the Company's businesses that will be paid over time with any certainty. Such determination would be dependent on the potential sale proceeds received for any of our businesses and the performance of the Company and its businesses over a multi-year period of time, among other factors that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. Such factors may have a significant impact on the amount of any carried interest to be paid to the Manager. Likewise, such determination would be dependent on whether certain hurdles were surpassed giving rise to a payment of carried interest.\nWhile it is difficult to quantify with any certainty the actual amount of any such payments in the future, such amounts could be substantial. The management fee and carried interest will be payment obligations of the Company and, as a result, will be paid, along with other Company obligations, prior to the payment of distributions to shareholders. As a result the payment of these amounts may significantly reduce the amount of cash flow available for distribution to our shareholders. If we do not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the management fee when such payments are due, we may be required to liquidate assets or incur debt in order to make such payments. This circumstance could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nOur profit allocation may induce our Manager to make suboptimal decisions regarding our operations.\nOur Manager will receive carried interest based on profits in excess of an annualized hurdle rate upon a liquidity event involving a Company investment. In this respect, a calculation and payment of carried interest may be triggered upon the sale of one of our businesses. As a result, our Manager may be incentivized to recommend the sale of one or more of our businesses to our Board of Directors at a time that may not be optimal for our shareholders.\nRisks Relating to the Restaurant Group\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the business of our Restaurant Group, which has and could continue to materially affect our Restaurant Group's operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for an extended period of time.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak, the federal, state and local government responses to COVID-19 and our responses to the outbreak have all disrupted and will continue to disrupt our Restaurant Group businesses. In the United States, individuals are being encouraged to practice social distancing, in most places are restricted from gathering in groups and in many cases, placed on complete restriction from non-essential movements outside of their homes. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak and these changing conditions, we closed the dining rooms in substantially all of our restaurants in late March 2020 with substantially all remaining closed through early May 2020. During such time, most of our restaurants were solely operating to-go and delivery services in the jurisdictions where government regulations permit restaurants to continue to operate and where the guest demand made such operations sustainable. We temporarily closed certain restaurants, modified work hours for our Restaurant Group employees and identified and implemented cost savings measures throughout our Restaurant Group operations. If the COVID-19 outbreak arises again as a result of new variants, we may again be required to close the dining rooms in substantially all of our restaurants and solely operate to-go and delivery services, which would further adversely affect the results of operations of our Restaurant Group.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and these responses have affected and, with the unpredictable impact of future variants of COVID-19 and related government responses to any future outbreaks, may continue to adversely affect our Restaurant Group brands' guest traffic, sales and operating costs and we cannot predict how long the outbreak will last or what other government responses may occur.\nSuppliers of our Restaurant Group could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. If our Restaurant Group's suppliers\u2019 access to resources is constrained or their employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our Restaurant Group businesses could\nface shortages of food items or other restaurant supplies and our Restaurant Group's operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the historical financial results of our Restaurant Group and depending on the duration and scope, such impact could have a material adverse impact on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSee further discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our Restaurant Group's results in the Results of Operations subsection in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report.\nThe Restaurant Group companies face significant competition for customers, real estate and employees and competitive pressure to adapt to changes in conditions driving customer demand. The Restaurant Group companies' inability to compete effectively may affect guest counts, sales and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive with a substantial number of restaurant operators that compete directly and indirectly with the Restaurant Group companies with respect to price, service, ambiance, brand, customer service, dining experience, location, food quality and variety and value perception of menu items and there are other well established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than the Restaurant Group companies. Some of our Restaurant Group companies' competitors advertise on national television, which may provide customers with greater awareness and name recognition than our Restaurant Group companies can achieve through their advertising efforts. There is also active competition for management personnel and attractive suitable real estate sites. Consumer tastes and perceptions, nutritional and dietary trends, guest count patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants often affect the restaurant business, and our Restaurant Group companies' competitors may react more efficiently and effectively to those conditions. For instance, prevailing health or dietary preferences or perceptions of our Restaurant Group companies' products may cause consumers to avoid certain menu items or products our Restaurant Group companies offer in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy, and such choices by consumers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our Restaurant Group companies face growing competition from the supermarket industry, with the improvement of their \"convenient meals\" in the deli and prepared food sections, from quick service and fast casual restaurants and online food delivery services as a result of food and beverage offerings by those food providers. As our Restaurant Group companies' competitors expand operations in markets where our restaurant businesses operate or expect to operate, we expect competition to intensify. If our Restaurant Group companies are unable to continue to compete effectively, their guest counts, sales and profit margins could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased commodity, energy and other costs could decrease our Restaurant Group companies' profit margins or cause the Restaurant Group companies to limit or otherwise modify their menus, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost, availability and quality of ingredients restaurant operations use to prepare their food is subject to a range of factors, many of which are beyond their control. A significant component of our restaurant businesses' costs will be related to food commodities, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, poultry, dairy products, oils, produce, fruit, flour and other related costs such as energy and transportation over which we may have little control, that can be subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, changes in international commodity markets and other factors. If there is a substantial increase in prices for these commodities, our Restaurant Group companies' results of operations may be negatively affected. In addition, the Restaurant Group companies' restaurants are dependent upon frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet certain specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality, and cost of ingredients, which would likely lower revenues, damage the Restaurant Group companies' reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nNegative customer experiences or negative publicity surrounding our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or other restaurants could adversely affect sales in one or more of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants and make our concepts less valuable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we believe our Restaurant Group companies' success depends significantly on their ability to provide exceptional food quality, outstanding service and an excellent overall dining experience, adverse publicity, whether or not accurate, relating to food quality, public health concerns, illness, safety, injury or government or industry findings concerning our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants, restaurants operated by other food service providers or others across the food industry supply chain could affect our Restaurant Group companies more than it would other restaurants that compete primarily on price or other factors. If customers perceive or experience a reduction in the food quality, service or ambiance at our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants or in any way believe our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants have failed to deliver a consistently\npositive experience, the value and popularity of one or more of our Restaurant Group companies' concepts could suffer. Further, because our restaurant businesses rely heavily on \"word-of-mouth,\" as opposed to more conventional mediums of advertisement, to establish concept recognition, our restaurant businesses may be more adversely affected by negative customer experiences than other dining establishments, including those of our restaurant businesses' competitors.\nOur restaurant businesses could suffer due to reduced demand for our restaurant businesses' brands or specific menu offerings if our restaurant businesses are the subject of negative publicity or litigation regarding allegations of food-related contaminations or illnesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFood safety is a top priority, and our Restaurant Group companies dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that their customers enjoy safe, quality food products. Food-related contaminations and illnesses may be caused by a variety of food-borne pathogens, such as E. coli or salmonella, which are frequently carried on unwashed fruits and vegetables, from a variety of illnesses transmitted by restaurant workers, such as hepatitis A, which may not be diagnosed prior to being infectious, and from contamination of food by foreign substances. Contamination and food borne illness incidents could also be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers and distributors. As a result, we cannot control all of the potential sources of contamination or illness that can be contained in or transmitted from our Restaurant Group companies' food. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our Restaurant Group companies' restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our Restaurant Group companies' brands and have a negative impact on their sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our Restaurant Group companies' competitors or at one of our Restaurant Group companies' suppliers could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our Restaurant Group companies' sales.\nIf any person becomes injured or ill, or alleges becoming injured or ill, as a result of eating our Restaurant Group companies' food, our Restaurant Group companies may temporarily close some restaurants or their bakery facilities, which would decrease their revenues, and our restaurant businesses may be liable for damages or be subject to governmental regulatory action, either of which could have long-lasting, negative effects on our restaurant businesses' reputation, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether our restaurant businesses are found liable. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.\nThe success of the Restaurant Group depends, in part, on its intellectual property, which we may be unable to protect.\nWe regard our Restaurant Group's service marks, including \"O'Charley's,\" \"Ninety Nine\" and other service marks and trademarks as important factors in the marketing of our restaurants. We have also obtained trademarks for several of our brands' menu items and for various advertising slogans. We are aware of names and marks similar to our Restaurant Group's service marks and trademarks used by other persons in certain geographic areas where we have restaurants. Our policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks.\nRisk Relating to Dun & Bradstreet\nD&B could lose its access to data sources or ability to transfer data across the data sources in markets it operates, which could prevent D&B from providing its solutions.\nD&B's solutions depend extensively upon continued access to and receipt of data from external sources, including data received from clients, strategic partners and various government and public records repositories. In some cases, D&B competes with its data providers. D&B's data providers could stop providing data, provide untimely data or increase the costs for their data for a variety of reasons, including a perception that its systems are unsecure as a result of a data security incidents, budgetary constraints, a desire to generate additional revenue or for regulatory or competitive reasons. For example, the ability of D&B's data providers to process and analyze such data may be constrained by government mandates to work remotely. In 2021, following a 2020 ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union in its Case 311/18 Data Protection Commission v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems (Schrems II), European regulators and the European Commission adopted prescriptive measures for assessing and demonstrating that all cross-border data transfers comply with the ruling. Additionally, in 2021, China adopted its own restrictions on cross-border data transfers under its new DSL and PIPL data compliance laws. As a result of these developments and related regulatory decisions, D&B has become and may become subject to further increased restrictions or mandates on the collection, disclosure or use or transfer of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by D&B's providers in a way that allows it to legally use the data or cannot be transferred out of the country where it has been collected. D&B may not be successful in maintaining its relationships with these external data source providers or be able to continue to obtain data from them on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, D&B may not able to obtain data from alternative sources if its current sources become unavailable. If D&B were to lose access to this external data or if its access or use were restricted or were to become less economical or desirable, D&B's ability to provide solutions could be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Paysafe\nPaysafe\u2019s focus on specialized industry verticals can increase its risks relative to other companies in its industry.\nPaysafe focuses on specialized and high-risk industry verticals, including iGaming (which encompasses a broad selection of online betting related to sports, esports, fantasy sports, poker and other casino games), digital trading, cryptocurrencies, nutraceuticals, Cannabidiol (CBD) products and multi-level marketing. Although this focus distinguishes Paysafe from industry peers, it also increases risks inherent in its business and broader industry. For example:\n\u2022the industry verticals Paysafe serves are extensively regulated, and their regulation is evolving and subject to frequent change and uncertain interpretation. As a result of regulatory action, Paysafe has had to exit a market altogether, limit services it provides, or otherwise modify its business in ways that have adversely impacted profitability. Paysafe is also exposed to a higher risk of losses resulting from related investigations, regulatory actions and litigation.;\n\u2022serving these high-risk industry verticals routinely creates greater operational complexity, including for Paysafe\u2019s compliance, legal and risk functions;\n\u2022with respect to certain industry verticals (such as CBD or iGaming), the laws related to, or the legal status of, such verticals vary significantly among the countries in which Paysafe operates and, in the U.S., from state to state, further adding operational complexity particularly in compliance and risk mitigation;\n\u2022Paysafe may have difficulty obtaining or maintaining relationships with merchants and third-party service providers for its business, such as banks and payment card networks, including as a result of their assessment and appetite for the compliance, cost, government regulation, risk of consumer fraud or public pressure that can be associated with some of the specialized industry verticals that Paysafe operates in. For example, merchants may compel Paysafe to change their operations or add bespoke or enhanced internal controls in order to do business with them; and\n\u2022from time to time, the industry verticals Paysafe serves (and Paysafe by association) are the subject of negative publicity, which can harm Paysafe\u2019s brand and deter consumers and merchants from adopting its products and services and influence its\u2019 third-party service providers\u2019 assessment of its\u2019 business.\nThe enhanced risks resulting from Paysafe\u2019s specialized focus can materialize suddenly and without warning, which may result in increased volatility in its\u2019 results of operations compared with other companies in its\u2019 industry that do not provide services to companies in high-risk industry verticals, and could result in a material adverse effect on Paysafe\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nPaysafe is vulnerable to the effects of chargebacks, merchant insolvency and consumer deposit settlement risk.\nPaysafe is exposed to the effect of chargebacks and merchant insolvency in its integrated processing business. In that business, Paysafe is liable to various acquiring banks for chargebacks incurred by its merchants where the merchants are unable to meet liabilities arising as a result of those chargebacks. If the average chargeback rate on any of Paysafe\u2019s merchant portfolios at any acquiring bank exceeds the maximum average chargeback rate permitted by the card agreements, Paysafe will be required to take steps to reduce the average chargeback rate so that it falls below the maximum permitted rate or risk losing its relationship with that acquiring bank. Those steps might include processing more transactions for merchants who have lower chargeback rates to produce a lower average chargeback rate for the portfolio as a whole or terminating relationships with merchants who have higher chargeback rates, which could in turn lead to a material loss of revenue for Paysafe. Chargebacks may arise as individual claims or as multiple claims relating to the same facts or circumstances. For example, the insolvency or cessation of a merchant doing business could cause numerous individual customers to bring claims at once which, either singly or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on Paysafe\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and future prospects. Similarly, chargebacks or fraud related to Paysafe\u2019s customers or merchants in its digital wallet business could cause the payment card schemes of which Paysafe is a member in Europe to require Paysafe to implement additional and potentially costly controls, and ultimately disqualify it from processing transactions if satisfactory controls are not maintained. Further, if any of the services Paysafe offers are deemed to have caused or contributed to illegal activity, customers, consumer protection agencies and regulatory firms could band together to initiate chargeback card payments or ACH reversals for transactions associated with the activity in question.\nIn Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet business, Paysafe offers its merchants a \"no chargeback policy.\" A chargeback is the return of funds to a customer and in this context relates to a reversal of unauthorized charges to a customer\u2019s credit card, for example, as a result of fraud or identity theft. Under Paysafe\u2019s \"no chargeback policy,\" Paysafe agrees to allow merchants who qualify under its vetting policy to retain all monies received from its\u2019 NETELLER and Skrill Digital wallet holders and undertake not to request reimbursement from such merchants in respect of chargebacks incurred. In such cases, the full amount of the disputed transaction is charged back to Paysafe and its credit card processor may levy additional fees against Paysafe unless they can successfully challenge the chargeback. Paysafe believes that its \"no chargeback policy\" is a key factor in a merchant\u2019s decision to use its digital wallet services.\nPaysafe\u2019s businesses are also subject to merchant credit risk in respect of non-payment for products provided and services rendered or non-reimbursement of costs incurred. The contracts Paysafe enters into may require significant expenditure prior to merchant payments and may expose Paysafe to potential credit risk or may require Paysafe to use its available bank facilities in order to meet payment obligations.\nAdditionally, Paysafe is exposed to risk associated with the settlement of consumer deposits. Digital wallet deposits from financial institutions, such as bank accounts, are credited to customer accounts before settlement of funds is received. Thus, there is a risk that the funds may not be settled or may be recalled due to insufficient funds or fraud reasons, exposing Paysafe to the risk of negative customer wallet balances and bad debt. Further, digital wallet prepaid card deposits or transactions made by consumers may be charged back by consumers resulting in a negative balance and loss on Paysafe\u2019s accounts. If Paysafe is unable to effectively manage and monitor these risks, they could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nPaysafe may become an unwitting party to fraud or be deemed to be handling proceeds resulting from the criminal activity of its customers.\nPaysafe is focused on providing trusted services to its customers and merchants and ensuring that data and confidential information is transmitted and stored securely. Combating money laundering and fraud is a significant challenge in the online payment services industry because transactions are conducted between parties who are not physically present, which in turn creates opportunities for misrepresentation and abuse. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as identity theft, fraud and paper instrument counterfeiting. Online payment companies are especially vulnerable because of the convenience, immediacy and in some cases anonymity of transferring funds from one account to another and subsequently withdrawing them. The highly automated nature of, and liquidity offered by, Paysafe\u2019s payments services make it a target for illegal or improper uses, including fraudulent or illegal sales of goods or services, money laundering and terrorist financing. Allegations of fraud may result in fines, settlements, litigation expenses and reputational damage.\nWhile Paysafe employs a variety of tools to protect against fraud, these tools may not be successful. Paysafe reserves the right to refuse to accept accounts or transactions from many high-risk countries, internet protocol addresses and e-mail domains and continually update these screening filters. Paysafe\u2019s transaction monitoring systems are designed to identify various criteria, including the country of origination, in order to detect and monitor fraud and to reject any purported transactions if they appear to be fraudulent. Nevertheless, Paysafe\u2019s transaction monitoring systems may not operate as intended or may otherwise fail to effectively detect fraudulent transactions or locate where a transaction is being made. Paysafe faces significant risks of loss due to money laundering, fraud and disputes between senders and recipients, and if Paysafe is unable to deal effectively with losses from fraudulent transactions its business could be materially harmed.\nThe ability for customers to withdraw and deposit funds within various accounts and the potential for customer fraud in connection with certain gambling activities heightens the risks of money laundering and the unwitting receipt by Paysafe of criminal proceeds. Paysafe\u2019s industry is under increasing scrutiny from governmental authorities-in Europe, the United States and many other jurisdictions in which it operates-in connection with the potential for consumer fraud. The laws of some jurisdictions define or interpret what constitutes the underlying criminal activity that gives rise to criminal proceeds relatively narrowly (for example, terrorist financing). Conversely, other jurisdictions have adopted laws providing for relatively broad definitions or interpretations of underlying criminal activity (for example, in the UK criminal proceeds may arise from the conviction of any criminal offense where it is found that the defendant has benefited from the criminal conduct). Further, to the extent to which payment processors may be held civilly or criminally liable for the criminal activities of its merchant customers also varies widely across the jurisdictions in which Paysafe operates.\nIf consumer fraud levels involving Paysafe\u2019s services were to rise, it could lead to regulatory intervention and reputational and financial damage. This, in turn, could lead to additional government enforcement actions and investigations and concerns raised by merchants and Paysafe\u2019s banking partners, which in turn could reduce the use and acceptance of Paysafe\u2019s services or increase its compliance costs and thereby have a material adverse impact on its\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations. By processing payments for merchants and customers in certain industry vehicles, such as those engaged in the online gambling sector, Paysafe may be deemed to be handling proceeds of crime in the jurisdiction where its merchants and customers are located. Paysafe is subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including, in the United States, the BSA which requires money services businesses such as Paysafe to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records. Paysafe has adopted a program to comply with these and other anti-money laundering regulations, but any errors or failure to implement the program properly could lead to lawsuits, administrative action and government fines and/or prosecution. In addition, even if Paysafe complies with such reporting and record-keeping requirements, law enforcement agencies in the relevant country could seize merchants\u2019 or customers\u2019 funds that are the proceeds of unlawful activity. Any such action could result in adverse publicity for Paysafe\u2019s business and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nRisks Relating to the Split-Off\nWe may incur material costs as a result of our separation from FNF, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our separation from FNF, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs and expenses not previously incurred. These increased costs and expenses may arise from various factors, including financial reporting or costs associated with complying with the federal securities laws (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, tax administration and human resources related functions.) FNF provided many of these services for us at no-cost (other than reimbursement of FNF's out-of-pocket costs and expenses) under the Corporate Services Agreement (the \"CSA\"), dated as of November 17, 2017, by and between us and FNF until November 2020. In October 2020, we entered into an Extension of Corporate Services Agreement (the \"Extension\") with FNF. Pursuant to the Extension, the term of the CSA is extended for two years until November 17, 2022 (the \"Extended Term\"). During the Extended Term, FNF will provide certain corporate services to Cannae at FNF\u2019s Standard Allocation (as defined in the CSA), plus 10%, and Cannae agrees to pay or reimburse FNF for any fees, costs or other expenses paid by FNF to third parties in connection with the corporate services. The CSA will automatically renew for successive one-year terms, unless the parties mutually agree to terminate the CSA at least 30 days prior to the applicable termination date. No later than 30 days prior to such termination date, the parties shall negotiate mutually agreeable arm\u2019s length terms for each additional one-year term.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not incur third-party vendor costs or out-of-pocket expenses under the CSA that are material to our business. Moreover, we will have to develop internal departments/functions to perform the services at the end of the term of the CSA. Through the date of this Annual Report, we have developed internal departments/functions for most of the services previously provided by FNF pursuant to the CSA, but we still rely on FNF for certain functions including information technology security.\nOur agreements with FNF were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of FNF.\nWe have a number of agreements with FNF covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by FNF for certain of our businesses. In addition, we have entered into (i) the CSA, (ii) a voting agreement with FNF, pursuant to which FNF agrees to appear or cause all shares of Cannae Holdings common stock that FNF or its subsidiaries, as applicable, own after the Split-Off to be counted as present at any meeting of the stockholders of Cannae Holdings, for the purpose of establishing a quorum, and agrees to vote all of such Cannae Holdings shares (or cause them to be voted) in the same manner as, and in the same proportion to, all shares voted by holders of Cannae Holdings common stock (other than FNF and its subsidiaries), (iii) a registration rights agreement, pursuant to which FNF or its subsidiaries, as applicable, received registration rights with respect to the shares in Cannae held by FNF and (iv) a revolver note with FNF, pursuant to which Cannae Holdings may borrow revolving loans, the proceeds of which may be used for investment purposes and working capital needs, from FNF from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed $100.0 million. The terms of all of these agreements were initially established while we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of FNF, and hence may not be the result of arm's length negotiations.\nWe believe that the terms of these agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements after the Split-Off.\nSales of our common stock by FNF may occur, which could cause our stock price to decline or result in volatility in our stock price.\nIn conjunction with the Split-Off, FNF received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) relating to the tax-free treatment of the Split-Off to FNF and holders of FNFV common stock. One of the representations FNF made to the IRS in soliciting such private letter ruling included an assertion that FNF would dispose of the shares of common stock of the Company it retained no later than 5 years after the closing of the Split-Off which occurred in November 2017. Accordingly, in order to ensure the tax-free treatment of the Split-Off, FNF is expected to dispose of the 5.8 million shares of our common stock it holds over the next several months. If FNF sells its shares of our common stock, or if there is an adverse market perception of the impact of FNF selling its shares, it may decrease the market price of our common stock or result in volatility in our stock price.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nData security and integrity are critically important to the businesses we own and manage, and cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks, breaches of security, unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information, business disruption, or the perception that confidential information is not secure, could result in a material loss of business, regulatory enforcement, substantial legal liability and/or significant harm to their reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImproper access to, misappropriation, destruction or disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data could result in significant harm to our reputation or the reputation of any of the businesses we own. For example, D&B collects, stores and transmits a large amount of confidential company information on over millions of total businesses, including financial information and personal information. D&B operates in an environment of significant risk of cybersecurity incidents resulting from unintentional events or deliberate attacks by third parties or insiders, which may involve exploiting highly obscure security vulnerabilities or sophisticated attack methods.\nWith respect to Alight, one of its significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of its employees\u2019 and clients\u2019 confidential and proprietary information and the confidential information about clients\u2019 employees\u2019 compensation, health and benefits information and other personally identifiable information. With respect to our Restaurant Group companies, they rely heavily on information technology systems across their operations and corporate functions, including for order and delivery from suppliers and distributors, point-of-sale processing in their restaurants, management of their supply chains, payment of obligations, collection of cash, bakery production, data warehousing to support analytics, finance or accounting systems, labor optimization tools, gift cards, online business and various other processes and transactions, including the storage of employee and customer information. With respect to Paysafe, its operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary, personal, financial and other information in its\u2019 computer systems and networks. Paysafe\u2019s information technology security systems, software and networks and those of the customers and third parties with whom Paysafe interacts may be vulnerable to unauthorized access (from within or by third parties), computer viruses or other malicious code, or other cybersecurity threats, which could result in the unauthorized access, loss, theft or disclosure of confidential, proprietary, or personal information relating to merchants, customers and employees.\nThe businesses we own and manage have experienced and expect to continue to experience numerous attempts to access their computer systems, software, networks, data and other technology assets on a daily basis. The security and protection of their data is a top priority for them. Such businesses devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade the wide array of physical, technical and contractual safeguards that they employ to provide security around the collection, storage, use, access and delivery of information they possess. These businesses have implemented various measures to manage their risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but an actual or perceived security breach, a failure to make adequate disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event or a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of its information technology systems could damage a portfolio company\u2019s reputation and cause it to lose clients, adversely impact its operations, sales and operating results and require it to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues.\nAlthough our businesses have not incurred material losses or liabilities to date as a result of any breaches, unauthorized disclosure, loss or corruption of their data or inability of their clients to access their systems, such events could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client, employee or business data, disrupt their operations, subject them to substantial regulatory and legal proceedings and potential liability and fines, result in a material loss of business and/or significantly harm their reputation. If they are unable to efficiently manage the vulnerability of their systems and effectively maintain and upgrade their system safeguards, they may incur unexpected costs and certain of their systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Furthermore, if we are unable to similarly effectively maintain and upgrade our corporate system safeguards, data and confidential information we may have access to from time to time about the businesses we own and manage may also become more vulnerable to unauthorized access.\nDue to concerns about data security and integrity, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted breach notification and other requirements in the event that information subject to such laws is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy and security of such data are possible. For example, in the United States, D&B is subject to laws that provide for at least 50 disparate notification regimes. Complying with such numerous and complex regulations in the event of unauthorized access would be expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could subject D&B to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability. In many jurisdictions, including North America and the European Union, Alight is subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of this information including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (\"HIPAA\") and the HIPAA regulations governing, among other things, the privacy, security and electronic transmission of individually identifiable protected health information, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (\"PIPEDA\") and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"). California also enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\") and the related California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"), that afford California\nresidents expanded privacy protections and a private right of action for security breaches affecting their personal information. These and other similar laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which Alight provides services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Alight\u2019s failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nIf Cannae or its businesses are unable to protect their computer systems, software, networks, data and other technology assets it could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately the value of our businesses. We record many of our ownership interests using the equity method of accounting, through which we record our proportionate share of their net earnings or loss in our consolidated financial statements. Equity-method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If our equity-method investment is not recoverable, we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel could impair our operating abilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will substantially depend on our ability to attract and retain key members of our senior management team and officers. If we lose one or more of these key employees, our operating results and in turn the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Although we may enter into employment agreements with our officers, there can be no assurance that the entire term of any employment agreement will be served or that any employment agreement will be renewed upon expiration.\nThe due diligence process that we undertake in connection with new acquisitions may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with acquisitions of ownership interests.\nBefore making acquisitions, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of business and transaction. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an acquisition, we rely on the resources available to us, including information provided by the target of the transaction and, in some circumstances, third party investigations. The due diligence investigation that we carry out with respect to any opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including fraud) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such opportunity. Moreover, such an investigation will not necessarily result in the acquisition being successful.\nOur management may seek growth through acquisitions in lines of business that will not necessarily be limited to our current areas of focus or geographic areas. This expansion of our business subjects us to associated risks, such as the diversion of management's attention and lack of experience in operating such businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may make acquisitions in lines of business that are not directly tied to or synergistic with our current portfolio companies. Accordingly, we may in the future acquire businesses in industries or geographic areas with which management is less familiar than we are with our current businesses.\nThe acquisition and integration of any business we may acquire involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired business. Furthermore, acquisitions may: (1) involve our entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience; (2) involve difficulties in retaining the customers of the acquired business; (3) involve difficulties and expense associated with regulatory requirements, competition controls or investigations; (4) result in a delay or reduction of sales for both us and the business we acquire; and (5) disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our current business.\nTo complete future acquisitions, we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions. Moreover, we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, such\nas operating improvements or anticipated cost savings, would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition.\nFurther, an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation and amortization of deferred compensation charges, may require the amortization, write-down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs.\nWe may often pursue opportunities that involve businesses, regulatory, legal or other complexities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs an element of our strategy, we may pursue unusually complex opportunities. This could often take the form of substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity. Our tolerance for complexity may present risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute; it may be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions; and such transactions may sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent liabilities. Any of these risks could harm our performance.\nWe and the businesses we own and manage, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, are involved in legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and the businesses we own and manage, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, are involved in pending and threatened litigation matters, some of which include claims for punitive or exemplary damages. We and such companies are also subject to compliance with extensive government laws and regulations related to employment practices and policies. We may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to their satisfaction, and these matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to their business or operations. The defense of these actions may be both time consuming and expensive and their outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty. Determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant legal judgment. It is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows in a particular period or on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe lack of liquidity in certain of our ownership interests may adversely affect our business.\nWe invest, and will continue to invest, in companies whose securities are not publicly traded and whose securities will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of ownership interests with these characteristics may make it difficult for us to sell these positions when desired. In addition, if we are required or otherwise choose to liquidate all or a portion of our assets quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these ownership interests. Our businesses are often subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale or are otherwise illiquid because there is usually no established trading market for such ownership interests. Because certain of our businesses are illiquid, we may be unable to dispose of them timely or we may be unable to do so at a favorable price, and, as a result, we may suffer losses.\nOur charter, bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our charter and bylaws and provisions of the Delaware General Corporate Law (\"DGCL\"), could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, as applicable, even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders. For example, our charter and bylaws: (1) authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by us upon approval of our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive; (2) provide that directors may be removed from office only for cause and that any vacancy on our board of directors may only be filled by a majority of our directors then in office, which may make it difficult for other stockholders to reconstitute our board of directors; (3) provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only upon the request of a majority of our board of directors or by our executive chairman, chief executive officer or president, as applicable; (4) require advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominees; (5) provide that directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by stockholders, which results in each director nominee elected by a plurality winning his or her seat upon receiving one \"for\" vote; and (6) provide that the board of directors is divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with one class being elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, control of Cannae.\nThese restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit stockholder value by impeding a sale of our company.", "PERMNO": 17036, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "CNNE"}
