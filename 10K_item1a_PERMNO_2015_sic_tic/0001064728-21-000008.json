{"cik": "1064728", "company": "PEABODY ENERGY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks. The following discussion highlights some of these risks and others are discussed elsewhere in this report. These and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, operating results or cash flows. The following risk factors are not an exhaustive list of the risks associated with our business. New factors may emerge or changes to these risks could occur that could materially affect our business.\nRisks Associated with Our Operations\nOur profitability depends upon the prices we receive for our coal.\nWe operate in a competitive and highly regulated industry that has experienced strong headwinds. Depressed coal prices have reduced our revenues, and sustained prices at current levels or further declines in coal prices will adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Further declines in coal prices will adversely affect the value of our coal reserves.\nCoal prices are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the demand for electricity and capacity utilization of electricity generating units (whether coal or non-coal);\n\u2022changes in the fuel consumption and dispatch patterns of electric power generators, whether based on economic or non-economic factors;\n\u2022the proximity, capacity and cost of transportation and terminal facilities;\n\u2022competition with and the availability, quality and price of coal and alternative fuels, including natural gas, fuel oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, biomass and solar power;\n\u2022governmental regulations and taxes, including tariffs or other trade restrictions as well as those establishing air emission standards for coal-fueled power plants or mandating or subsidizing increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources;\n\u2022the strength of the global economy;\n\u2022the global supply and production costs of thermal and metallurgical coal;\n\u2022the demand for steel, which may lead to price fluctuations in the monthly and quarterly repricing of our metallurgical coal contracts;\n\u2022weather patterns, severe weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022regulatory, administrative and judicial decisions, including those affecting future mining permits and leases; and\n\u2022technological developments, including those related to alternative energy sources, those intended to convert coal-to-liquids or gas and those aimed at capturing, using and storing carbon dioxide.\nThermal coal accounted for the majority of our coal sales by volume during 2020 and 2019. The vast majority of our sales of thermal coal were to electric power generators. The demand for coal consumed for electric power generation is affected by many of the factors described above, but primarily by (i) the overall demand for electricity; (ii) the availability, quality and price of competing fuels, such as natural gas, nuclear fuel, oil and alternative energy sources; (iii) utilization of all electricity generating units (whether using coal or not), including the relative cost of producing electricity from multiple fuels, including coal; (iv) stringent environmental and other governmental regulations; and (v) the coal inventories of utilities. Gas-fueled generation has displaced and is expected to continue to displace coal-fueled generation (particularly from older, less efficient coal-fueled generation units) as current and potentially increasing regulatory costs and other factors impact the operating decisions of electric power generators. In addition, some electric power generators have made decisions to close coal-fueled generation units given ongoing pressure to shift away from coal generation. Many of the new power plants in the U.S. may be fueled by natural gas because gas-fired plants have been less expensive to construct, permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain based on emissions profiles, and electric power generators may face public and governmental pressure to generate a larger portion of their electricity from natural gas-fueled units and alternative energy sources. Increasingly stringent regulations along with stagnant electricity demand have also reduced the number of new power plants being built. These trends have reduced demand for our coal and the related prices. Any further reduction in the amount of coal consumed by electric power generators could reduce the volume and price of coal that we mine and sell.\nWe produce metallurgical coal that is used in the global steel industry. Metallurgical coal accounted for approximately 17% and 22% of our revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in governmental policies and regulations and changes in the steel industry, including the demand for steel, could reduce the demand for our metallurgical coal. Lower demand for metallurgical coal in international markets could reduce the amount of metallurgical coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nThe balance between coal demand and supply, factoring in demand and supply of closely related and competing segments such as natural gas, both domestically and internationally, could materially reduce coal prices and therefore materially reduce our revenues and profitability. We compete with other fuel sources used for electricity generation, such as natural gas and renewables. Our seaborne products compete with other producers as well as other fuel sources. Declines in the price of natural gas could cause demand for coal to decrease and adversely affect the price of coal. Sustained periods of low natural gas prices or low prices for other fuels may also cause utilities to phase out or close existing coal-fueled power plants or reduce construction of new coal-fueled power plants. In the U.S., no new coal-fueled power plants are being constructed or reopened after closure. These closures could have a material adverse effect on demand and prices for our coal, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nIf a substantial number of our long-term coal supply agreements, including those with our largest customers, terminate, or if the pricing, volumes or other elements of those agreements materially adjust, our revenues and operating profits could suffer if we are unable to find alternate buyers willing to purchase our coal on comparable terms to those in our contracts.\nMost of our sales are made under coal supply agreements, which are important to the stability and profitability of our operations. The execution of a satisfactory coal supply agreement is frequently the basis on which we undertake the development of coal reserves required to be supplied under the contract, particularly in the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived 32% of our revenues from coal supply agreements from our five largest customers. Those five customers were supplied primarily from 28 coal supply agreements (excluding trading and brokerage transactions) expiring at various times from 2021 to 2026.\nMany of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that permit the parties to adjust the contract price upward or downward at specified times. We may adjust these contract prices based on inflation or deflation, price indices and/or changes in the factors affecting the cost of producing coal, such as taxes, fees, royalties and changes in the laws regulating the mining, production, sale or use of coal. In a limited number of contracts, failure of the parties to agree on a price under those provisions may allow either party to terminate the contract. We may experience reductions in coal prices in new long-term coal supply agreements replacing some of our expiring contracts. Coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party. Some coal supply agreements allow customers to vary the volumes of coal that they are required to purchase during a particular period, and where coal supply agreements do not explicitly allow such variation, customers sometimes request that we amend the agreements to allow for such variation. Most of our coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as Btu, sulfur content, ash content, volatile matter, coking properties, grindability and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts. Moreover, some of these agreements allow our customers to terminate their contracts in the event of changes in regulations affecting our industry that restrict the use or type of coal permissible at the customer\u2019s plant or increase the price of coal beyond specified limits.\nOn an ongoing basis, we discuss the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long-term agreements with various customers, but these negotiations may not be successful and these customers may not continue to purchase coal from us under long-term supply agreements.\nThe operating profits we realize from coal sold under supply agreements depend on a variety of factors. In addition, price adjustment and other contract provisions may increase our exposure to short-term coal price volatility. If a substantial portion of our coal supply agreements were modified or terminated, we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to find alternate buyers for our coal at the same level of profitability. Prices for coal vary by mining region and country. As a result, we cannot predict the future strength of the coal industry overall or by mining region and cannot provide assurance that we will be able to replace existing long-term coal supply agreements at the same prices or with similar profit margins when they expire. In addition, our revenue could be adversely affected by a decline in customer purchases (including contractually obligated purchases) due to lack of demand and oversupply, cost of competing fuels and environmental and other governmental regulations.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nRisks inherent to mining could increase the cost of operating our business, and events and conditions that could occur during the course of our mining operations could have a material adverse impact on us.\nOur mining operations are subject to conditions that can impact the safety of our workforce, delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time. These conditions include:\n\u2022elevated gas levels;\n\u2022fires and explosions, including from methane gas or coal dust;\n\u2022accidental mine water discharges;\n\u2022weather, flooding and natural disasters;\n\u2022hazardous events such as roof falls and high wall or tailings dam failures;\n\u2022seismic activities, ground failures, rock bursts or structural cave-ins or slides;\n\u2022key equipment failures;\n\u2022variations in coal seam thickness, coal quality, the amount of rock and soil overlying coal deposits, and geologic conditions impacting mine sequencing;\n\u2022delays in moving our longwall equipment;\n\u2022unexpected maintenance problems; and\n\u2022unforeseen delays in implementation of mining technologies that are new to our operations.\nWe maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some of the risks referenced above, which may lessen the impact associated with these risks. However, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of recovery under our insurance policies in connection with losses associated with these risks.\nOur take-or-pay arrangements could unfavorably affect our profitability.\nWe have substantial take-or-pay arrangements, predominately in Australia, totaling $1.2 billion, with terms ranging up to 22 years, that commit us to pay a minimum amount for rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal even if those commitments go unused. The take-or-pay provisions in these contracts sometimes allow us to apply amounts paid for subsequent deliveries, but these provisions have limitations and we may not be able to apply all such amounts so paid in all cases. Also, we may not be able to utilize the amount of capacity for which we have previously paid. Additionally, we may continue to deliver coal during times when it might otherwise be optimal to suspend operations because these take-or-pay provisions effectively convert a variable cost of selling coal to a fixed operating cost.\nWe may not recover our investments in our mining, exploration and other assets, which may require us to recognize impairment charges related to those assets.\nThe value of our assets have from time to time been adversely affected by numerous uncertain factors, some of which are beyond our control, including unfavorable changes in the economic environments in which we operate; declining coal-fired electricity generation; lower-than-expected coal pricing; technical and geological operating difficulties; an inability to economically extract our coal reserves; and unanticipated increases in operating costs. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $1,487.4 million and $270.2 million of impairment charges related to such factors, as further described in Note 3. \u201cAsset Impairment\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These factors may trigger the recognition of additional impairment charges in the future, which could have a substantial impact on our results of operations.\nBecause of the volatile and cyclical nature of coal markets, it is reasonably possible that our current estimates of projected future cash flows from our mining assets may change in the near term, which may result in the need for adjustments to the carrying value of our assets.\nWe could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 4,600 employees (excluding employees that were employed at operations classified as discontinued), which included approximately 3,500 hourly employees. We are party to labor agreements with various labor unions that represent certain of our employees. Such labor agreements are negotiated periodically, and, therefore, we are subject to the risk that these agreements may not be able to be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms. Approximately 29% of our hourly employees were represented by organized labor unions and generated approximately 18% of our coal production for the year ended December 31, 2020. Relations with our employees and, where applicable, organized labor are important to our success. If some or all of our current non-union operations were to become unionized, we could incur an increased risk of work stoppages, reduced productivity and higher labor costs. Also, if we fail to maintain good relations or successfully negotiate contracts with our employees who are represented by unions, we could potentially experience labor disputes, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or other disruptions in production that could negatively impact our profitability.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nWe could be adversely affected if we fail to appropriately provide financial assurances for our obligations.\nU.S. federal and state laws and Australian laws require us to provide financial assurances related to requirements to reclaim lands used for mining, to pay federal and state workers\u2019 compensation, to provide financial assurances for coal lease obligations and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. The primary methods we use to meet those obligations are to provide a third-party surety bond or provide a letter of credit. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,633.6 million of outstanding surety bonds and $437.6 million of letters of credit with third parties in order to provide required financial assurances for post-mining reclamation, workers\u2019 compensation and other insurance obligations, coal lease-related and other obligations and performance guarantees.\nOur financial assurance obligations may increase or become more costly due to a number of factors, and surety bonds and letters of credit may not be available to us, particularly in light of some banks and insurance companies\u2019 announced unwillingness to support thermal coal producers and other fossil fuel companies. Alternative forms of financial assurance such as self-bonding have been severely restricted or terminated in most of the regions where our mines reside. Our failure to retain, or inability to obtain, surety bonds, bank guarantees or letters of credit, or to provide a suitable alternative, could have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including the following:\n\u2022lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds, bank guarantees or letters of credit; and\n\u2022inability to provide or fund collateral for current and future third-party issuers of surety bonds, bank guarantees or letters of credit.\nAs further described in \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d of Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d the Company reached a surety transaction support agreement with the providers of 99% of its surety bond portfolio to resolve approximately $800 million in additional collateral demands made by the sureties. The sureties have agreed to a standstill through December 31, 2024, during which time, the sureties will not demand any additional collateral, draw on letters of credit posted for the benefit of themselves, or cancel any existing surety bond. Our failure to provide adequate collateral, or abide by other terms in the agreement, could invalidate the agreement and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur failure to maintain adequate bonding would invalidate our mining permits and prevent mining operations from continuing, which could result in our inability to continue as a going concern.\nOur mining operations are extensively regulated, which imposes significant costs on us, and future regulations and developments could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal.\nThe coal mining industry is subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to matters such as:\n\u2022workplace health and safety;\n\u2022limitations on land use;\n\u2022mine permitting and licensing requirements;\n\u2022reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed;\n\u2022the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n\u2022remediation of contaminated soil, sediment and groundwater;\n\u2022air quality standards;\n\u2022water pollution;\n\u2022protection of human health, plant-life and wildlife, including endangered or threatened species and habitats;\n\u2022protection of wetlands;\n\u2022the discharge of materials into the environment; and\n\u2022the effects of mining on surface water and groundwater quality and availability.\nRegulatory agencies have the authority under certain circumstances following significant health and safety incidents to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed. In the event that such agencies ordered the closing of one of our mines, our production and sale of coal would be disrupted and we may be required to incur cash outlays to re-open the mine. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nNew legislation, regulations or orders related to the environment or employee health and safety may be adopted and may materially adversely affect our mining operations, our cost structure or our customers\u2019 ability to use coal. New legislation or administrative regulations (or new interpretations by the relevant government of existing laws, regulations and approvals), including proposals related to the protection of the environment or the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs. Some of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchaser\u2019s plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use. These factors and legislation, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor additional information about the various regulations affecting us, see the sections entitled \u201cRegulatory Matters -U.S.\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Matters - Australia.\u201d\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nOur operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time. A number of laws, including in the U.S., CERCLA and RCRA, impose liability relating to contamination by hazardous substances. Such liability may involve the costs of investigating or remediating contamination and damages to natural resources, as well as claims seeking to recover for property damage or personal injury caused by hazardous substances. Such liability may arise from conditions at formerly, as well as currently, owned or operated properties, and at properties to which hazardous substances have been sent for treatment, disposal or other handling. Liability under RCRA, CERCLA and similar state statutes is without regard to fault, and typically is joint and several, meaning that a person may be held responsible for more than its share, or even all, of the liability involved.\nWe may be unable to obtain, renew or maintain permits necessary for our operations, or we may be unable to obtain, renew or maintain such permits without conditions on the manner in which we run our operations, which would reduce our production, cash flows and profitability.\nNumerous governmental and tribal permits and approvals are required for mining operations. The permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently and are often subject to discretionary interpretations by regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or impractical. As part of this permitting process, when we apply for permits and approvals, we are required to prepare and present to governmental authorities data pertaining to the potential impact or effect that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment. The public, including non-governmental organizations, opposition groups and individuals, have statutory rights to comment upon and submit objections to requested permits and approvals (including modifications and renewals of certain permits and approvals) and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including bringing citizens\u2019 lawsuits to challenge the issuance of permits, the validity of environmental impact statements or the performance of mining activities. In recent years, the permitting required for coal mining has been the subject of increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and extensive litigation by environmental groups.\nAdditionally, our operations may be affected by sites within or near mining areas deemed to have cultural heritage significance to indigenous peoples, and our mining permits may be rescinded or modified, or our mining plans may be voluntarily adjusted, to mitigate against adverse impacts to such sites.\nThe costs, liabilities and requirements associated with these permitting requirements and any related opposition may be extensive and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production which would adversely affect our coal production, cash flows and profitability. Further, required permits may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, or permits issued or renewed may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to efficiently and economically conduct our mining activities, any of which would materially reduce our production, cash flows and profitability.\nConcerns about the impacts of coal combustion on global climate are increasingly leading to consequences that have affected and could continue to affect demand for our products or our securities and our ability to produce, including increased governmental regulation of coal combustion and unfavorable investment decisions by electricity generators.\nGlobal climate issues continue to attract public and scientific attention. Numerous reports, such as the Fourth and the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have also engendered concern about the impacts of human activity, especially fossil fuel combustion, on global climate issues. In turn, increasing government attention is being paid to global climate issues and to emissions of greenhouse gases, including emissions of carbon dioxide from coal combustion by power plants.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nThe enactment of future laws, the passage of regulations, or other executive orders regarding emissions from the use of coal by the U.S., some of its states or other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal mines or coal-fueled power stations could adversely impact the global supply and demand for coal. The potential financial impact on us of such future laws, regulations or other policies will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws, regulations or other policies, the time periods over which those laws, regulations or other policies would be phased in, the state of development and deployment of CCUS technologies as well as acceptance of CCUS technologies to meet regulations and the alternative uses for coal. Similarly, higher-efficiency coal-fired power plants may also be an option for meeting laws or regulations related to emissions from coal use. Several countries, including some major coal users such as China, India and Japan, included using higher-efficiency coal-fueled power plants in their plans under the Paris Agreement. From time to time, we attempt to analyze the potential impact on the Company of as-yet-unadopted, potential laws, regulations and policies. Such analyses require that we make significant assumptions as to the specific provisions of such potential laws, regulations and policies, which sometimes show that if implemented in the manner assumed by the analyses, the potential laws, regulations and policies could result in material adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flows. We do not believe that such analyses reasonably predict the quantitative impact that future laws, regulations or other policies may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nNumerous activist groups are devoting substantial resources to anti-coal activities to minimize or eliminate the use of coal as a source of electricity generation, domestically and internationally, thereby further reducing the demand and pricing for coal, and potentially materially and adversely impacting our future financial results, liquidity and growth prospects.\nSeveral non-governmental organizations have undertaken campaigns to minimize or eliminate the use of coal as a source of electricity generation in the U.S. and across the globe. In an effort to stop or delay coal mining activities, activist groups have brought lawsuits challenging the issuance of individual coal leases, and challenging the federal coal leasing program more broadly. Other lawsuits challenge historical and pending regulatory approvals, permits and processes that are necessary to conduct coal mining operations or to operate coal-fueled power plants, including so-called \u201csue and settle\u201d lawsuits where regulatory authorities in the past have reached private agreements with environmental activists that often involve additional regulatory restrictions or processes being implemented without formal rulemaking.\nThe effect of these and other similar developments has made it more costly and difficult to maintain our business. These cost increases and/or substantial or extended declines in the prices we receive for our coal due to these or other factors could reduce our revenue and profitability, cash flows, liquidity, and value of our coal reserves and could result in material losses.\nOur trading and hedging activities do not cover certain risks and may expose us to earnings volatility and other risks.\nIn addition to coal price volatility, we are currently subject to price volatility on diesel fuel utilized in our mining operations and the Australian dollar. We may in the future enter into hedging arrangements to manage these risks, or other exposures.\nSome of these hedging instruments may require us to post margin based on the value of those instruments and other credit factors. If the fair value of our hedge portfolio moves significantly, or if laws or regulations are passed requiring all hedge arrangements to be exchange-traded or exchange-cleared, we could be required to post additional margin, which could negatively impact our liquidity.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nIf the assumptions underlying our asset retirement obligations for reclamation and mine closures are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated.\nOur asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. These obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, which is driven by the estimated economic life of the mine and the applicable reclamation laws. These cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. Our management and engineers periodically review these estimates. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation, mine closing and post-closure activities. The resulting estimated asset retirement obligation could change significantly if actual amounts change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves that are economically recoverable.\nOur recoverable reserves decline as we produce coal. We have not yet applied for the permits required or developed the mines necessary to use all of our reserves. Moreover, the amount of proven and probable coal reserves described in Part I, Item 2. \u201cProperties\u201d involves the use of certain estimates and those estimates could be inaccurate. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our coal reserves may vary materially from estimates.\nOur future success depends upon our conducting successful exploration and development activities or acquiring properties containing economically recoverable reserves. Our current strategy includes increasing our reserves through acquisitions of government and other leases and producing properties and continuing to use our existing properties and infrastructure. In certain locations, leases for oil, natural gas and coalbed methane reserves are located on, or adjacent to, some of our reserves, potentially creating conflicting interests between us and lessees of those interests. Other lessees\u2019 rights relating to these mineral interests could prevent, delay or increase the cost of developing our coal reserves. These lessees may also seek damages from us based on claims that our coal mining operations impair their interests. Additionally, the U.S. federal government limits the amount of federal land that may be leased by any company to 75,000 acres in any one state and 150,000 acres nationwide. As of December 31, 2020, we leased a total of 44,645 acres from the federal government subject to those limitations.\nOur planned mine development projects and acquisition activities may not result in significant additional reserves, and we may not have success developing additional mines. Most of our mining operations are conducted on properties owned or leased by us. Our right to mine some of our reserves may be materially adversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist. In order to conduct our mining operations on properties where these defects exist, we may incur unanticipated costs. In addition, in order to develop our reserves, we must also own the rights to the related surface property and receive various governmental permits. We cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the permits or appropriate land access necessary for us to operate profitably in the future. We may not be able to negotiate or secure new leases from the government or from private parties, obtain mining contracts for properties containing additional reserves or maintain our leasehold interest in properties on which mining operations have not commenced or have not met minimum quantity or product royalty requirements. From time to time, we have experienced litigation with lessors of our coal properties and with royalty holders. In addition, from time to time, our permit applications and federal and state coal leases have been challenged, causing production delays.\nTo the extent that our existing sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund our planned mine development projects and reserve acquisition activities, we may require access to capital markets, which may not be available to us or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. If we are unable to fund these activities, we may not be able to maintain or increase our existing production rates and we could be forced to change our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nWe face numerous uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal reserves and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability.\nCoal is economically recoverable when the price at which our coal can be sold exceeds the costs and expenses of mining and selling the coal. The costs and expenses of mining and selling the coal are determined on a mine-by-mine basis, and as a result, the price at which our coal is economically recoverable varies based on the mine. Forecasts of our future performance are based on, among other things, estimates of our recoverable coal reserves. We base our reserve information on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff and third parties, which includes various engineers and geologists. The reserve estimates as to both quantity and quality are updated from time to time to reflect production of coal from the reserves and new drilling or other data received. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of coal and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, any one of which may, if incorrect, result in an estimate that varies considerably from actual results. These factors and assumptions include:\n\u2022geologic and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and may differ from our experience in areas we currently mine;\n\u2022demand for coal;\n\u2022current and future market prices for coal, contractual arrangements, operating costs and capital expenditures;\n\u2022severance and excise taxes, royalties and development and reclamation costs;\n\u2022future mining technology improvements;\n\u2022the effects of regulation by governmental agencies;\n\u2022the ability to obtain, maintain and renew all required permits;\n\u2022employee health and safety; and\n\u2022historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas.\nAs a result, actual coal tonnage recovered from identified reserve areas or properties and revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves may vary materially from estimates. Thus, these estimates may not accurately reflect our actual reserves. Any material inaccuracy in our estimates related to our reserves could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs or decreased profitability which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Additionally, our reserve estimates may be adversely affected in the future by the SEC\u2019s recent rule amendments revising property disclosure requirements for publicly-traded mining companies. We will be required to comply with these new rules in 2021.\nJoint ventures, partnerships or non-managed operations may not be successful and may not comply with our operating standards.\nWe participate in several joint venture and partnership arrangements and may enter into others, all of which necessarily involve risk. Whether or not we hold majority interests or maintain operational control in our joint ventures, our partners may, among other things, (1) have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with, or opposed to, ours; (2) seek to block actions that we believe are in our or the joint venture\u2019s best interests; or (3) be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or other agreements, such as contributing capital, each of which may adversely impact our results of operations and our liquidity or impair our ability to recover our investments.\nWhere our joint ventures are jointly controlled or not managed by us, we may provide expertise and advice but have limited control over compliance with our operational standards. We also utilize contractors across our mining platform, and may be similarly limited in our ability to control their operational practices. Failure by non-controlled joint venture partners or contractors to adhere to operational standards that are equivalent to ours could unfavorably affect safety results, operating costs and productivity and adversely impact our results of operations and reputation.\nWe may undertake further repositioning plans that would require additional charges.\nAs a result of our continuing review of our business or changing demand, we may choose to further modify our portfolio of operations and/or reduce our workforce in the future. These actions may result in further restructuring charges, cash expenditures and the consumption of management resources, any of which could cause our operating results to decline and may fail to yield the expected benefits.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the related effects on public health.\nOur operations are susceptible to widespread outbreaks of illness or other public health issues, such as the continuing global COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, including our ability to comply with covenants under our debt agreements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused governments around the world, including in the U.S. and Australia, to implement quarantines, travel bans and shutdowns, which have significantly restricted the movement of people and goods. The continuing spread of COVID-19 has contributed to adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions and disrupted domestic and international credit markets. Within the global coal industry, supply and demand disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have been widespread and have adversely impacted us and our customers, as further described in Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nGovernmental mandates, and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and joint venture and other business partners, have affected and are continuing to affect our business and operations, causing us to modify a number of our normal business practices. Additional governmental mandates could require forced shutdowns of our mines and other facilities for extended or indefinite periods and widespread outbreaks in locations significant to our operations could adversely affect our workforce, resulting in serious health issues and absenteeism. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause supply chains and distribution channels to be interrupted, slowed or rendered inoperable. If our operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for commodities, services and labor, which may be more expensive. Alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers. Further, if our customers\u2019 businesses are similarly affected, they might delay, reduce or cancel purchases from us. Adverse changes in the general domestic and global economic conditions and disrupted domestic and international credit markets, could negatively affect our customers\u2019 ability to pay us as well as our ability to access capital that could negatively affect our liquidity.\nDespite our efforts to manage these realized and potential impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. While the ultimate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business are unknown, we expect continued interference with general commercial activity, which may further negatively affect both demand and prices for our products. We also face disruption to supply chain and distribution channels, potentially increasing costs of production, storage and distribution, and potential adverse effects to our workforce, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur expenditures for postretirement benefit obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nWe pay postretirement health and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation related to such benefits was a liability of $442.9 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $29.7 million was classified as a current liability.\nThese liabilities are actuarially determined. We use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, future cost trends, mortality tables and rates of return on plan assets to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. A decrease in the discount rate used to determine our postretirement benefit and defined benefit pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of these obligations, thereby increasing the cost in subsequent fiscal years. We have made assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes or changes in healthcare benefits provided by the government could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. We develop our actuarial determinations of liabilities using actuarial mortality tables we believe best fit our population\u2019s actual results. In deciding which mortality tables to use, we periodically review our population\u2019s actual mortality experience and evaluate results against our current assumptions as well as consider recent mortality tables published by the Society of Actuaries Retirement Plans Experience Committee in order to select mortality tables for use in our year end valuations. If our mortality tables do not anticipate our population\u2019s mortality experience as accurately as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Additionally, our reported defined benefit pension funding status may be affected, and we may be required to increase employer contributions, due to increases in our defined benefit pension obligation or poor financial performance in asset markets in future years.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nOur defined benefit pension plans are subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). It is implicit in our underlying assumptions that those plans continue to operate in the normal course of business. However, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) may terminate our plans under certain circumstances pursuant to ERISA, including in the event that the PBGC concludes that its risk may increase unreasonably if such plans continue to operate based on its assessment of the plans\u2019 funded status, our financial condition or other factors. Termination of the plans would require us to provide immediate funding or other financial assurance to the PBGC for all or a substantial portion of the underfunded amounts, as determined by the PBGC based on its own assumptions. Those assumptions may differ from our own. Any of those consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial conditions or available liquidity.\nWe are subject to various general operating risks which may be fully or partially outside of our control.\nOur results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely impacted by various general operating risks which may be fully or partially outside of our control. Such risks stem from internal and external sources and include:\n\u2022global economic recessions and/or credit market disruptions;\n\u2022deterioration of the creditworthiness of our customers or counterparties to financial instruments, and their ability to perform under contracts;\n\u2022inability of suppliers and other counterparties, including those related to transportation, contract mining, service provision, and coal trading and brokerage, to fulfil the terms of their contracts with us;\n\u2022decreases in the availability or increases in costs of key supplies, capital equipment or commodities such as diesel fuel, steel, explosives and tires;\n\u2022disruption to, or increased costs within, the transportation chain for coal, including rail, barge, trucking, overland conveyor, ports and ocean-going vessels;\n\u2022failure to attract and retain skilled and qualified personnel, particularly as the prevalence of coal-fired electricity generation declines;\n\u2022new or increased forms of taxation imposed by federal, state, provincial or local governmental authorities, including production taxes, sales-related taxes, royalties, environmental taxes, mining profits taxes and income taxes;\n\u2022uncertainties associated with our global operating platform, including country and political risks, international regulatory requirements, and foreign currency rates; and\n\u2022cyber-attacks or other security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us, our employees, our customers or other third-parties.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Capital Structure\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected by our Indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.5 billion of Indebtedness outstanding, excluding finance leases and debt issuance costs.\nAs more fully described within \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d of Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d in January 2021 we entered into a series of interrelated transactions with our surety bond providers, the revolving lenders under our credit agreement and certain holders of our senior secured notes to extend a significant portion of our near-term debt maturities to December 2024 and to stabilize collateral requirements for our existing surety bond portfolio. While our aggregate amount of Indebtedness did not materially change as a result of these transactions, our incremental cost of borrowing and cash paid for interest expenses will increase prospectively.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nThe degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to pay interest and satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u2022increasing the cost of borrowing;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry or regulatory conditions;\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our Indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, business development or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business development or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022limiting our ability to refinance or otherwise exchange existing debt at commercially acceptable rates;\n\u2022making it more difficult to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financing, particularly during periods in which credit markets are weak;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the coal industry;\n\u2022causing a decline in our credit ratings; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors.\nIn addition, our Indebtedness subjects us to certain restrictive covenants. Failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us and result in amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. The terms of our Indebtedness provide that if we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings or other unfavorable indicators could result in, among other matters, a requirement to post additional collateral on derivative trading instruments that we may enter into, the loss of trading counterparties for corporate hedging and trading and brokerage activities or an increase in the cost of, or a limit on our access to, various forms of credit used in operating our business.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our Indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our Indebtedness may restrict the use of the proceeds from any such sales. We may not be able to complete those sales and the proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nDespite our Indebtedness, we may still be able to incur more debt, which could further increase the risks associated with our Indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future. Although covenants under the indentures governing our senior secured notes and the agreements governing our other Indebtedness, including our credit facility, revolver and finance leases, limit our ability to incur additional Indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions can be material. In addition, the indenture governing the senior secured notes and the agreements governing our other Indebtedness do not limit us from incurring obligations that do not constitute Indebtedness as defined therein.\nThe terms of the indentures governing our senior secured notes and the agreements and instruments governing our other Indebtedness and surety bonding obligations impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe indentures governing our senior secured notes and the agreements governing our other Indebtedness and surety bonding obligations contain certain restrictions and covenants which restrict our ability to incur liens and/or debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person and other restrictions, all of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nThese covenants limit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional Indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of stock or make certain other restricted payments, such as share repurchases;\n\u2022make capital investments;\n\u2022enter into agreements that restrict distributions from certain subsidiaries;\n\u2022sell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022use for general purposes the cash received from certain allowable asset sales or disposals;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create or incur liens;\n\u2022merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022receive dividends or other payments from subsidiaries in certain cases.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we may need to refinance existing debt in the future. A breach of any of these covenants together with the expiration of any cure period, if applicable, could result in a default under our senior secured notes. If any such default occurs, subject to applicable grace periods, the holders of our senior secured notes may elect to declare all outstanding senior secured notes, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. If the obligations under our senior secured notes were to be accelerated, our financial resources may be insufficient to repay the notes and any other Indebtedness becoming due in full.\nIn addition, if we breach the covenants in the indentures governing the senior secured notes and do not cure such breach within the applicable time periods specified therein, we would cause an event of default under the indenture governing the senior secured notes and a cross-default to certain of our other Indebtedness and the lenders or holders thereunder could accelerate their obligations. If our Indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our Indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our Indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions.\nThe number and quantity of viable financing and insurance alternatives available to us may be significantly impacted by unfavorable lending and investment policies by financial institutions and insurance companies associated with concerns about environmental impacts of coal combustion, and negative views around our efforts with respect to environmental and social matters and related governance considerations could harm the perception of our company by a significant number of investors or result in the exclusion of our securities from consideration by those investors.\nCertain banks, other financing sources and insurance companies have taken actions to limit available financing and insurance coverage for the development of new coal-fueled power plants and coal producers and utilities that derive a majority of their revenue from coal, and particularly from thermal coal. This may adversely impact the future global demand for coal. Increasingly, the actions of such financial institutions and insurance companies are informed by non-standardized \u201csustainability\u201d scores, ratings and benchmarking studies provided by various organizations that assess environmental, social and governance matters. Further, there have been efforts in recent years by members of the general financial and investment communities, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other institutional investors, to divest themselves and to promote the divestment of securities issued by companies involved in the fossil fuel extraction market, or that have low ratings or scores in studies and assessments of the type noted above, including coal producers. These entities also have been pressuring lenders to limit financing available to such companies. These efforts may have adverse consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022restricting our ability to access capital and financial markets in the future;\n\u2022reducing the demand and price for our equity securities;\n\u2022increasing the cost of borrowing;\n\u2022causing a decline in our credit ratings;\n\u2022reducing the availability, and/or increasing the cost of, third-party insurance;\n\u2022increasing our retention of risk through self-insurance;\n\u2022making it more difficult to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financing; and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in business development activities such as mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nThe price of our securities may be volatile and could fall below the minimum allowed by New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing requirements.\nThe price of our common stock (Common Stock) may fluctuate due to a variety of market and industry factors that may materially reduce the market price of our Common Stock regardless of our operating performance, including, among others:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public companies in our industry;\n\u2022industry cycles and trends;\n\u2022mergers and strategic alliances in the coal industry;\n\u2022changes in government regulation;\n\u2022potential or actual military conflicts or acts of terrorism;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to publish research about us or to accurately predict the results we actually achieve;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u2022the purchase and sale of shares of our Common Stock by significant shareholders;\n\u2022lack of trading liquidity; and\n\u2022the general volatility of securities markets.\nAs a result of all of these factors, investors in our Common Stock may not be able to resell their stock at or above the price they paid or at all. In the recent past, our closing stock price has fallen below $1.00 per share for a limited number of trading days. If our stock were to trade below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, NYSE could commence suspension and delisting procedures. Further, we could be the subject of securities class action litigation due to any such stock price volatility, which could divert management\u2019s attention and have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nOur Common Stock is subject to dilution and may be subject to further dilution in the future.\nOur Common Stock is subject to dilution from our long-term incentive plan. In addition, in the future, we may issue equity securities in connection with future investments, acquisitions or capital raising transactions. Such issuances or grants could constitute a significant portion of the then-outstanding Common Stock, which may result in significant dilution in ownership of Common Stock.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of a significant stockholder could be in conflict with other stakeholders\u2019 interests.\nCircumstances may arise in which the interests of a significant stockholder may be in conflict with the interests of our other stakeholders. A significant stockholder may exert substantial influence over us to cause us to take action that aligns with their interests, for example, to pursue or prevent acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance or repurchase of additional shares or debt, that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us or another company in which it invests. Such transactions may advance the interests of the significant stockholder and not necessarily those of other stakeholders, which might adversely affect us or other holders of our Common Stock or debt instruments.\nThe payment of dividends on our stock or repurchases of our stock is dependent on a number of factors, and future payments and repurchases cannot be assured.\nAs more fully described within \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d of Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d during the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into transaction support agreements with our surety bond providers which prohibit the payment of dividends on our stock or repurchases of our stock through December 31, 2024, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the agreements. Restrictive covenants in our credit facility and in the indentures governing our senior secured notes also limit our ability to pay cash dividends and repurchase shares. Such restrictions may negatively impact the trading price of the Common Stock. The payment of future cash dividends and future repurchases will depend upon these restrictions, as well as our earnings, economic conditions, liquidity and capital requirements, and other factors, including our leverage and other financial ratios. Accordingly, we cannot make any assurance that future dividends will be paid or future repurchases will be made.\nPeabody Energy Corporation 2020 Form 10-K\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, most significantly Australia. As of December 31, 2020, we had gross deferred income tax assets, including net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, and liabilities of $2,311.6 million and $54.4 million, respectively, as described further in Note 10. \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. At that date, we also had recorded a valuation allowance of $2,287.3 million.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use its NOL carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 (Section 382) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. An ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation\u2019s stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change.\nAlthough we may be able to utilize some or all of those deferred tax assets in the future if we have income of the appropriate character in those jurisdictions (subject to loss carryforward and tax credit expiry, in certain cases), there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Further, we are presently unable to record tax benefits on future losses in the U.S. and Australia until such time as sufficient income is generated by our operations in those jurisdictions to support the realization of the related net deferred tax asset positions. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may adversely be affected in future periods by these limitations.\nAcquisitions and divestitures are a potentially important part of our long-term strategy, subject to our investment criteria, and involve a number of risks, any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits.\nWe may engage in acquisition or divestiture activity based on our set of investment criteria to produce outcomes that increase shareholder value or provide potential strategic benefits. If we fail to accurately estimate the future results and value of an acquired or divested business or assets and the related risk associated with such a transaction, or are unable to successfully integrate the businesses or assets we acquire, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. Moreover, any transactions we pursue could materially impact our liquidity and an acquisition could increase capital resource needs and may require us to incur Indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. We may not be able to satisfy these liquidity and capital resource needs on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, future acquisitions could result in our assuming significant long-term liabilities, including potentially unknown liabilities, relative to the value of the acquisitions.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions that may discourage a takeover attempt.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our by-laws and certificate of incorporation impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nDiversity in interpretation and application of accounting literature in the mining industry may impact our reported financial results.\nThe mining industry has limited industry-specific accounting literature and, as a result, we understand diversity in practice exists in the interpretation and application of accounting literature to mining-specific issues. As diversity in mining industry accounting is addressed, we may need to restate our reported results if the resulting interpretations differ from our current accounting practices.
