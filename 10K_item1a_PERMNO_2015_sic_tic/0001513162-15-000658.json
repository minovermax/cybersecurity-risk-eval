{"cik": "715446", "company": "ITUS Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nOur business involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty, including the following risks and uncertainties:\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Operations\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nOn a cumulative basis we have sustained substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of October 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was approximately $146,149,000. As of October 31, 2015, we had approximately $6,769,000 in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, and working capital of approximately $6,302,000. We incurred losses of approximately $1,379,000 in fiscal year 2015. We expect to incur material research and development expenses and to continue incurring significant legal and general and administrative expenses in connection with our operations. As a result, we anticipate that we will incur losses in the future.\nWe may need additional funding in the future which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if available, may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nBased on currently available information as of December 21, 2015, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and expected cash flows will be sufficient to enable us to continue our business activities for at least 12 months. However, our projections of future cash needs and cash flows may differ from actual results. If current cash on hand, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash that may be generated from our business operations\nare insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell equity securities or obtain loans from various financial institutions where possible. The sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt could result in dilution to our stockholders. Additionally, the sale of equity securities or issuance of debt securities may be subject to certain security holder approvals or may result in the downward adjustment of the exercise or conversion price of our outstanding securities. We can give no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to satisfy our liquidity requirements or sustain future operations, or that other sources of funding, such as sales of equity or debt, would be available or would be approved by our security holders, if needed, on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain such funding if needed or if we cannot sufficiently reduce operating expenses, we would need to curtail or cease some or all of our operations.\nIf we encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that require us to obtain additional working capital, and we cannot obtain additional working capital on favorable terms, or at all, our business will suffer.\nOur consolidated cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand totaled approximately $6,769,000 and $5,861,000 at October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. To date, we have relied primarily upon cash from the public and private sale of equity and debt securities, as well as net proceeds from the December 2014 AUO settlement, to generate the working capital needed to finance our operations.\nAlthough we received an aggregate of $9,000,000 from a Settlement Agreement and Patent Assignment Agreement with AU Optronics Corporation, resolving a lawsuit by the Company, we may need substantial additional capital to continue to operate our business.\nWe may encounter unforeseen difficulties with our business or operations in the future that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. As a result, we may be required to obtain additional working capital in the future through bank credit facilities, public or private debt or equity financings, or otherwise. Other than as disclosed in this Annual Report, we have not identified other sources for additional funding and cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are required to raise additional working capital in the future, such financing may be unavailable to us on favorable terms, if at all, or may be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we fail to obtain additional working capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, such lack of funds may inhibit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital needs, or may force us to reduce operating expenses, which would significantly harm the business and development of operations.\nFailure to effectively manage our potential growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business strategy and potential growth may place a strain on managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Although we may not grow as we expect, if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to develop and expand our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results will be materially harmed.\nRisks Related to Anixa\nAnixa is a pre-revenue biotechnology company and is thus subject to the risks associated with new businesses in that industry.\nSince the Company\u2019s primary focus for the foreseeable future will likely be on Anixa, shareholders should understand that Anixa is an early stage biotechnology company with no history of revenue-generating operations, and its only assets consist of certain intellectual property and know-how of its officers. Therefore, this subsidiary is, and expects for the foreseeable future to be, subject to all the risks and uncertainties inherent in a new business, in particular new businesses engaged in the early detection of certain cancers. Anixa still must establish and implement many important functions necessary to operate a business, including securing its intellectual property rights.\nAccordingly, you should consider the Company\u2019s prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their pre-revenue generating stages, particularly those in the biotechnology field. Shareholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a new subsidiary with no operating history will face. In particular, shareholders should consider that there is a significant risk that Anixa will not be able to:\n\u00b7\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of its tests:\n\u00b7\nimplement or execute\nAnixa\u2019s current business plan, or that Anixa\u2019s business plan is sound; \u00b7\nraise sufficient funds in the capital markets or otherwise to fully effectuate Anixa\u2019s business plan;\n\u00b7\nmaintain its management team, including the members of its scientific advisory board;\n\u00b7\ndetermine that the processes and technologies that Anixa has developed or will develop are commercially viable; and/or\n\u00b7\nattract, enter into or maintain contracts with potential commercial partners such as licensors of technology and suppliers.\nIf Anixa cannot execute any one of the foregoing, its business may fail and the Company will be adversely effected. In addition, we expect to encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. Anixa will need to transition at some point from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. Anixa may not be able to reach such point of transaction or make such a transition, which would have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nWe may have difficulty in raising capital for Anixa and may consume resources faster than expected.\nAnixa currently does not generate any revenue from its diagnostic technology or otherwise and as of October 31, 2015, the Company only had $6,769,000 in cash. Therefore, we have a limited source of cash to meet Anixa\u2019s future capital requirements, which may include the expensive process of obtaining FDA approval for our technology for each type of cancer for\nwhich we desire to launch a diagnostic test. We do not expect Anixa to generate revenues for the foreseeable future, and we may not be able to raise funds for Anixa in the future, which would leave us without resources to continue Anixa\u2019s operations and force us to resort to the Company raising additional capital in the form of equity or debt financings, which may not be available to us. We may have difficulty raising needed capital in the near or longer term as a result of, among other factors, the very early stage of Anixa and Anixa\u2019s lack of revenues as well as the inherent business risks associated with Anixa and present and future market conditions. Also, Anixa may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding sooner than anticipated. Our inability to raise funds for Anixa could lead to decreases in the price of our common stock and the failure of Anixa\u2019s business which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nWhile Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology has shown favorable results from initial testing, we cannot guarantee that these results will be replicated in future testing nor can we guarantee the success of the technology at all.\nWe have initially used Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology to test the blood of a small group of individuals consisting of breast cancer patients and healthy patients. While one hundred percent of the blood samples tested from the breast cancer patients showed the presence of the biomarkers identified by Anixa and none of the healthy patient blood samples contained the biomarkers, there is no guarantee that these results will be replicable when we test a larger group of patients or at all. If we are unable to replicate these results, or if we begin to see a high degree of false positives in future testing, Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology will not have any monetary value and we will be unable to generate any revenue from this product.\nEven if we are able to replicate the results from the initial testing of Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology, our ability to commercialize Anixa\u2019s technology in the future will depend on our ability to provide evidence of clinical utility.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology will depend on numerous factors, including whether health care providers believe that Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests provide sufficient incremental clinical utility; whether the medical community accepts that Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests have sufficient sensitivity (there are no or very few false positives), specificity (detects the cancer the test is supposed to detect) and predictive value to be meaningful in patient care and treatment decisions; whether the technology and the cost of a test is reasonably priced and commercially viable; and whether health insurers, government health programs and other third-party payers will cover and pay for Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests and the amount that they will reimburse for such tests. These factors may present obstacles to commercial acceptance of our diagnostic tests. To the extent these obstacles arise, we will need to devote substantial time and resources to overcome these obstacles, and we might not be successful. Failure to achieve widespread market acceptance of Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are unable to give any assurance that we will be successful in providing sufficient evidence of clinical utility or any assurance that we will have adequate managerial, technical or financial resources to support the studies necessary to provide sufficient evidence of clinical utility of Anixa\u2019s diagnostic testing or differentiate from other diagnostic products in the manner,\ntimeframe or cost parameters we anticipate, if at all. If we are unable to provide evidence of clinical utility and differentiate Anixa\u2019s diagnostic testing, we will not be able to generate the revenues and market growth that we seek. Our failure to generate revenue from the sale of our products would materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDiagnostic test development involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may be unable to commercialize on a timely basis, or at all, Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology.\nWe have begun to devote considerable resources to research and development for Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology, however there can be no assurance that Anixa\u2019s technology will be capable of reliably predicting the occurrence or recurrence of any cancers with the sensitivity and specificity necessary to be clinically and commercially useful, or, even if such technology is clinically and commercially useful, that it will result in commercially successful products. In addition, before we can fully develop Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology and commercialize any new products, we will need to:\n\u00b7\nconduct substantial research and development;\n\u00b7\nconduct validation studies;\n\u00b7\nexpend significant funds;\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements and maintain relationships with third party vendors to provide third party blood samples;\n\u00b7\nobtain regulatory approval (either CLIA, FDA or both); and\n\u00b7\nestablish or contract with the owner of a CLIA certified laboratory to process test samples.\nAccordingly, Anixa\u2019s product development process involves a high degree of risk and may take several years, especially if the Company seeks FDA approval for each of the diagnostic tests. If Anixa\u2019s biomarker technology should fail at the research or development stage, not produce sufficient clinical validation data to support the effectiveness of the product or not gain regulatory approval or if we should run out of cash to devote towards the commercialization of the technology or fail to establish agreements with necessary third party vendors, Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology will not make it to commercialization and we will not generate any revenue from the product.\nIf we fail to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology, and our ability to generate revenue and the viability of Anixa and our Company will be materially impaired.\nCommercialization of Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology will require that we obtain either CLIA certification, FDA approval or both. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests, we will be unable to commercialize and generate revenue from the technology which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we obtain FDA approval for Anixa\u2019s biomarker testing, we will be dependent on laboratory contractors for testing of patient samples that are essential to the development and validation of Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests.\nTo pursue the development and validation of Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests, Anixa will require access to test results obtained from patient blood samples. Anixa has currently contracted with Wistar to provide these services. Unless and until Anixa\u2019s biomarker tests receive FDA approval, Anixa may elect to seek CLIA certification for one or more of its biomarker tests. Failure to receive FDA approval or CLIA certification would have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and validate Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests.\nWe will be dependent on third parties for the patient samples that are essential to the development and validation of Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests.\nTo pursue our development and validation of Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests, we are likely to need access, over time, to patient blood samples and such patients will need to consent to the use of their blood. We do not have direct access to a supply of patient samples. As a result, we have made arrangements with Wistar that has given us access to patient samples for the development and validation of Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests. We may lose access to patient samples provided by third parties, or have that access limited, because the third parties decrease the number of patient samples they provide, due to changes in privacy laws governing the use and disclosure of medical information or due to changes in the laws restricting Anixa\u2019s ability to obtain patient samples and associated information. If Anixa fails to secure and maintain an adequate supply of patient samples, Anixa\u2019s ability to pursue its development efforts may be slowed or halted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAnixa\u2019s business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, the law or regulations of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or the FDA or other federal, state or local agencies.\nThe clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The CLIA are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories (regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiring that they be certified under federal law. CLIA does not pre-empt state law, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. The FDA regulates diagnostic products and periodically inspects and reviews their manufacturing processes and product performance. We may choose to seek FDA approval for Anixa\u2019s biomarker tests. We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations\ninclude significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly, including FDA regulation of laboratory developed tests.\nHealth insurers and other third-party payers may decide not to reimburse Anixa\u2019s diagnostic testing or may provide inadequate reimbursement, which could jeopardize our commercial prospects and require customers to pay for the tests out of pocket.\nIn the United States, the regulatory process that allows diagnostic tests to be marketed is independent of any coverage determinations made by third-party payers. For new diagnostic tests, private and government payers decide whether to cover the test, the reimbursement amount for a covered test and the specific conditions for reimbursement. Physicians may order diagnostic tests that are not reimbursed by third-party payers, but coverage determinations and reimbursement levels and conditions are critical to the commercial success of a diagnostic product. Each third-party payer makes its own decision about which tests it will cover and how much it will pay, although many payers will follow the lead of Medicare. As a result, the coverage determination process will be a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific, clinical and economic support for the use of Anixa\u2019s diagnostic testing to each payer separately, with no assurance that approval will be obtained. If third-party payers decide not to cover Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests or if they offer inadequate payment amounts, our ability to generate revenue from Anixa\u2019s diagnostic tests could be limited since patients who want to take the diagnostic tests would have to pay for it out of pocket. Even if one or more third-party payers decide to reimburse for Anixa\u2019s tests, a third-party payer may stop or lower payment at any time, which could reduce revenue. We cannot predict whether third-party payers will cover Anixa\u2019s tests or offer adequate reimbursement. We also cannot predict the timing of such decisions. In addition, physicians or patients may decide not to order Anixa\u2019s tests if third-party payments are inadequate, especially if ordering the test could result in financial liability for the patient.\nWhether or not health insurers and other third-party payers decide to reimburse Anixa\u2019s diagnostic testing, the technology may cost patients more than we anticipate.\nWe believe that Anixa\u2019s diagnostic technology will significantly reduce the cost to patients of screening for certain types of cancer. If, however, the cost to utilize Anixa\u2019s technology is more expensive than we anticipate, many patients and third-party payers may elect not to utilize the technology which would significantly impact our ability to generate revenue on the technology.\nWe operate in a competitive market and expect to face intense competition, often from companies with greater resources and experience than us.\nThe clinical diagnostics industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. We are aware of many different types of diagnostic tests available to detect cancer that are currently in use or being developed and many more types of diagnostic tests may be developed in the future. If we are able to successfully commercialize our diagnostic technology, all of these tests will compete with our product. If our diagnostic technology is more expensive than and/or does not have sufficient specificity, sensitivity or predictive value to compete with tests that are currently on the market, or if any other diagnostic tests that are under development, once\nsuccessfully developed and commercialized, have greater specificity, sensitivity or predictive value and/or are cheaper than our technology, we may be unable to compete successfully with such products which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, as the industry continues to expand and evolve, an increasing number of competitors and potential competitors may enter the market. Many of these competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than we do. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have more experience than we do in the development of diagnostic products, including validation procedures and regulatory matters. In addition, our diagnostic tests will compete with product offerings from large and well established companies that have greater marketing and sales experience and capabilities than we do. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to sustain and grow our revenue.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection, Anixa\u2019s competitive position will be harmed.\nAnixa\u2019s ability to compete and to achieve sustained profitability will be impacted by its ability to protect its proprietary discoveries and technologies, including its technology for detecting biomarkers. We expect to rely on a combination of patent protection, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and regulatory approvals to protect Anixa\u2019s technologies. Anixa\u2019s intellectual property strategy is intended to help develop and maintain its competitive position. However, we cannot assure you that Anixa will be able to obtain patent protection for its methods of detecting biomarkers and processing its diagnostic tests, nor can we be certain that the steps we will have taken will prevent the misappropriation and unauthorized use of our technologies. If we are not able to obtain and maintain patent protection over Anixa\u2019s technologies, our competitive position will be harmed.\nWe are dependent upon a few key personnel and the loss of their services could adversely affect us.\nOur future success of developing our cancer diagnostics subsidiary will depend on the efforts of ITUS\u2019s Vice Chairman, and the Executive Chairman of Anixa, Dr. Amit Kumar. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on Dr. Kumar. The loss of the services of Dr. Kumar could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Patent Licensing Activities\nWe may not be able to license our patent portfolios which may have an adverse impact on our future operations.\nWe may generate revenues and related cash flows from the licensing and enforcement of patents that we currently own, from technologies that we develop and from the rights to license and enforce additional patents we have obtained, and may obtain in the future, from third parties. However, we can give no assurances that we will be able to identify opportunities to exploit such patents or that such opportunities, even if identified, will generate sufficient revenues to sustain future operations.\nWe, in certain circumstances, rely on representations, warranties and opinions made by third parties that, if determined to be false or inaccurate, may expose us to certain material liabilities.\nFrom time to time, we may rely upon the opinions of purported experts. In certain instances, we may not have the opportunity to independently investigate and verify the facts upon which such opinions are made. By relying on these opinions, we may be exposed to liabilities in connection with the licensing and enforcement of certain patents and patent rights which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn connection with patent licensing activities conducted by certain of our subsidiaries, a court that has ruled unfavorably against us may also impose sanctions or award attorney\u2019s fees, exposing us and our operating subsidiaries to certain material liabilities.\nIn connection with any of our patent licensing activities, it is possible that a court that has ruled against us may also impose sanctions or award attorney\u2019s fees to defendants, exposing us or our operating subsidiaries to material liabilities, which could materially harm our operating results and our financial condition.\nOur patented technologies have an uncertain market value.\nMany of our patents and technologies are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies is untested and is subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our licensees will adopt our patents and technologies in their products and services.\nWe may choose to further develop our patented technologies or invest in new patented technologies which are in need of development.\nEarly stage technologies involve a high degree of risk, and the development of early stage technologies can be capital intensive. Should we decide to further develop our patented technologies, or invest in new patented technologies, we may not have the capital necessary to continually fund the development of the technologies, and the likelihood of achieving commercial success with any early stage technology is highly speculative.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for operations and acquisitions of patents and/or companies. We have and in the future may issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute stockholders' ownership interests in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.\nAny actual or anticipated sales of shares by our stockholders may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our stockholders, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nDelaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.\nProvisions of Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) and our certificate of incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and by-laws (\u201cBy-Laws\u201d) could make the acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and the removal of incumbent officers and directors, more difficult. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nSection 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a merger with a 15%-or-greater stockholder, such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer, until three years after that party became a 15%-or-greater stockholder;\n\u00b7\nThe authorization in our Certificate of Incorporation of undesignated preferred stock, which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover; and\n\u00b7\nProvisions in our By-Laws regarding stockholders' rights to call a special meeting of stockholders limit such rights to stockholders holding together at least a majority of shares of the Company entitled to vote at the meeting, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our Board of Directors or to vote to repeal any of the anti-takeover provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.\nTogether, these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that could otherwise involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in quarterly operating results, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur reported revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, specifically as we continue to devote more of our resources towards Anixa and our diagnostic technology. It is possible that in future periods, we will have no revenue or, in any event, revenues could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The following are among the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period:\n\u00b7\nclinical trial results relating to our diagnostic technology;\n\u00b7\nprogress with regulatory authorities towards the certification/approval of our diagnostic technology;\n\u00b7\ncommercialization of our diagnostic technology; and\n\u00b7\ncosts related to acquisitions, alliances and licenses;\nTechnology company stock prices are especially volatile, and this volatility may depress the price of our common stock.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and the market prices of technology companies have been highly volatile. We believe that various factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, among others, the following:\n\u00b7\nannouncements of developments in the cancer diagnostic testing industry;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in relationships with third party vendors and laboratories;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of developments in our remaining patent enforcement actions;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our patents and other intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nour or our competitors' technological innovations;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nour failure to meet or exceed securities analysts' expectations of our financial results;\n\u00b7\na change in financial estimates or securities analysts' recommendations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in management's or securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance;\n\u00b7\ndebt crises affecting several countries in the European Union and concerns about sovereign debt of the United States;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents; and\n\u00b7\nthe timing of or our failure to complete significant transactions.\nIn addition, we believe that fluctuations in our stock price during applicable periods can also be impacted by changes in governmental regulations in the diagnostic testing industry and/or court rulings and/or other developments in our remaining patent licensing and enforcement actions. For example, if government regulators no longer allow for the use of\ndiagnostic technology that has not been granted FDA approval (e.g. denying products that have only received CLIA certification), the time and cost to bring our technology to market will increase which will likely have an adverse impact on our stock price.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation. If our common stock was the object of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our business and financial results.\nOur common stock is currently listed on NASDAQ Capital Market, however if our common stock is delisted for any reason, it will become subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules which may make our shares more difficult to sell.\nIf our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock will then fit the definition of a penny stock and therefore would be subject to the rules adopted by the SEC regulating broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. The SEC rules may have the effect of reducing trading activity in our common stock making it more difficult for investors to sell their shares. The SEC\u2019s rules require a broker or dealer proposing to effect a transaction in a penny stock to deliver the customer a risk disclosure document that provides certain information prescribed by the SEC, including, but not limited to, the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker or dealer must also disclose the aggregate amount of any compensation received or receivable by him in connection with such transaction prior to consummating the transaction. In addition, the SEC\u2019s rules also require a broker or dealer to make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction before completion of the transaction. The existence of the SEC\u2019s rules may result in a lower trading volume of our common stock and lower trading prices.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock which may adversely impact the market price of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable to you because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nThe securities issued in our private placements and registered direct offering may dilute your percentage ownership interest and may also result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nIn connection with our private placements in February 2011, January 2013 and November 2013 and our registered direct offering in July 2014, we have outstanding shares of preferred stock (following the conversion of the Debenture issued in November 2013) and warrants which are convertible into or exercisable for an aggregate of 1,768,889 shares of our common stock, at prices ranging from $4.465 to $10.00 per share. In addition, as we have registered these shares for resale by the holders, it is possible that a significant number of shares could be sold at the same time. Because the market for our common stock is thinly traded, the\nsales and/or the perception that those sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the mere existence of a significant number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock or the exercise of warrants may be perceived by the market as having a potential dilutive effect, which could lead to a decrease in the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 27167, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ANIX"}
