{"cik": "1004724", "company": "REGIONAL HEALTH PROPERTIES, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, operations and financial condition. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. This section does not describe all risks applicable to our business, and we intend it only as a summary of certain material factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of the common stock and the Series A Preferred Stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur portfolio stabilization measures expose the Company to the various risks facing our tenants.\nWhile the Company is a self-managed real estate investment company that invests primarily in real estate purposed for long-term care and senior living, when business conditions require, the Company may undertake portfolio\nstabilization measures. On January 1, 2021, following the Wellington Transition, the Company commenced operating the Tara Facility, which facility comprises approximately 5% of our total amount of the Company\u2019s licensed patient beds. This portfolio stabilization measure exposes the Company directly to all the risks our tenants face as discussed in this \u201cRisk Factor\u201d section.\nOur leases with tenants comprise our rental revenue and any failure, inability or unwillingness by these tenants to satisfy their obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business depends upon our tenants meeting their obligations to us, including their obligations to pay rent, maintain certain insurance coverage, pay real estate and other taxes and maintain and repair the leased properties. We give no assurance that these tenants will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by these tenants to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, any failure by these tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we give no assurance that our tenants will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations.\nThe duration and extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures have adversely affected our operations and those of our operators. The operations and occupancy levels at the seniors housing and health care facilities of our tenants have been adversely affected by COVID-19 and could be further adversely affected by COVID-19, or another pandemic, especially if there is a surge in infections at any of our tenant\u2019s properties. The impact of COVID-19 has resulted in, and another pandemic could result in: early resident move-outs, our operators delaying new resident admission due to quarantines, potential occupants postponing moves to our operators\u2019 facilities, and/or hospitals cancelling or significantly reducing elective surgeries thereby reducing the number of people in need of skilled nursing care. Operating costs of our lessees and borrowers also have risen due to the impact of COVID-19, including cost increases in staffing and pay, purchases of personal protective equipment (\u201cPPE\u201d), and implementation of additional safety protocols. In response to requests by operators adversely impacted by COVID-19, we provided rent deferrals totaling $0.1 million between October and December 2020. Additionally, health orders, rent moratoriums, and other initiatives by federal, state, and local authorities could affect our operators and our ability to collect rent and/or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent. The extent to which COVID-19 or another pandemic could impact our operations and those of our operators will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration, spread and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures. Further, if COVID-19 results in an extended adverse trend away from senior housing and health care facilities and towards at-home and alternative care services, the occupancy rates of our operators and the value of our real estate investments could be negatively impacted.\nWe depend on affiliates of C.R Management and Aspire for a significant portion of our revenues and any inability or unwillingness by such entities to satisfy their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs of the date of filing this Annual Report, our 21 properties (excluding the three facilities that are managed by us) are operated by a total of 21 separate tenants, with each of our tenants being affiliated with one of seven local or regionally-focused operators. We refer to our tenants who are affiliated with the same operator as a group of affiliated tenants. Each of our operators operate (through a group of affiliated tenants) between one and six of our facilities, with our material operators, C.R Management and Aspire, each operating (through a group of affiliated tenants) six and five facilities, respectively. We, therefore depend, on tenants who are affiliated with C.R Management and Aspire for a significant portion of our revenues. We give no assurance that the tenants affiliated with C.R Management and Aspire will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their obligations under the applicable leases and subleases, and any inability or unwillingness by such tenants to do so could have a material adverse effect on us.\nA prolonged economic slowdown could adversely impact the results of operations of our tenants, which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nWe believe the risks associated with our investments will be more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession (such as the most recent recession) due to the adverse impact caused by various factors, including the current outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, inflation, deflation, increased unemployment, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, a distressed real estate market, market volatility and weakened business and consumer confidence. This difficult operating environment caused by an economic slowdown or recession could have an adverse impact on the ability of our tenants to maintain occupancy rates, which could harm their financial condition. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses by our tenants could adversely affect our income from investments in our portfolio.\nIncreased competition, as well as increased operating costs, could result in lower revenues for some of our tenants and may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nThe long-term care industry is highly competitive, and we expect that it will become more competitive in the future. Our tenants are competing with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement communities and convalescent centers. Our tenants compete on a number of different levels, including the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price, the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding areas. We cannot be certain that all of our tenants will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet their full obligations to us. Our tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract patients or residents or expand their businesses which would in turn affect their ability to make their lease payments to us.\nIn addition, the market for qualified nurses, healthcare professionals and other key personnel is highly competitive, and our tenants may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Increases in labor costs due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel incurred by our tenants could affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. This situation could be particularly acute in certain states and cities that have enacted legislation establishing minimum staffing requirements.\nDisasters and other adverse events may seriously harm our business.\nOur facilities and our business may suffer harm as a result of natural or man-made disasters such as storms, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, terrorist attacks and other conditions. The impact, or impending threat, of such events may require that our tenants evacuate one or more facilities, which could be costly and would involve risks, including potentially fatal risks, for their patients. The impact of disasters and similar events is inherently uncertain. Such events could harm our tenants\u2019 patients and employees, severely damage or destroy one or more of our facilities, harm our tenants\u2019 business, reputation and financial performance, or otherwise cause our tenants\u2019 businesses to suffer in ways that we are unable to predict.\nA severe cold and flu season, epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19, or any other widespread illnesses, could adversely affect the occupancy of our tenants\u2019 facilities.\nOur revenue and our tenants\u2019 revenues are dependent upon occupancy. It is impossible to predict the severity of the annual cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics, pandemics or any other widespread illnesses. The occupancy of our skilled nursing and assisted living facilities could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic, pandemic, or any other widespread illness. Such a decrease could affect the operating income of our tenants and the ability of our tenants to make payments to us. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus originating in China to be a public health emergency of international concern posing a high risk to countries with vulnerable health systems. Since this declaration, the virus continues to spread globally, including within our domestic borders within where the Company operates, contributing to significant uncertainty in the domestic and global economy. Our tenants and hence the Company may incur expenses or reduced occupancy relating to such events outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nTenant financial or legal difficulties could limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new tenants.\nIf a lessee experiences financial or legal difficulties, it could fail to pay us rent when due, assert counterclaims, or seek bankruptcy protection. In the case of a master lease, this risk is magnified, as a default could reduce or eliminate rental revenue from several properties. Over the past three years, four of our operators have experienced or continue to experience financial or legal difficulties resulting in non-payment of rent or bankruptcy. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-\u201cLeased and Subleased Facilities to Third-Party Operators\u201d for further discussion. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and depending its scope and duration could continue to cause, financial and legal difficulties for certain of our lessees. If an operator is unable to comply with the terms of its leases, we could be asked to defer rent or forced to modify the leases in ways that are unfavorable to us. Alternatively, the failure of an operator to perform its obligations under a lease or other agreements with us could force us to declare a default and terminate the lease. There can be no assurance that we would be able to find a suitable replacement operator, re-lease the property on substantially equivalent or better terms than the prior lease, if at all. If a lessee seeks bankruptcy protection, it could delay our efforts to collect past due amounts owed to us under the applicable lease and ultimately preclude collection of all or a portion of those amounts.\nWe have been and may in the future be named as a defendant in litigation involving the services provided by our tenants. Although we generally have no involvement in the services provided by our tenants, and our standard lease agreements generally require our tenants to indemnify us and carry insurance to protect us in certain cases, a significant judgment against us in such litigation could exceed the aggregate of our and our respective tenants\u2019 insurance coverage, which would require us to make payments to cover any such judgment.\nOur tenants who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. See \u201cGovernmental Regulation-Healthcare Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d in this Annual Report. These lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. If any of these lawsuits are brought against our tenants, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our tenants\u2019 liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and on their ability to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which, could in turn, have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf we must replace any of our tenants, we might be unable to rent the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. If any of our triple-net leases are not renewed, we would attempt to rent those properties to another tenant. In addition, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant. We also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new tenants on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate and bed taxes, and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. In addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings.\nMoreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants\u2019 lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. Our ability to exercise remedies under the applicable leases or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. Any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by policies maintained by our tenants may not adequately insure against losses.\nWe maintain or require in our leases that our tenants maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. Although we regularly review the amount and scope of insurance maintained by our tenants and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we give no assurance you that our tenants will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. We also give no assurance that our tenants will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our leases, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guarantee as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite the policies maintained by our tenants.\nFor various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. Companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. However, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. As a result, the tenants of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. If tenants of our properties decide to implement a captive or self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses incurred could have a material adverse effect on us.\nShould an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. Following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We give no assurance that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future.\nFailure by our tenants to comply with various local, state, and federal government regulations may adversely impact their ability to make lease payments to us.\nThe failure of our tenants to comply with federal, state, or local regulations could result in penalties which could include loss or restriction of license, loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or decertification from federal, state and local health care programs, or closure of the facility. These regulations have increased in response to COVID-19. The loss or imposition of restrictions on any required license, registration, certificate of need, provider agreement or certification would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operator. Additionally, failure by any of our operators to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in adverse publicity and reputational harm, and therefore could harm our business.\nOur tenants depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payors, and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced.\nThe ability of our tenants to generate revenue and profit determines the underlying value of that property to us. Revenues of our tenants are generally derived from payments for patient care. Sources of such payments include the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, health care service plans, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider arrangements, self-insured employers, as well as the patients themselves.\nThe health care industry continues to face increased government and private payor pressure on health care providers to control costs. Federal legislative and regulatory policies have been adopted and may continue to be proposed that would reduce Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to nursing facilities. Moreover, state budget pressures continue to result in adoption of Medicaid provider payment reductions in some states. Increasingly, state Medicaid programs are providing coverage through managed care programs under contracts with private health plans, which is intended to decrease state Medicaid costs. In light of continuing federal and state Medicaid program reforms, budget cuts, and regulatory initiatives, no assurance can be given that the implementation of such regulations and reforms will not have an adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our tenants and/or borrowers which, in turn, could affect their ability to meet their contractual obligations to us.\nFurthermore, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted and signed into law that repealed the individual mandate in the Health Reform Law. Because the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 decision finding the Healthcare Reform Law constitutional was grounded, at least in part, on the inclusion of the individual mandate in the law, a federal trial court found the entire law unconstitutional upon the mandate\u2019s repeal. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision in 2019, and the matter was sent back to the trial court for additional analysis. While there have been efforts to repeal the law and enact alternative reforms, the Biden Administration has indicated it will support and expand upon the Health Reform Law. There is no assurance that the implementation of Health Reform Law or any subsequent modifications or related legal challenges will not adversely impact the operations cash flows or financial conditions of our lessees, which subsequently coup materially and adversely impact our revenue and operations.\nChanges in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including insurance companies and the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on our tenants.\nOur tenants rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the Medicare (both traditional Medicare and \u201cmanaged\u201d Medicare/Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. Federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider Medicaid rate freezes or cuts. Private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. We give no assurance that our tenants who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. Significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition, and operations of some of our tenants. These limits may be imposed by statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal\nintermediaries or carriers, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities), interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property, or private payor efforts. Additionally, these limits could adversely affect our tenants' ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new healthcare properties could reduce our profitability.\nOur business strategy contemplates future acquisitions that may not prove to be successful. For example, we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to our acquired healthcare properties, including contingent liabilities, or our newly acquired healthcare properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. Such costs may negatively affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to resolve our professional and general liability actions on terms acceptable to us, then it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Company is a defendant in various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims that the services the Company provided during the time it operated skilled nursing facilities resulted in injury or death to former patients. Although the Company settles cases from time to time if settlement is advantageous to the Company, the Company vigorously defends any matter in which it believes the claims lack merit and the Company has a reasonable chance to prevail at trial or in arbitration. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and there is risk in the Company\u2019s strategy of aggressively defending these cases. There is no assurance that the outcomes of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nAs of the date of filing this Annual Report, the Company is a defendant in 13 professional and general liability actions, one such action was commenced on behalf of a former patient of the Company and the remaining actions were commenced by former patients of the Company\u2019s current or prior tenants. These actions generally seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for former patients who were allegedly injured or died while patients of our facilities due to professional negligence or understaffing. One such action, on behalf of the Company\u2019s former patient, is covered by insurance, except that any award of punitive damages would be excluded from such coverage. 12 of such actions relate to events which occurred after the Company transitioned the operations of the facilities in question to a third-party operator and which are subject to such operators\u2019 indemnification obligations in favor of the Company.\nThe Company has self-insured against professional and general liability actions since it discontinued its healthcare operations in connection with the Transition. The Company established a self-insurance reserve for these professional and general liability claims, included within \u201cAccrued expenses\u201d in the Company\u2019s audited consolidated balance sheets of $0.2 million and $0.5 million at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. Additionally as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million was reserved for settlement amounts in \u201cAccounts payable\u201d in the Company\u2019s audited consolidated balance sheets. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d in this Annual Report. Also see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Self Insurance Reserve\u201d in Part II, Item 7., \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report.\nThe Company believes that most of the professional and general liability actions are defensible and intends to defend them through final judgment, unless settlement is more advantageous to the Company. Accordingly, the self-insurance reserve primarily reflects the Company\u2019s estimate of settlement amounts for the pending actions, as appropriate, and legal costs of settling or litigating the pending actions, as applicable.\nBecause the self-insurance reserve is based on estimates, the amount of the self-insurance reserve may not be sufficient to cover the settlement amounts actually incurred in settling the pending actions, or the legal costs actually incurred in settling or litigating the pending actions. The amount of the self-insurance reserve may increase, perhaps by a material amount, in any given period, particularly if the Company determines that it has probable exposure in one or more actions. If we are unable to resolve the pending actions on terms acceptable to us, then it could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have a history of operating losses and may incur losses in the future.\nOur real estate investments are relatively illiquid.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. In addition, all of our owned healthcare properties serve as collateral for our secured debt obligations and may not be readily sold. Additional factors that are specific to our industry also tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. For example, all of our healthcare properties are \u201cspecial purpose\u201d properties that cannot be readily converted into general residential, retail or office use. In addition, transfers of operations of skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and other healthcare facilities are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate. Thus, if the operation of any of our healthcare properties becomes unprofitable due to competition, age of improvements or other factors such that a tenant becomes unable to meet its obligations to us, then the liquidation value of the property may be substantially less, particularly relative to the amount owed on any related mortgage loan, than would be the case if the property were readily adaptable to other uses. Furthermore, the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of a tenant who has defaulted on its lease could be delayed by the approval process of any federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the tenant with a new tenant licensed to manage the facility. In addition, certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment. Should such events occur, our revenues would be adversely affected.\nAs an owner with respect to real property, we may be exposed to possible environmental liabilities.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we, as a current or previous owner of real property, may be liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation, removal, remediation of, or related releases, of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances, including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. Such laws often impose liability regardless of the owner\u2019s knowledge of, or responsibility for, the presence or disposal of such substances. As a result, liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of an operator of the property.\nThe cost of any required investigation, remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner\u2019s liability therefor could exceed the value of the property and the assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect an operator\u2019s ability to attract additional patients or residents and our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could negatively impact our revenues.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive.\nOur business is highly competitive, and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future. We compete for healthcare facility investments with other healthcare investors, many of which have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our investment criteria. If we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient number of healthcare facilities at favorable prices, or if we are unable to finance such acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In addition, if our cost of capital should increase relative to the cost of capital of our competitors, the realized return on our investments may decline if competitive pressures limit or prevent us from charging higher lease rates.\nThe geographic concentration of our facilities could leave us vulnerable to an economic downturn or adverse regulatory changes in those areas.\nOur properties are located in six states, with concentrations in Georgia and Ohio. As a result of this concentration, the conditions of state and local economies and real estate markets, changes in governmental rules, regulations and\nreimbursement rates or criteria, changes in demographics, state and local funding, acts of nature and other factors that may result in a decrease in demand and reimbursement for skilled nursing services in these states could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our tenants\u2019 revenue, costs and results of operations, which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nIf we lose our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are dependent on our management team, and our future success depends largely upon the management experience, skill, and contacts of our management and the loss of any of our key management team could harm our business. If we lose the services of any or all of our management team, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur directors and officers substantially control all major decisions.\nOur directors and officers beneficially own a significant number of shares of our outstanding common stock. Therefore, our directors and officers will be able to influence major corporate actions required to be voted on by shareholders, such as the election of directors, the amendment of our charter documents and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers, reorganizations, sales of substantially all of our assets and liquidation. Furthermore, our directors will be able to make decisions affecting our capital structure, including decisions to issue additional capital stock, implement stock repurchase programs and incur indebtedness. This control may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $54.4 million in indebtedness, including current maturities of debt. We may also obtain additional short-term and long-term debt to meet future capital needs, subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, which would increase our total debt. Our substantial amount of debt could have negative consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to interest and principal payments on outstanding debt, thereby limiting the availability of cash flow for dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to maintain certain debt coverage and other financial ratios at specified levels, thereby reducing our financial flexibility;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022\nexpose us to increases in interest rates for our variable rate debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms, or at all, for working capital, debt service requirements, expansion of our business or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity on the same or more favorable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity.\nIn addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future will depend in part on the satisfaction of the covenants in our debt agreements. If we are unable to satisfy the financial covenants contained in those agreements, or are unable to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, the lenders and other parties to those arrangements could accelerate the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe may not have sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs.\nFor the year ended and as of December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $0.7 million. At December 31, 2020, we had $4.2 million in cash, as well as restricted cash of approximately $3.3 million, and $54.4 million in indebtedness net of $1.4 million deferred financing and unamortized discounts, of which the Company anticipates net principal repayments of approximately $2.3 million during the next twelve-month period. Additionally as of December 31, 2020, as a result of the suspension of the dividend payment on the Series A Preferred Stock commencing with the fourth quarter 2017 dividend period, the Company has $27.9 million of accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends.\nManagement anticipates access to, and receipt of, several sources of liquidity, including cash from operations and cash on hand. We have routine ongoing discussions with existing and potential new lenders to refinance current debt on a longer-term basis and, in recent periods, have refinanced short-term acquisition-related debt with traditional long-term mortgage notes, some of which have been executed under government guaranteed lending programs.\nIn order to satisfy the Company\u2019s capital needs, the Company is undertaking measures to grow its operations, streamline its cost infrastructure and otherwise increase liquidity by: (i) refinancing or repaying debt to reduce interest costs and mandatory principal repayments, with such repayment to be funded through potentially expanding borrowing arrangements with certain lenders; (ii) increasing future lease revenue through acquisitions and investments in existing properties; (iii) modifying the terms of existing leases; (iv) replacing certain tenants who default on their lease payment terms; and (v) reducing other and general and administrative expenses.\nThe Company anticipates that these actions, if successful, will provide the opportunity to maintain its liquidity, thereby permitting the Company to better meet its operating and financing obligations. However, there is no guarantee that such actions will be successful.\nWe rely on external sources of capital to fund our capital needs, and if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital, we may not be able to make future investments necessary to grow our business or meet maturing debt commitments.\nWe rely on external sources of capital, including, from time to time, private or public offerings of debt or equity, the assumption of secured indebtedness, or mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio. If we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources, then we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including: (i) the performance of the national and global economies generally; (ii) competition in the healthcare industry; (iii) issues facing the healthcare industry, including regulations and government reimbursement policies; (iv) our tenants\u2019 operating costs; (v) the market\u2019s perception of our growth potential; (vi) the market value of our properties; (vii) our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, if any; and (viii) the market price of the shares of our capital stock. We may not be in a position to take advantage of future investment opportunities if we are unable to access capital markets on a timely basis or are only able to obtain financing on unfavorable terms.\nIn particular, we are subject to risks associated with debt financing, which could negatively impact our business and limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repay maturing indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay our maturing indebtedness. Furthermore, if we have to pay higher interest rates in connection with a refinancing, the interest expenses relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase, which could reduce our profitability. Moreover, additional debt financing increases our leverage. The\ndegree of leverage could have important consequences to our shareholders, including affecting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, and making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our results of operations or the economy in general.\nOur ability to raise capital through equity sales is dependent, in part, on the market price of our stock and the terms of our Series A Preferred Stock, including the amount of the undeclared preferred stock dividends in arrears with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock.\nAs with other publicly-traded companies, the availability of equity capital depends, in part, on the market price of our stock, which, in turn, will depend upon various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time, and could negatively impact the market price of our stock, including:\n\u2022\nthe extent of investor interest;\n\u2022\nour financial performance and that of our tenants;\n\u2022\ngeneral stock and bond market conditions; and\n\u2022\nother factors such as governmental regulatory action.\nFurther, our ability to raise capital through equity sales has been adversely affected by the terms of our Series A Preferred Stock and the amount of the undeclared preferred stock dividend in arrears with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, which was $27.9 million as of December 31, 2020.\nCovenants in the agreements evidencing our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations.\nThe terms of our credit agreements and other agreements evidencing our indebtedness require us to comply with a number of financial and other covenants which may limit management\u2019s discretion by restricting our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, and create liens. Any additional financing we may obtain could contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Our continued ability to incur indebtedness and conduct our operations is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. Any such breach could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur assets may be subject to impairment charges.\nWe periodically, but not less than annually, evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions, operator performance and legal structure. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, then we are required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write-off occurs.\nWe may change our investment strategies and policies.\nThe Board, without the approval of our shareholders, may alter our investment strategies and policies if it determines that a change is in our shareholders\u2019 best interests. The methods of implementing our investment strategies and policies may vary as new investments and financing techniques are developed.\nEconomic conditions and turbulence in the credit markets may create challenges in securing indebtedness or refinancing our existing indebtedness.\nDepressed economic conditions, the availability and cost of credit, turmoil in the mortgage market and depressed real estate markets have in the past contributed, and will in the future contribute, to increased volatility and diminished expectations for real estate markets and the economy as a whole. Significant market disruption and volatility could impact our ability to secure indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe price of our stock has fluctuated, and a number of factors may cause the price of our stock to decline.\nThe market price of our stock has fluctuated and may fluctuate significantly in the future, depending upon many factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in our financial condition, performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and market conditions and other external factors;\n\u2022\nthe market price of securities issued by other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships or other transactions;\n\u2022\npress releases or negative publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in healthcare;\n\u2022\ngovernment action or regulation, including changes in federal, state and local healthcare regulations to which our tenants are subject;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates, our ability to meet those estimates, or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\nfuture sales of the common stock, our Series A Preferred Stock or another series of our preferred stock, or debt securities.\nIn addition, the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock also depends upon:\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\ntrading prices of preferred equity securities issued by other companies in our industry; and\n\u2022\nthe annual yield from distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments.\n\u2022\nthe amount of undeclared preferred stock dividends in arrears with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, which was $27.9 million at December 31, 2020.\nFurthermore, the stock market in recent years has experienced sweeping price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. These market fluctuations may also cause the price of our stock to decline.\nIn the event of fluctuations in the price of our stock, shareholders may be unable to resell shares of our stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares. Additionally, due to fluctuations in the price of our stock, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on past results as an indication of future performance.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. This means that, unless accumulated accrued dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods, no dividends may be declared or paid, or set aside for payment on, our common stock. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock the applicable liquidation preference plus all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends.\nWe suspended the quarterly dividend payment with respect to our Series A Preferred Stock commencing with the fourth quarter of 2017, and in June 2018, we determined to continue such suspension indefinitely. As a result of such suspension, the Company has $27.9 million of undeclared preferred stock dividends in arrears as of December 31, 2020. See Part II, Item 7., \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in this Annual Report. As a result, the value of your investment in our common stock may suffer if sufficient funds are not available to first satisfy our obligations to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock in the event of our liquidation.\nThere are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nWe are a holding company, and we have no significant operations. We rely primarily on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us so we may, among other things, pay dividends on our capital stock, if and to the extent declared by the Board. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other distributions to us depends on their earnings and may be restricted in the future by the terms of certain agreements governing their indebtedness. If our subsidiaries are in default under such agreements, then they may not pay dividends or make other distributions to us.\nIn addition, we may only pay dividends on our capital stock if we have funds legally available to pay dividends and such payment is not restricted or prohibited by law, the terms of any shares with higher priority with respect to dividends or any documents governing our indebtedness. We are restricted by Georgia law from paying dividends on our capital stock if we are not able to pay our debts as they become due in the normal course of business or if our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy preferential rights upon dissolution. In addition, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock unless all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payments, for all past dividend periods. In addition, future debt, contractual covenants or arrangements that we or our subsidiaries enter into may restrict or prevent future dividend payments.\nAs such, we are currently unable, on a temporary or permanent basis, to pay dividends on our stock, including our common stock and our Series A Preferred Stock. The payment of any future dividends on our stock will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend, among other things, on the earnings and results of operations of our subsidiaries, their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to us under agreements governing their indebtedness, our financial condition and capital requirements, any debt service requirements and any other factors the Board deems relevant.\nThe Board suspended dividend payments indefinitely with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. Such dividends are currently in arrears since the fourth quarter 2017. See Part II, Item 7., \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d of this Annual Report. As a result of this dividend suspension, no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock until all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment, for all past dividend periods.\nThe costs of being publicly owned may strain our resources and impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. We are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nThese requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources and have required us, and may in the future require us, to hire additional accounting and financial resources with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. In addition, failure to maintain such internal controls could result in us being unable to provide timely and reliable financial information which could potentially subject us to sanctions or\ninvestigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities or cause us to be late in the filing of required reports or financial results. Any of the foregoing events could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe ownership and transfer restrictions contained in the Charter may prevent or restrict you from acquiring or transferring shares of the common stock.\nAs a result of the Merger, the Charter contains provisions restricting the ownership and transfer of the common stock. These ownership and transfer restrictions include that, subject to the exceptions, waivers and the constructive ownership rules described in the Charter, no person (including any \u201cgroup\u201d as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)) may beneficially own, or be deemed to constructively own by virtue of the ownership attribution provisions of the Code, in excess of 9.9% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding common stock. The Charter also prohibits, among other things, any person from beneficially or constructively owning shares of common stock to the extent that such ownership would cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT by reason of being \u201cclosely held\u201d under the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or that would cause the Company to otherwise fail to qualify as a REIT. Furthermore, any transfer, acquisition or other event or transaction that would result in common stock being beneficially owned by less than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution) will be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such common stock. These ownership and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control involving the Company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders.\nProvisions in Georgia law, our Charter and Bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control or management that shareholders may consider desirable.\nVarious provisions of the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the \u201cGBCC\u201d) and the Charter and Bylaws may inhibit changes in control not approved by the Board and may have the effect of depriving our investors of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of the common stock and other securities in the event of an attempted hostile takeover. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the market price of the common stock and other securities. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe ownership and transfer restrictions contained in the Charter with respect to the common stock;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of shareholders be called by the Board, the Chairman, the President, or the holders of shares with voting power of at least 25%;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\na requirement that directors may only be removed for cause and then only by an affirmative vote of at least a majority of all votes entitled to be cast in the election of such directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition of shareholder action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent;\n\u2022\navailability of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock; and\n\u2022\na charter \u201cconstituency\u201d clause authorizing (but not requiring) our directors to consider, in discharging their duties as directors, the effects of the Company\u2019s actions on other interests and persons in addition to our shareholders.\nIn addition, the Company has elected in the Bylaws to be subject to the \u201cfair price\u201d and \u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions of the GBCC. The business combination provisions generally restrict us from engaging in certain business combination transactions with any \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d (as defined in the GBCC) for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless certain designated conditions are met. The fair price provisions generally restricts us from entering into certain business combinations with an interested shareholder unless the transaction is unanimously approved by the continuing directors who must constitute at least three members of the Board at the time of such approval; or the transaction is recommended by at\nleast two-thirds of the continuing directors and approved by a majority of the shareholders excluding the interested shareholder.\nThe Board can use these and other provisions to prevent, delay or discourage a change in control of the Company or a change in our management. Any such delay or prevention of a change in control or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a takeover transaction pursuant to which our shareholders could receive a substantial premium over the current market price of the common stock and other securities, which in turn may limit the price investors might be willing to pay for such securities.\nIf we fail to meet all applicable continued listing requirements of the NYSE American and the NYSE American determines to delist the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, then the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of such securities, impair the value of your investment, adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds and subject us to additional trading restrictions and regulations.\nIf the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are delisted from the NYSE American, such securities may trade in the over-the-counter market. If our securities were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and any security analysts\u2019 coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in such securities, further limiting the liquidity of the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. Such delisting from the NYSE American and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. Any such limitations on our ability to raise debt and equity capital could prevent us from making future investments and satisfying maturing debt commitments.\nIn addition, if the Company fails for 180 or more consecutive days to maintain a listing of the Series A Preferred Stock on a national exchange, then: (i) the annual dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock will be increased from 10.875% per annum to 12.875% per annum on the 181st day; and (ii) the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors to serve on the Board in accordance with, and subject to the requirements of, the Charter. Such increased dividend rate and voting rights will continue for so long as the Series A Preferred Stock is not listed on a national exchange. Additionally as the Company has failed to pay cash dividends on the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in full for more than four consecutive dividends periods, the annual dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock for the fifth and future missed dividend period to has increased to 12.875%; commencing on the first day after the missed fourth quarterly payment (October 1, 2018) and continuing until the second consecutive dividend payment date following such time as the Company has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in full in cash. See Note 11- Common and Preferred Stock to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this Annual Report.", "PERMNO": 91627, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "RHE"}
