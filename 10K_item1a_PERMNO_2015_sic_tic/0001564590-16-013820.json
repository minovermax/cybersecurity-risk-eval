{"cik": "791915", "company": "CYPRESS SEMICONDUCTOR CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nUnfavorable economic and market conditions, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant customer sales both in the U.S. and internationally. We are also reliant upon U.S. and international suppliers, manufacturing partners and distributors. We are therefore susceptible to adverse U.S. and international economic and market conditions. If any of our manufacturing partners, customers, distributors or suppliers experience serious financial difficulties or cease operations, our business will be adversely affected. In addition, the adverse impact of an unfavorable economy on consumers, including high unemployment rates, may adversely impact consumer spending, which will adversely impact demand for consumer products such as certain end products in which our products are embedded. In addition, prices of certain commodities, including oil, metals, grains and other food products, are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. High or volatile commodity prices increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect consumers\u2019 discretionary spending. As a result of the difficulty that businesses (including our customers) may have in obtaining credit, the increasing and/or volatile costs of commodities and the decreased consumer spending that may result from weakness in the general global economy, global economic and market turmoil are likely to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile due to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, and each of which could adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 value.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile due to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nRevenue fluctuations due to unexpected shifts in customer orders;\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements about our earnings or the earnings of our competitors that are not in line with analyst expectations;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to achieve the planned synergies in the recent merger with Spansion;\n\u00b7\nCredit conditions and our ability to refinance our existing debt at commercially reasonable terms, which may limit the Company\u2019s working capital;\n\u00b7\nQuarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, design wins, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nThe perceptions of general market conditions in the semiconductor industry and global market conditions;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to develop and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\nAny major change in our board or senior management;\n\u00b7\nChanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory compliance that impact our business;\n\u00b7\nRecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates concerning us or our customers or competitors;\n\u00b7\nThe volume of short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions on shares of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nEconomic conditions and growth expectations in the markets we serve;\n\u00b7\nChanges in our policy regarding dividends or our ability to declare a dividend; and\n\u00b7\nOur ability to execute our lean inventory initiative to reduce excess inventory, which could lead to a disruption in the supply of our products and adversely affect our business.\nFurther, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. Finally, our executive officers, who may hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock, may from time to time pledge all or a portion of their holdings as collateral or include such holdings in margin accounts. If our stock price were to drop suddenly, such margin accounts could be called and the shares in such accounts may be automatically sold by a third party in the open market, even during a blackout period.\nWe may in the future incur impairments in the value of our goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment annually, and more frequently when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Additionally, our other long-lived assets which include intangibles and property, plant and equipment are evaluated for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Either of these situations may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected income or cash. We continue to evaluate current conditions to assess whether any impairment exists. Impairments could occur in the future if any of the following occur: market or interest rate environments deteriorate, significant adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers, changes in technology, expected future cash flows of our reporting units decline, or reporting unit carrying values change materially compared with changes in respective fair values.\nWe utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, earnings per share and our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nWe routinely incur indebtedness to finance our operations and from time to time we have significant amounts of outstanding indebtedness and substantial debt service requirements. Our amended and restated senior secured credit facility with a group of lenders led by Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., provides for a $540 million revolving credit facility and a $100 million term loan. The credit facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations and covenants under our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. There is no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our existing or any amended credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet payment obligations under indebtedness we may under take from time to time. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. There is no assurance that we will be able to implement any of these alternatives on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under any indebtedness we owe. As of January 3, 2016, our outstanding debt included $449.0 million related to our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, $150 million of 2% Senior Exchange notes assumed from Spansion, $97.2 million Term Loan A, net of costs, $7.2 million of capital leases and $3.0 million of equipment loans. See Note 14 for more information on our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, 2.0% Senior Exchange notes assumed from Spansion and our Term Loan A and Note 19 on our capital leases.\nIf we fail to compete successfully in our highly competitive industry and markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed.\nThe semiconductor industry is intensely competitive. This intense competition results in a difficult operating environment that is marked by erosion of average selling prices over the life of each product and rapid technological change resulting in limited product life cycles. In order to offset selling price decreases, we attempt to decrease the manufacturing costs of our products and to introduce new, higher priced products that incorporate advanced features. If these efforts are not successful or do not occur in a timely manner, or if our newly introduced products do not gain market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry depends on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour success in developing and marketing new products, software platforms and manufacturing technologies and bringing them to market on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\nthe quality and price of our products;\n\u00b7\nthe pace at which customers incorporate our products into their systems, as is sometimes evidenced by design wins;\n\u00b7\nthe diversity of our product lines;\n\u00b7\nthe cost effectiveness of our design, development, manufacturing, support and marketing efforts, especially as compared to our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour success in developing and introducing firmware in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nour customer service and customer satisfaction;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully execute our flexible manufacturing strategy;\n\u00b7\nthe number, strength and nature of our competitors, the markets they target and the rate and success of their technological advances;\n\u00b7\nthe success of certain of our development activity which is a part of our Emerging Technologies business segment;\n\u00b7\nour ability to get competitive terms with our vendors, manufacturing partners and suppliers;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nour access to and the availability of working capital.\nAlthough we believe we currently compete effectively in the above areas to the extent they are within our control, given the pace of change in our industry, our current abilities are not guarantees of future success. If we are unable to compete successfully in this environment, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Spansion\nOn March 12, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Spansion. The success of the transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits from combining the businesses of Cypress and Spansion. We expect to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale, market integration and more automation. However, to realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully combine the businesses of Cypress and Spansion. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction in the amounts and times projected for a number of reasons, including that the integration may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated.\nThe failure to integrate successfully the businesses and operations of Cypress and Spansion in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results.\nPrior to the completion of the transaction, Cypress and Spansion historically operated as independent companies. Our management may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of Cypress and Spansion and their subsidiaries, integrating their technologies, organizations, ERP systems, procedures, policies and operations, as well as addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel. In connection with the acquisition, we are integrating certain operations of Cypress and Spansion, including, among other things, back-office operations, information technology and regulatory compliance. The integration of the two companies will be complex and time consuming, and require substantial resources and effort. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the transaction may disrupt each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with our members and other market participants, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. If we fail to manage the integration of these businesses effectively, our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected, and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the transaction.\nWe have incurred costs in connection with our acquisition of Spansion and will continue to incur costs in connection with the transaction.\nWe have incurred significant costs associated with transaction fees, professional services and other costs related to the transaction and we will continue to incur additional costs, including restructuring costs, in connection with the integration of the business. Specifically, through January 3, 2016, we have incurred $84.6 million for costs in addition to restructuring and other items associated with the merger and integration. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset merger-related and restructuring costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nWe face significant volatility in supply and demand conditions for our products, and this volatility, as well as any failure by us to accurately forecast future supply and demand conditions, could materially and negatively impact our business.\nThe semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in the demand for, and supply of, semiconductors. Demand for our products depends in large part on the continued growth of various electronics industries that use our products, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nautomotive applications including advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), instrument clusters, infotainment systems, body electronics, HVAC controls, event data recorders, powertrains and electric vehicle/hybrid-electric vehicle systems;\n\u00b7\nindustrial systems including factory automation equipment, smart electric meters, aerospace, industrial controls, point-of-sale terminals and test equipment\n\u00b7\nconsumer electronics including wearable electronics, smartphones, gaming consoles, gamepads, remote controls, toys, presenter tools, TVs, set-top boxes and fitness equipment;\n\u00b7\nwireless telecommunications equipment;\n\u00b7\ncomputers and computer-related peripherals;\n\u00b7\nmedical equipment; and\n\u00b7\nnetworking equipment.\nAny downturn, shift in product launch schedule or reduction in the growth of these industries could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, our TrueTouch family of products is highly concentrated in consumer handset markets which are susceptible to changes in the general economy, consumer acceptance, design wins, competition and price.\nWe order materials and build our products based primarily on our internal forecasts, customer and distributor forecasts and secondarily on existing orders, which may be cancelled under many circumstances. Because our markets can be volatile, are based on consumer demand and subject to rapid technological and price changes, our forecasts may be inaccurate, causing us to make too many or too few of certain products.\nAlso, our customers frequently place orders requesting product delivery almost immediately after the order is made, which makes forecasting customer demand even more difficult, particularly when supply is abundant. If we experience inadequate demand or a significant shift in the mix of product orders that makes our existing capacity and capability inadequate, our fixed costs per semiconductor produced will increase, which will harm our financial condition and results of operations. Alternatively, if we should experience a sudden increase in demand, we will need to quickly ramp our inventory and/or manufacturing capacity to adequately respond to our customers. If we or our manufacturing partners are unable to ramp our inventory or manufacturing capacity in a timely manner or at all, we risk losing our customers\u2019 business, which could have a negative impact on our financial performance and reputation.\nIf we fail to develop, introduce and sell new products or fail to develop and implement new technologies, our ability to compete in our end markets will suffer and our financial results could be adversely impacted.\nLike many semiconductor companies, which operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment marked by rapid obsolescence of existing products, our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products that customers choose to buy. Our new products, for example PSoC\u00ae products, BLE, USB-Type C, Traveo and our ETD companies are an important strategic focus for us and therefore, they tend to consume a significant amount of our resources. The new products the market requires tend to be increasingly complex, incorporating more functions and operating at faster speeds than old products. Increasing complexity generally requires smaller features on a chip. This makes manufacturing new generations of products substantially more difficult than prior generations.\nDespite the significant amount of resources we commit to new products, there can be no guarantee that such products will perform as expected or at all, be introduced on time to meet customer schedules or gain market acceptance. If we fail to introduce new product designs or technologies in a timely manner or are unable to manufacture products according to the requirements of these designs, or if our customers do not successfully introduce new systems or products incorporating our products, or market demand for our new products does not materialize as anticipated, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nThe complex nature of our manufacturing activities, our broad product portfolio, and our increasing reliance on third-party manufacturers makes us highly susceptible to manufacturing problems and these problems can have a substantial negative impact on us if they occur.\nMaking semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a tightly controlled, clean environment. Even very small impurities in our manufacturing materials, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer or other problems in the wafer fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous chips on each wafer to be non-functional. We and, similarly, our third party foundry partners, may experience problems in achieving an acceptable success rate in the manufacture of wafers and the likelihood of facing such difficulties is higher in connection with the transition to new manufacturing methods. The interruption of wafer fabrication or the failure to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields at any of our facilities, or the facilities of our third-party foundry partners, would seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also experience manufacturing problems in our assembly and test operations and in the introduction of new packaging materials.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon third parties to manufacture, distribute, generate a significant portion of our product sales, fulfill our customer orders and transport our product. Problems in the performance or availability of these companies could seriously harm our financial performance.\nAlthough many of our products are fabricated in our manufacturing facilities located in Minnesota, Austin, Malaysia and the Philippines, we rely to a significant extent on independent contractors to manufacture and assemble our products. In addition, if market demand for our products exceeds our internal manufacturing capacity and available capacity from our foundry partners, we may seek additional foundry manufacturing arrangements.\nA shortage in foundry manufacturing capacity, which is more likely to occur at times of increasing demand, could hinder our ability to meet demand for our products and therefore adversely affect our operating results. In addition, greater demand for wafers produced by any such foundries without an offsetting increase in foundry capacity raises the likelihood of potential wafer price increases. Our operations would be disrupted if any of our foundry partners terminates its relationship with us or has financial issues and we are unable to arrange a satisfactory alternative to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner. There are also only a few foundry vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture our most advanced products. If we engage alternative sources of supply, we may encounter start-up difficulties, yield issues or incur additional costs. Shipments could be delayed significantly while these sources are qualified for volume production.\nWhile a high percentage of our products are assembled, packaged and tested at our manufacturing facilities located in the Philippines and Malaysia, we rely on independent subcontractors to assemble, package and test the balance of our products. We cannot be certain that these subcontractors will continue to assemble, package and test products for us on acceptable economic and quality terms or at all and it might be difficult for us to find alternatives if they do not do so.\nOur foundry partners and assembly and test subcontractors have operations in locations that may suffer the impact of certain natural disasters, which could impact their ability to provide us with our products. We monitor these events closely, but if one of our third party manufacturing partners were to suffer significant damage to its operations as a result of a natural disaster, our ability to timely meet consumer demand would suffer which would materially harm our results of operations.\nOur channel partners include distributors and resellers. We continue to expand and change our relationships with our distributors. Worldwide sales through our distributors accounted for approximately 71% of our net sales in fiscal year 2015. We rely on many distributors to assist us in creating customer demand, providing technical support and other value-added services to our customers, filling customer orders and stocking our products. We face ongoing business risks due to our reliance on our channel partners to create and maintain customer relationships where we have a limited or no direct relationship. Should our relationships with our channel partners or their effectiveness decline, we face the risk of declining demand which could affect our revenue and results of operations. Our contracts with our distributors may be terminated by either party upon notice. In addition, our distributors are located all over the world and are of various sizes and financial conditions. Any disruptions to our distributors\u2019 operations such as lower sales, lower earnings, debt downgrades, the inability to access capital markets and higher interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe also rely on independent carriers and freight haulers to move our products between manufacturing plants and our customers\u2019 facilities. Transport or delivery problems due to their error or because of unforeseen interruptions in their business due to factors such as strikes, political instability, terrorism, natural disasters or accidents could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately impact our relationship with our customers.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights, as well as those of our subsidiaries, is essential to keeping others from copying the innovations that are critical to our existing and future products. It may be possible for an unauthorized third party to reverse-engineer or decompile our software products. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that, even if patents are issued, they will be respected by third parties. Furthermore, our flexible fab initiative requires us to enter into technology transfer agreements with external partners, providing third party access to our intellectual property and resulting in additional risk. In some cases, these technology transfer and/or license agreements are with foreign companies and subject our intellectual property to regulation in foreign countries which may afford less protection and/or result in increased costs to enforce such agreements or intellectual property rights. We anticipate that we will continue to enter into these kinds of licensing arrangements in the future. Consequently, we may become involved in litigation, in the United States or abroad, to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of invalidity. We are also from time to time involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others\u2019 patents or other intellectual property rights.\nMoreover, a key element of our strategy is to enter new markets with our products. If we are successful in entering these new markets, we will likely be subject to additional risks of potential infringement claims against us as our technologies are deployed in new applications and face new competitors. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights, particularly in certain international markets, making misappropriation of our intellectual property more likely. Patent litigation, if necessary or if and when instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection for our technology, in part through confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. Through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property documentation and other proprietary technology information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, former employees, consultants or third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a product with the same functionality as our technology. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult, and nearly impossible on a worldwide basis. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights, particularly in foreign countries where we do business or where our technology is sold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States or where the enforcement of such laws is not common or effective.\nWe may be involved in intellectual property litigation and face significant expenses as a result of ongoing or future litigation.\nOther companies or entities also have commenced, and may again commence, actions seeking to establish the invalidity of our patents. While we intend to defend these actions vigorously, there is no guarantee of success, and such effort takes significant financial and time resources from the Company. In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, a court or the United States Patent and Trademark Office may invalidate the patent(s) or determine that the patent(s) is not enforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If our patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these patents is limited by a court or USPTO decision, we could be prevented from pursuing certain litigation matters or licensing the invalidated or limited portion of such patents. Such adverse decisions could negatively impact our future, expected revenue.\nIntellectual property litigation is frequently expensive to both the winning party and the losing party and could take up significant amounts of management\u2019s time and attention. In addition, if we lose such a lawsuit, a court could find that our intellectual property rights are invalid, enabling our competitors to use our technology, or require us to pay substantial damages and/or royalties or prohibit us from using essential technologies. For these and other reasons, this type of litigation could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, although in certain instances we may seek to obtain a license under a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights in order to bring an end to certain claims or actions asserted against us, we may not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all. We believe we have meritorious defenses and claims in our current litigation and we intend to defend and pursue such claims vigorously. Unfortunately, such litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties.\nWe face additional problems and uncertainties associated with international operations that could seriously harm us.\nInternational revenues historically accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues. Our manufacturing, assembly, test operations and certain finance operations located in outside of the United States, as well as our international sales offices and design centers, face risks frequently associated with foreign operations including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nthe devaluation of local currencies;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability;\n\u00b7\nlabor issues;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of natural disasters on local infrastructures and economies;\n\u00b7\nchanges in local economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nimport and export controls;\n\u00b7\npotential shortage of electric power supply;\n\u00b7\npotential violations by our international employees or third party agents of international or U.S. laws relevant to foreign operations (such as FCPA) and\n\u00b7\nchanges in tax laws, tariffs and freight rates.\nTo the extent any such risks materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nWe compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to attract, such personnel would harm us.\nTo a greater degree than most non-technology companies, we depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and technical personnel to execute on the strategic initiatives of our business. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain such personnel and to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product and process engineers. We compete for these individuals with certain of our competitors, other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing qualified personnel. Equity awards are critical to our ability to hire and retain such key personnel. In addition, we may also need to significantly increase our cash based compensation to retain such personnel.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted if our Emerging Technologies businesses fail to develop and successfully bring to market new and proprietary products.\nWe have made a financial and personnel commitment to our Emerging Technologies businesses. Despite the significant amount of resources we commit to our Emerging Technologies businesses, there can be no guarantee that such Emerging Technologies businesses will perform as expected or at all, launch new products and solutions as expected or gain market acceptance. If our Emerging Technologies businesses\u2019 fail to introduce new product and solutions or successfully develop new technologies, or if our customers do not successfully introduce new systems or products incorporating the products or solutions offered by our Emerging Technologies businesses or market demand for the products or solutions offered by our Emerging Technologies businesses do not materialize as anticipated, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nAny guidance that we may provide about our business or expected future results may differ significantly from actual results.\nFrom time to time we have shared our views in press releases or SEC filings, on public conference calls and in other contexts about current business conditions and our expectations as to our future results of operations. Correctly identifying the key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, especially in uncertain economic times. Given the complexity and volatility of our business, our analyses and forecasts have in the past and will likely in the future, prove to be materially incorrect. We offer no assurance that such predictions or analyses will ultimately be accurate, and investors should treat any such predictions or analyses with appropriate caution. Any analysis or forecast that we make which ultimately proves to be inaccurate may adversely affect our stock price.\nWe are subject to many different environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and directives, and compliance with them may be costly.\nWe are subject to many different international, federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations related to, among other things, the storage, use, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process, conflict mineral and data privacy legislation, as well as the health and safety regulations related to our employees. Compliance with these regulations can be costly. We cannot assure you that we have been, or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by the regulators. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible, without regard to fault, for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our or our predecessors\u2019 past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances or other environmental damage.\nOver the last several years, there has been increased public awareness of the potentially negative environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing operations. This attention and other factors may lead to changes in environmental regulations that could force us to purchase additional equipment or comply with other potentially costly requirements. If we fail to control the use of, or to adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances under present or future regulations, we could face substantial liability or suspension of our manufacturing operations, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the material composition of our products, including the restrictions on lead and other hazardous substances that apply to specified electronic products put on the market in the European Union, China and California. Other countries, including at the federal and state levels in the United States, are also considering similar laws and regulations. Certain electronic products that we maintain in inventory may be rendered obsolete if they are not in compliance with such laws and regulations, which could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from those products. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they will likely result in additional costs, or in the worst case decreased revenue, and could even require that we redesign or change how we manufacture our products. Such redesigns result in additional costs and possible delayed or lost revenue.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur worldwide operations could be adversely affected if disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, telecommunication or information technology system failures, regulatory or political issues, power or water shortages, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics or other man- made disasters or catastrophic events. While we maintain business interruption insurance for our primary foreign manufacturing operations, we are self-insured for any loss or damage to our primary manufacturing facility. As such, the occurrence of any of these business disruptions for us or our third party manufacturers, partners or customers could result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenue and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our costs and expenses, and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including the Philippines, Malaysia, China and India. We also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in Asia to manufacture and distribute our products. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. However in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event, our revenue, profitability and financial condition could suffer.\nSystem security risks, data protection or privacy breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations and/or harm the reputation of the Company, and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue, increase our expenses, negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business on the cloud. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nPortions of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions have adversely affected us in the past, and in the future could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\nWe maintain self-insurance for certain indemnities we have made to our officers and directors, and if a significant payment were to arise out of such liabilities, it could harm our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur certificate of incorporation, by-laws and indemnification agreements require us to indemnify our officers and directors for certain liabilities that may arise in the course of their service to us. We self-insure with respect to these indemnifiable claims. If we were required to pay a significant amount on account of these liabilities for which we self-insure, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nNew regulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nOn August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to do diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We have undertaken the necessary diligence to determine whether such minerals are used in the manufacture of our products. However, the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, regardless of our findings, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free. The next report is due on May 31, 2016 for the 2015 calendar year.\nChanges in U.S. and International tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially impact our business.\nA majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the U.S. and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the U.S. United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. In the past, the administration has considered initiatives which could substantially reduce our ability to defer U.S. taxes including: limitations on deferral of U.S. taxation of foreign earnings eliminate utilization or substantially reduce our ability to claim foreign tax credits, and eliminate various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S. If any of these proposals are constituted into law, they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), and from time to time we are subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings in other jurisdictions in which we do business, and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes, interest and penalties which will negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, and our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities. The results of these US and certain foreign jurisdiction examinations may result in a decrease of our current estimate of unrecognized tax benefits or increase of actual tax liabilities which could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTax bills are introduced from time to time to reform U.S. taxation of international business activities. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, also recently released guidance covering various topics, including country-by-country reporting, definitional changes to permanent establishment and Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, or BEPS, an initiative that aims to standardize and modernize global tax policy. Depending on the final guidance and legislation ultimately enacted, if any, there may be significant consequences for us due to the large scale of our international business activities.\nIn addition, policies regarding corporate income taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny. As a result, decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to legislative investigation and inquiry, which could result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these investigations and inquiries. As such, the taxes we previously paid may be subject to change and our taxes may increase in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our corporate reputation.\nIf the tax incentive or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated in Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand change or cease to be in effect or applicable, in part or in whole, for any reason, or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentive or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect, the amount of corporate income taxes we have to pay could significantly increase.\nWe have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives. The tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally beginning in 2018, subject in certain cases to potential extensions, which we may or may not be able to obtain. Absent these tax incentives, the corporate income tax rate in these jurisdictions that would otherwise apply to us would be between 20% to 30%. The tax incentives that we have negotiated are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive, we will lose the related tax benefits and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits. Depending on the incentive at issue, we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements. Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows.\nThe accumulation of changes in our shares by \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d could trigger an ownership change for U.S. income tax purposes, in which case our ability to utilize our net operating losses would be limited and therefore impact our future tax benefits.\nCypress is a publicly traded company whose stockholders can change on a daily basis. These changes are beyond our control. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) restricts a company\u2019s ability to benefit from net operating losses if a \u201cSection 382 Ownership Change\u201d occurs. An ownership change for purposes of U.S. tax law Section 382 may result from ownership changes that increase the aggregate ownership of \u201c5-percent stockholders,\u201d by more than 50 percentage points over a testing period, generally three years (\u201cSection 382 Ownership Change\u201d). We experienced a Section 382 Ownership Change upon the acquisition of Spansion. The resulting limitations accompanying the ownership change are reflected in our deferred tax assets with no permanent limitation in our ability to utilize our tax attributes.\nAcquisition and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to integration challenges;\n\u00b7\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire;\n\u00b7\nSuccessfully transitioning the current customer, supplier, foundry and other partnering relationships of the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nIntegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\n\u00b7\nIn the case of acquired companies with global operations, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u00b7\nFailure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technology;\n\u00b7\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u00b7\nPending litigation or other known or unknown claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims by stockholders for breach of fiduciary duties, terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these and other risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or current acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Current and future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition or results. As a result, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not be realized.\nWe invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.\nWe make investments in companies to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives. Such investments include equity instruments of private companies, and many of these instruments are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. These companies range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The success of these companies is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors as well as their ability to secure additional funding, obtain favorable investment terms for future financings, or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings, mergers, and private sales. If any of these companies fail, we could lose all or part of our investment in that company. If we determine that other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity investment in a company in which we have invested, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss.\nWhen the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives, we may decide to dispose of the investment. We may incur losses on the disposal of our investments. Additionally, for cases in which we are required under equity method accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another company's income or loss, such income or loss may impact our earnings. Gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities, gains or losses from equity method investments, and impairment charges for equity and other investments.\nWe may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases.\nOn October 20, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock in an aggregate amount not to exceed $450 million. Although our Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase program, the share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares. The stock repurchase could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice and in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance we will continue to declare dividends and that our cash distributions on common stock will continue to be considered a return of capital.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2011, our Board of Directors adopted a policy pursuant to which the Company would pay quarterly cash distributions on our common stock. We intend to continue to pay such distributions subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash distributions are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of Cypress applicable to the declaration and payment of cash distributions. Based upon our lack of current earnings and profits, in the United States, prior to 2016, these distributions have been treated for income tax purposes as a return of capital.\nFuture distributions may be affected by, among other factors:\n\u00b7\nour views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development;\n\u00b7\nstock repurchase programs;\n\u00b7\nchanges in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws;\n\u00b7\nchanges to our business model; and\n\u00b7\ndebt payments.\nOur distribution payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare distributions in any particular amounts or at all. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that the cash distributions will continue to be treated for income tax purposes as a return of capital. A reduction in our distribution payments or a change in the tax treatment of future distributions could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nIf we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of additional shares for our share-based compensation award programs in the future, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel.\nOur compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, hire, motivate, and retain qualified personnel and our share-based compensation award programs provide us with a competitive compensatory tool for this purpose. The continued use of our share-based compensation program is necessary for us to compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of additional shares for our share-based compensation award programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel.", "PERMNO": 10302, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "CY"}
