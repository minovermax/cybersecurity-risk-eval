{"cik": "850693", "company": "ALLERGAN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nBefore deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. These known and unknown risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to the Allergan Business\nWe operate in a highly competitive business.\nThe pharmaceutical and medical device industries are highly competitive. To be successful in these industries, we must be able to, among other things, effectively discover, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products and effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products, including by communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers and medical professionals. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. This enables them to make greater research and development investments, including the acquisitions of technologies, products and businesses, and spread their research and development costs, as well as their marketing and promotion costs, over a broader revenue base.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce products which are more effective than those developed by our competitors. Developments by our competitors, the entry of new competitors into the markets in which we compete, and the rapid pace of scientific advancement in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries could make our products or technologies less competitive or obsolete. For example, sales of our existing products may decline rapidly if a new product is introduced that represents a substantial improvement over our existing products or that is sold at a lower price. Additionally, if we lose patent coverage for a product, our products may compete against generic products that are as safe and effective as our products, but sold at considerably lower prices. The FDA has substantial discretion in administering the generic drug approval process, and may change current approval policies or adopt new policies that may facilitate the more rapid development and approval of generic products, including products that would compete with our existing products. The introduction of generic products could significantly reduce demand for our products within a short period of time. Certain of our pharmaceutical products also compete with over-the-counter products and other products not regulated by the FDA which may be priced and regulated differently than our products.\nWe also expect to face increasing competition from biosimilar products. Recent U.S. healthcare reform legislation included an abbreviated regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. As a result, we anticipate increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. Title VII of the PPACA and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, create a new licensure framework for biosimilar products, and the FDA issued draft guidance in 2012, which could ultimately subject our biologic products, including Botox\u00ae, to competition. Previously, there had been no licensure pathway for such a follow-on product. Further, Congress recently authorized user fee programs for both generic drugs and biosimilars in the FDASIA. The availability of industry user fees obtained through these new programs may facilitate biosimilar product development and faster approvals of both generic drugs and biosimilars. In the event our biologic products such as Botox\u00ae may become subject to direct competition by a licensed biosimilar, we may rapidly lose a significant portion of our sales of that product.\nWe may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. We cannot assure you that we will successfully obtain or preserve patent protection for the technologies incorporated into our products, or that the protection obtained will be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business. In addition, third parties, including generic drug manufacturers, may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Upon the expiration or loss of necessary intellectual property protection for a product, we may rapidly lose a significant portion of our sales of that product.\nFurthermore, we cannot assure you that our products will not infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. If we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture or sell products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. See Item 3 of Part I of this report, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d for information concerning our current intellectual property litigation.\nOur development efforts may not result in products or indications approved for commercial sale.\nWe must continue to develop, test and manufacture new products or achieve new indications or label extensions for the use of our existing products. Prior to marketing, these new products and product indications must satisfy stringent regulatory standards and receive requisite approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities in the United States and abroad. It typically takes many years to satisfy the regulatory requirements to obtain approval or clearance to market products such as ours and approval timing varies substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product. We may be required to conduct costly and time-intensive clinical trials in order to obtain clearance or approval. The development, regulatory review and approval, and commercialization processes are very expensive and time consuming, costly and subject to numerous factors that may delay or prevent the development, approval or clearance, and commercialization of new products.\nIn addition, any of our product candidates or indications may receive necessary regulatory approvals or clearances only after delays or unanticipated costs. For example, prior to the FDA approval of Botox\u00ae for the prophylactic treatment of headaches in adults with chronic migraine in 2010, we were required to adopt a REMS program addressing the risks related to botulinum toxin spread beyond the injection site and the non-interchangeability of botulinum toxins. Even if we receive regulatory approvals for a new product or indication, the product may later exhibit adverse effects that limit or prevent its widespread use or that force us to withdraw the product from the market or to revise our labeling to limit the indications for which the product may be prescribed.\nFurther, clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists, medical personnel, regulatory personnel, statisticians and others, which differences may delay, limit or prevent further clinical development or regulatory approvals of a product candidate. Also, the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing is unpredictable and varies by product and by the intended use of a product. Of course, there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product.\nFrom time to time, legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced that could alter the review and approval process relating to our products. For example, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA initiated an evaluation of the program and, in the first quarter of 2011, announced numerous actions that are intended to reform the review process governing the clearance of medical devices. In addition, as part of FDASIA, Congress enacted several reforms entitled the Medical Device Regulatory Improvements and additional miscellaneous provisions which will further affect medical device regulation both pre- and post-approval. It is possible that the FDA or other governmental authorities will issue additional regulations further restricting the sale of our present or proposed products. Any change in legislation or regulations that govern the review and approval process relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.\nMoreover, any of our product candidates or indications may fail at any stage, potentially after substantial financial and other resources have been invested in their development. Successful product development in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry is highly uncertain, and very few research and development projects produce a commercial product. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development, such as in early human clinical trials, may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons. For instance, a product candidate may not be effective in treating a specified condition or illness, a product candidate may have harmful side effects in humans or animals, the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, may not approve the product candidate for an intended use, a product candidate may not be economical for us to manufacture and commercialize, or certain of our licensors or partners may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or manufacturing activities.\nOur business and products are subject to extensive government regulation.\nWe are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the United States, principally by the FDA and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and foreign regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those promulgated under the FFDCA and Controlled Substances Act, may subject us to operating restrictions and criminal prosecution, monetary penalties and other disciplinary actions, including, sanctions, warning letters, product seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, suspension, revocation of approvals, or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nAfter our products receive regulatory approval or clearance, we, and our direct and indirect suppliers, remain subject to the periodic inspection of our plants and facilities, review of production processes, and testing of our products to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. For example, the FDA conducts ongoing inspections to determine whether our record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control are in compliance with the cGMPs, the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and other FDA regulations. Adverse findings during regulatory inspections may result in the implementation of REMS programs, completion of government mandated post-marketing clinical studies, and government enforcement action relating to labeling, advertising, marketing and promotion, as well as regulations governing manufacturing controls noted above.\nThe FDA has increased its enforcement activities related to the advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products. In particular, the FDA has increased its scrutiny of our compliance with the agency\u2019s regulations and guidance governing direct-to-consumer advertising. The FDA may limit or, with respect to certain products, terminate our dissemination of direct-to-consumer advertisements in the future, which could cause sales of those products to decline. In addition, certain FDA regulations and federal statutes regulate the promotion of our products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses, which prohibit communications to physicians regarding the prescription of our pharmaceutical and biologic products, and the use of our medical device products, that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling or differ from those tested by us and approved or cleared by the FDA. It is challenging to strictly comply with the complex regulatory requirements related to \u201coff-label\u201d communications and other promotional activities. If our promotional activities fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, guidelines or interpretations, we may be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA or other governmental enforcement authorities.\nDisruptions in our supply chain or failure to adequately forecast product demand could result in significant delays or lost sales.\nThe interruption of our manufacturing processes could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell many of our products. We manufacture certain products, including Botox\u00ae, breast aesthetics and our Juv\u00e9derm\u00ae dermal filler family of products, at a single facility or a single site. Therefore, a significant disruptive event, including a fire or natural disaster, at certain manufacturing facilities or sites could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In the event of a disruption, we may need to build or locate replacement facilities as well as seek and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for these facilities. Accordingly, we may experience substantial production delays, and, if our finished goods inventories are insufficient to meet demand, we may be unable to satisfy customer orders on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe loss of a material supplier could also significantly disrupt our business. In some cases, we obtain components or chemicals used in certain of our products from single sources. If we experience difficulties acquiring sufficient quantities of required materials or products from our existing suppliers, or if our suppliers are found to be non-compliant with the FDA\u2019s QSR, cGMPs or other applicable laws, obtaining the required regulatory approvals to use alternative suppliers may be a lengthy and uncertain process during which we could lose sales.\nAny failure by us to forecast demand for, or to maintain an adequate supply of, the raw material and finished product could result in an interruption in the supply of certain products and a decline in sales of that product. For example, the manufacturing process to create the raw material necessary to produce Botox\u00ae and other products is technically complex and requires significant lead-time. In addition, if our suppliers are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements, we may not be able to produce a sufficient amount of materials or products in a timely manner, which could cause a decline in our sales.\nIncreased concerns over the safety of our products may result in negative publicity or increased regulatory controls on our products.\nThe Company\u2019s reputation is the foundation of our relationships with physicians, patients and other customers. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively impact sentiments toward the Company, our business could suffer. Pharmaceuticals and medical devices are perceived to be dangerous products and our customers may have a number of concerns about the safety of our products whether or not such concerns have a basis in generally accepted science or peer-reviewed scientific research. These concerns may be increased by negative publicity, even if the publicity is inaccurate. For example, consumer groups and certain plaintiffs have alleged that certain uses of Botox\u00ae, including off-label uses, have caused patient injuries and death and have further alleged that we failed to adequately warn patients of the risks relating to Botox\u00ae use. From time to time reports related to the quality and safety of breast implant devices are published, including reports that have suggested\na possible association between anaplastic large cell lymphoma and breast implants, as well as negative reports from regulatory authorities in Europe related to a breast implant manufacturer that is not affiliated with the Company. In addition, government investigations related to the use of our products, but not the efficacy of the products themselves, may cause reputational harm to the Company. Negative publicity-whether accurate or inaccurate-about the efficacy, safety or side effects of our products or product categories, whether involving us or a competitor, could materially reduce market acceptance of our products, cause consumers to seek alternatives to our products, result in product withdrawals and cause our stock price to decline. Negative publicity could also result in an increased number of product liability claims, whether or not these claims have a basis in scientific fact.\nWe are also subject to adverse event reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA or similar bodies in other countries if our products are associated with a death or serious injury, even if there is no available evidence of a causal relationship between the adverse event and the product. Such reports may be publicly released by the FDA and other authorities. For instance, the FDA maintains a public database, known as the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience, or MAUDE, that posts reports of adverse events involving medical devices. The submission of an adverse event report for a pharmaceutical or medical device product to the FDA and its public release on MAUDE, or other public database, does not, by regulation, reflect a conclusion by us or the FDA that the product caused or contributed to the adverse event. However, as part of our post-marketing pharmacovigilance program, we routinely monitor the adverse event reports we receive to identify potential safety issues, known as signals, that may require us to take action with respect to the product, such as a recall or other market action, or to amend our labeling to add the adverse reaction or a new warning or contraindication. The FDA and other regulatory authorities also monitor adverse event reports to identify safety signals, and may take action in connection with that monitoring, including the imposition on us of additional regulatory controls, such as REMS programs and the performance of costly post-approval clinical studies or revisions to our approved labeling, which requirements could limit the indications or patient population for our products or could even lead to the withdrawal of a product from the market. We cannot assure you that the FDA will agree with our assessments of whether a safety signal exists for one of our products. Furthermore, any adverse publicity associated with adverse events for our products, and related post-marketing actions, could cause consumers to seek alternatives to our products, and thereby cause our sales to decline, even if our products are ultimately determined not to have been the primary cause of the adverse event.\nWe are subject to complex government healthcare legislation and reimbursement programs, as well as other cost-containment pressures.\nMany of our products are purchased or reimbursed by federal and state government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, including heath maintenance and managed care organizations. These third-party payors increasingly challenge pharmaceutical and medical device product pricing, which could result in lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments to reform healthcare insurance programs could significantly influence the manner in which pharmaceutical products, biologic products and medical devices are prescribed and purchased. For example, in March 2010, the President of the United States signed the PPACA, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The PPACA, among other things, subjects biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and medical devices, requires manufacturers to participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under Medicare Part D, and promotes programs that increase the federal government\u2019s comparative effectiveness research.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.\nIndividual states have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical and medical device products\nand which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Any legally mandated price controls or utilization of bidding procedures could negatively and materially impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to sell our products to hospitals in the United States also depends in part on our relationships with wholesalers and group purchasing organizations, or GPOs. We sell our pharmaceutical products primarily through wholesalers. These wholesale customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the United States. This distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation as well as developing preferred relationships with retail pharmacy chains. We expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and partnerships with retail pharmacies will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us. In addition, wholesalers may apply pricing pressure through fee-for-service arrangements, and their purchases may exceed customer demand, resulting in reduced wholesaler purchases in later quarters. We cannot assure you that we can manage these pressures or that wholesaler purchases will not decrease as a result of this potential excess buying.\nMany existing and potential customers for our products become members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts, sometimes on an exclusive basis, with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a GPO\u2019s affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a GPO, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and if the GPO has negotiated a strict sole source, market share compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer\u2019s products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the GPO for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to renew contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse impact on our sales, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these contracts at the current or substantially similar terms. If we are unable to keep our relationships and develop new relationships with GPOs, our competitive position would likely suffer.\nWe also encounter similar legislative, regulatory and pricing issues in most countries outside the United States. International operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our pharmaceutical and medical device products. Although we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by future cost-containment measures or other potential legislative or regulatory developments, additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nCompliance with domestic and international laws and regulations pertaining to the privacy and security of health information may be time consuming, difficult and costly.\nFailure to comply with domestic and international privacy and security laws can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties. The costs of compliance with these laws, including protecting electronically stored information from cyber attacks, and potential liability associated with failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various domestic and international privacy and security regulations, including but not limited to HIPAA. HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA.\nWhile we currently expend significant resources to protect against cyber attacks and security breaches, we may need to expend additional significant resources in the future to continue to protect against potential security breaches or to address problems caused by such attacks or any breach of our safeguards. A party that is able to circumvent our security safeguards could, among other things, misappropriate or misuse sensitive or confidential information, user information or other proprietary information, cause significant interruptions in our operations and impair our ability to conduct our business, comply with regulations, and adversely impact our customers during the occurrence of any such incident.\nIf we market products in a manner that violates healthcare fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical or medical device manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, formulary\nmanagers and other health care related professions, on the other hand. Based on legislative clarification, a person or entity is not required to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent in order to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration could be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.\nThe Physician Payment Sunshine Act also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device and drug manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. In addition, device and drug manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties. Manufacturers were required to begin data collection on August 1, 2013 and report such data to CMS by March 31, 2014 and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, including reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates and engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered off-label uses.\nHIPAA created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nThe majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to these federal laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. In addition, some states, including California, have laws and regulations that require pharmaceutical companies to adopt comprehensive compliance programs. We have adopted and implemented a compliance program which we believe satisfies the requirements of these laws, regulations and industry codes.\nSanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, mandatory compliance programs, exclusion of a manufacturer\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other similar governmental regulations to which we are subject, we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nWe remain subject to government investigations and related subpoenas. Such investigations and subpoenas are often associated with previously filed qui tam actions, or lawsuits filed under seal under the False Claims Act, or FCA, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 et seq. Qui tam actions are brought by private plaintiffs suing on behalf of the federal government for alleged FCA violations. We may currently be subject to investigation for alleged FCA violations pursuant to qui tam actions, which may be under full or partial seal. The time and expense associated with responding to such subpoenas, and any related qui tam or other actions, may be extensive, and we cannot predict the results of such actions. The costs of responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties (including under the FCA), settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business. For example, in September 2010, we announced that we reached a settlement with the Department of Justice regarding our alleged sales and marketing practices in connection with certain therapeutic uses of Botox\u00ae. As part of the settlement, we entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. Failure to comply with the terms of the Corporate Integrity Agreement could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and being excluded from government health care programs, which could materially reduce our sales and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nWe are subject to the FCPA which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act, which went into\neffect in the third quarter of 2011, which also prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for companies to fail to prevent bribery. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and our agents comply with the FCPA and similar laws, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or related laws for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries with respect to our business. Failure to comply with the FCPA or related laws governing the conduct of business with foreign government entities could disrupt our business and lead to severe criminal and civil penalties, including criminal and civil fines, loss of our export licenses, suspension of our ability to do business with the federal government, denial of government reimbursement for our products and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Other remedial measures could include further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies, and controls and potential personnel changes and/or disciplinary actions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We could also be adversely affected by any allegation that we violated such laws.\nIllegal imports and counterfeit products may reduce demand for our products.\nThe illegal importation of counterfeit products and pharmaceutical and medical device products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect our sales and profitability in the United States and other countries in which we operate. Foreign imports are illegal under current U.S. law, with the sole exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs imported for personal use. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain these lower priced imports has grown significantly. In addition, U.S. policy makers may expand consumers\u2019 ability to import lower priced versions of our products and competing products from Canada, where there are government price controls. Any future legislation or regulations that increase consumer access to lower priced medicines from outside the United States could adversely impact our revenues.\nLitigation may harm our business or otherwise distract our management.\nSubstantial, complex or extended litigation is unpredictable and could cause us to incur large expenditures, affect our ability to market and distribute our products and distract our management. For example, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, customers or competitors could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with such companies or individuals are not uncommon, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to resolve disputes on favorable terms. See Item 3 of Part I of this report, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d for information concerning our current litigation.\nWe may experience losses due to product liability claims, product recalls or corrections.\nThe design, development, manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability or other claims by consumers and other third parties. We have been in the past, and continue to be, subject to various product liability lawsuits, product recalls and requirements to issue field corrections related to our products due to manufacturing deficiencies, labeling errors or other safety or regulatory reasons.\nOur pharmaceutical and medical device products may cause, or may appear to cause, serious adverse side effects or potentially dangerous drug interactions if misused, improperly prescribed, improperly implanted or subject to faulty surgical technique. For example, the manufacture and sale of breast implant products has been and continues to be the subject of a significant number of product liability claims due to allegations that the medical devices cause disease or result in complications, rare lymphomas and other health conditions due to rupture, deflation or other product failure. In addition to product liability claims, in the event of a breast implant rupture or deflation that requires surgical intervention with respect to our breast implant products sold and implanted, our warranty programs may require us to replace the product. Furthermore, we face a substantial risk of product liability claims from our eye care, neuromodulator, urology, skin care and facial aesthetics products.\nWe are largely self-insured for future product liability losses related to all of our products. We have historically been and continue to be self-insured for any product liability losses related to our breast implant products. Our self-insurance program is based on historical loss trends, and we can provide no assurance that our self-insurance program accruals will be adequate to cover future losses, and our third-party insurance coverage may be inadequate to satisfy any other covered liabilities we might incur.\nIf third parties with whom we collaborate do not perform, we may not be able to develop and market products as anticipated.\nWe have entered into collaborative arrangements with third parties to develop, manufacture and market certain products. We cannot assure you that these collaborations will be successful, lead to additional sales of our products or lead to the creation of additional products. Our dependence on collaborative arrangements with third parties subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to fully control the amount and timing of resources our collaborative partners may devote to products based on the collaboration, and our partners may choose to pursue alternative products to the detriment of our collaboration;\n\u2022\ncounterparties may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022\nwe could become involved in disputes with counterparties, which could lead to delays or termination of the collaborations and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration; and\n\u2022\ncounterparties can terminate the collaboration agreement under certain circumstances.\nAcquisitions of technologies, products, and businesses or the sale of our assets could disrupt our business, involve increased expenses and present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.\nWe regularly consider and, as appropriate, make acquisitions of technologies, products and businesses that we believe are complementary to our business. Acquisitions typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel, technologies and products acquired, some of which may result in significant charges to earnings. Issues that must be addressed in acquiring and integrating the acquired technologies, products and businesses into our own include:\n\u2022\nconforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, operating divisions, business cultures and compensation structures;\n\u2022\nretaining key employees;\n\u2022\nretaining existing customers and attracting new customers;\n\u2022\nconsolidating operational infrastructure, including information technology, accounting systems and administration;\n\u2022\nmitigating the risk of unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nmanaging tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business, we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, which may materially adversely affect our business, and our ability to develop and introduce new products. Actual costs and sales synergies, if achieved at all, may be lower than we expect and may take longer to achieve than we anticipate. Furthermore, the products of companies we acquire may overlap with our products or those of our customers, creating conflicts with existing relationships or with other commitments that are detrimental to the integrated businesses.\nWe may not complete acquisitions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, which could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. The failure to consummate an acquisition may be caused by, among other reasons, occurrence of a material adverse change of the company we propose to acquire or an order to restrain, enjoin or prohibit the transaction is made by a court or other governmental entity.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may also sell some of our assets. There can be no assurance that any such sale will be completed in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, on terms favorable to us, or at all. The sale of assets typically entails numerous potential risks, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of resources and management\u2019s attention from the operation of the business;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees following such a transaction;\n\u2022\ninsufficient proceeds to offset transaction related expenses;\n\u2022\nnegative effects on our reported results of operations from disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our existing customer and supplier relationships.\nAdverse U.S. or international economic conditions may negatively affect our business.\nAdverse U.S. or international economic conditions or a decline of global or country-specific financial markets may reduce consumer demand for our products. Many of our products have limited reimbursement or are not reimbursable by governmental or other healthcare plans. Instead, these products are partially or wholly paid for directly by the consumer. Adverse economic and market conditions could also have a negative impact on our business by negatively affecting the parties with whom we do business, including among others, our customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, creditors, collaboration partners and other third parties with whom we do business.\nWe also collect and pay a substantial portion of our sales and expenditures in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We routinely monitor our transaction exposure to currency rates and implement certain economic hedging strategies to limit such exposure; however, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including a currency devaluation in one or more foreign\ncountries, could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that future exchange rate movements, inflation or other related factors will not have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include, among other things:\n\u2022\nreductions in the reimbursement amounts we receive for our products from foreign governments and foreign insurance providers;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements, including quality standards and other certification requirements;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in trade protection measures, including tariffs and export license requirements;\n\u2022\navailability of foreign exchange for imports; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in coordinating and managing foreign operations, including ensuring that foreign operations comply with foreign laws as well as U.S. laws applicable to U.S. companies with foreign operations, such as export laws and the FCPA.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations, changes in our interpretations of tax laws, including pending tax law changes, changes in our manufacturing activities and changes in our future levels of research and development spending. In that regard, there have been a number of recent proposals, including by Congress and the Treasury as well as various government appointed and outside commissions, that could substantially impact the U.S. taxation of U.S. based multinational corporations such as Allergan. In addition, certain U.S. federal income tax provisions, including a research and development tax credit that provides a tax benefit on certain research and development expenditures, expired at the end of 2014, and it is unclear whether Congress will extend the applicability of such provisions into future years. The permanent loss of the research and development tax credit would adversely affect our effective tax rate and our profitability.\nWe generally do not collect or pay state sales or other tax on sales of certain products, including Botox\u00ae, Botox\u00ae Cosmetic, our dermal fillers and breast implants. Changes in applicable tax laws that require us to collect and pay state sales or other taxes, and penalties, associated with prior, current or future years on sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and profitability due to the increased cost associated with those products.\nIn addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other local, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our estimated income tax liabilities. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and estimated income tax liabilities.\nThe terms of our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business.\nOur indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and, consequently, place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in new business activities. For example, our debt agreements restrict our ability to, among other things, incur liens or engage in sale lease-back transactions and engage in consolidations, mergers and asset sales.\nIn addition, our debt agreements include financial covenants that we maintain certain financial ratios. As a result of these covenants and ratios, we have certain limitations on the manner in which we can conduct our business, and we may be restricted from engaging in favorable business activities or financing future operations or capital needs. Accordingly, these restrictions may limit our ability to successfully operate our business. Failure to comply with the financial covenants or to maintain the financial ratios contained in our debt agreements could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that our future operating results will be sufficient to ensure compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements or to remedy any such default. In addition, in the event of any default and related acceleration of obligations, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments.\nFailure to retain, motivate and recruit executives and other key employees may negatively affect our business.\nWe must continue to retain, motivate and recruit executives and other key employees. A failure by us to retain and motivate executives and other key employees could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe are exposed to the risk of environmental liabilities.\nOur product development programs and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and toxic compounds. These programs and processes expose us to risks that an accidental contamination could lead to noncompliance with environmental laws, regulatory enforcement actions and claims for personal injury and property damage. In addition, we may be subject to clean-up obligations, damages and fines related to the discharge of hazardous materials, chemicals and toxic compounds on our properties whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. For example, in connection with the acquisition and ownership of our properties, we may be potentially liable for environmental clean-up costs.\nEnvironmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which our products are manufactured or formulated and on how our properties may be used or our business may be operated. Environmental laws provide for sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Any costs or expenses relating to environmental matters may not be covered by insurance and, accordingly, may have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nNatural disasters and geo-political events could adversely affect our business.\nWe are a global company with sales and marketing subsidiaries in approximately 40 countries and are present in over 100 countries, as supplemented by distributors. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods and tornados, or severe changes in geo-political events, such as wars, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers or distributors are located, could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, properties or assets that are important to us or to our suppliers or distributors, changes in consumers\u2019 income or purchasing patterns, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products to us, or disruption in the distribution of our products. Any such events and their consequences are unpredictable and could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or distributors and could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nOur stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Our stock price is also subject to fluctuation based on a variety of external factors unrelated to our revenues or operating results.\nOur publicly filed SEC reports may be reviewed by the SEC.\nThe reports of publicly traded companies are subject to review by the SEC from time to time for the purpose of assisting companies in complying with applicable disclosure requirements and to enhance the overall effectiveness of companies\u2019 public filings, and comprehensive reviews of such reports are now required at least every three years under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The SEC reviews may be initiated at any time. While we believe that our previously filed SEC reports comply, and we intend that all future reports will comply in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC, we could be required to modify or reformulate information contained in prior filings as a result of an SEC review. Any modification or reformulation of information contained in such reports could be significant and could result in material liability to us and have a material adverse impact on the market value of our common stock.\nFailure to effectively implement organizational changes could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, we undertake organizational changes, including restructuring actions, to support or execute our strategic objectives. A failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and results of operations. For example, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of organizational changes, and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations.\nRisks Related to Our Pending Merger with Actavis\nThe anticipated benefits of the Actavis Merger may not be realized or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe success of the proposed acquisition of the Company by Actavis plc, or the Actavis Merger, will depend, to a large extent, on the ability of Actavis plc, or Actavis, to integrate the two organizations and businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we and Actavis will be required to devote significant management attention and resources prior to closing to prepare for integrating, and Actavis will be required to devote significant management attention and resources post-closing to integrate the business practices and operations of both organizations. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect the results of operations of the combined company. In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth;\n\u2022\nprospects from the combination;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\nconforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the Actavis Merger;\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating a geographically dispersed organization.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if our operations are integrated successfully with Actavis, the full benefits of the transactions may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business with Actavis. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of Actavis, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transactions, and negatively impact the price of Actavis ordinary shares. As a result, it cannot be assured that our combination with Actavis will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transactions contemplated by the Actavis Merger Agreement.\nWe will incur costs as a result of the Actavis Merger.\nWe will incur substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the Actavis Merger and, over a period of time following the completion of the Actavis Merger. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately.\nOur stockholders cannot be sure of the market price of the Actavis ordinary shares they will receive as a portion of the Actavis Merger consideration.\nAs a result of the Actavis Merger, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock, other than excluded shares and dissenting shares, will be converted into the right to receive 0.3683 of an Actavis ordinary share and $129.22 in cash, without interest. The market price of Actavis ordinary shares which our stockholders will receive, are subject to general price fluctuations in the market for publicly traded equity securities and have experienced volatility in the past. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions and changes in the respective businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations of Actavis. Market assessments of the benefits of the Actavis Merger and the likelihood\nthat the Actavis Merger will be completed, as well as the terms of Actavis\u2019 debt financing and general and industry specific market and economic conditions, may also impact market prices of Actavis ordinary shares. Equity offerings that Actavis intends to partially finance the Actavis Merger may also cause the share price of Actavis ordinary shares to decrease.\nWe and Actavis must obtain required approvals and consents to consummate the Actavis Merger, which if delayed or not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions, may prevent, delay or jeopardize the consummation of the Actavis Merger, result in additional expenditures of money and resources and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of the Actavis Merger.\nThe Merger is subject to customary closing conditions. These closing conditions include, among others, the receipt of required approvals by the Actavis shareholders and our stockholders, the clearances of the Actavis Merger by certain governmental and regulatory authorities, including multiple governmental and regulatory authorities, and the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or HSR Act, and the antitrust and competition laws of certain foreign countries under which filings or approvals are or may be required. On January 9, 2015, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, satisfying one of the regulatory conditions required to close the Actavis Merger. The governmental agencies with which the parties will make these filings and seek certain of these approvals and consents have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. We can provide no assurance that all required approvals and consents will be obtained. Moreover, as a condition to their approval of the transaction, certain governmental agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the business of the combined company after the closing of the Actavis Merger. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the effective time of the Actavis Merger or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. Further, no assurance can be given that the required Actavis shareholder and Allergan stockholder approvals will be obtained or that the required closing conditions will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the closing conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or clearances. If we and Actavis agree to any material requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions in order to obtain any approvals or clearances required to consummate the transaction, these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could adversely affect Actavis\u2019 ability to integrate our operations with their operations and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transactions. This could result in a failure to consummate the transactions or have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company.\nOur stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Actavis Merger and will exercise less influence over management.\nOur stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of our board of directors and on other matters affecting us. Upon the completion of the Actavis Merger, each of our stockholders will become a shareholder of Actavis with a percentage ownership of Actavis that is smaller than the stockholder\u2019s prior percentage ownership of us. Because of this, our stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies of Actavis than they now have on our management and policies.\nWhile the Actavis Merger is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Actavis Merger on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Actavis Merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others who deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us. Employee retention may be challenging during the pendency of the Actavis Merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the businesses, the business of the combined company following the Actavis Merger could be seriously harmed. In addition, the Actavis Merger Agreement restricts us from taking specified actions until the Actavis Merger occurs without the consent of the other party. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Actavis Merger.\nOur directors and officers may have interests in the Actavis Merger different from the interests of our stockholders.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers negotiated the terms of the Actavis Merger Agreement, and our board of directors approved the Actavis Merger Agreement and recommended that our stockholders vote in favor of the Actavis Merger. These directors and executive officers may have interests in the Actavis Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. These interests include, but are not limited to, the continued employment of certain of our executive officers by Actavis, the continued service of certain of our directors as directors of Actavis, the treatment in the Actavis Merger of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, bonus awards, change of control employment agreements and other rights held by our directors and executive officers, and provisions in the Actavis Merger Agreement regarding continued indemnification of and advancement of expenses to our directors and officers.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to pursue alternatives to the Actavis Merger and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay Actavis a termination fee of up to $2.1 billion.\nUnder the Actavis Merger Agreement, we are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, from soliciting, initiating, knowingly encouraging or facilitating, discussing or negotiating, or furnishing information with regard to, any inquiry, proposal or offer for a competing acquisition proposal. Under certain circumstances, we may terminate the Actavis Merger Agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, if our board of directors (after consultation with our financial advisors and legal counsel) determines that such proposal is more favorable to our stockholders (taking into account any changes to the Actavis Merger Agreement proposed by Actavis within four business days of Actavis\u2019 receipt of the terms of such proposal, or within three business days of Actavis\u2019 receipt of any material amendment to such proposal) than the Actavis Merger. If our board of directors recommends such superior proposal to our stockholders but does not terminate the Actavis Merger Agreement, Actavis would be entitled to terminate the Actavis Merger Agreement. Under either of these circumstances, we would be required to pay Actavis a termination fee equal to $2.1 billion. In the event the Actavis Merger Agreement is terminated due to the failure of our stockholders to adopt the Actavis Merger Agreement at the Allergan special meeting, we would be required to pay Actavis for up to $680 million of Actavis\u2019 expenses related to the transactions contemplated by the Actavis Merger Agreement. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to enter into a transaction that would be more favorable to us than the Actavis Merger, or might result in a third party proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee or expense reimbursement that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nTermination of the Actavis Merger Agreement could negatively affect us.\nOur business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Actavis Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Actavis Merger. If the Actavis Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Actavis Merger will be completed.", "PERMNO": 75646, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "AGN.2"}
