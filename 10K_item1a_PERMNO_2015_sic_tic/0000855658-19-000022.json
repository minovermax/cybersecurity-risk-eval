{"cik": "855658", "company": "LATTICE SEMICONDUCTOR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered before making an investment decision relating to our common stock. If any of the risks described below occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial results.\nWe rely on a concentrated number of subcontractors to supply and fabricate silicon wafers for our semiconductor products. If they are unable to do so on a timely and cost-effective basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, we may incur significant costs or delays.\nWe rely on a concentrated number of independent foundries in Asia to supply and fabricate silicon wafers for our semiconductor products, including Fujitsu, United Microelectronics Corporation, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and Seiko Epson. Our success is dependent upon our ability to successfully partner with our foundry partners and their ability to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes and prices. Establishing, maintaining and managing multiple foundry relationships requires the investment of management resources as well as costs. If we fail to maintain our foundry relationships, if our foundry partners do not provide facilities and support for our development efforts, or if we elect or are required to change foundries, we may incur significant costs and delays. If our foundry partners are unable to, or do not, manufacture sufficient quantities of our products at acceptable yields, we may be required to allocate the affected products among our customers, prematurely limit or discontinue the sales of certain products, or incur significant costs to transfer products to other foundries, which could adversely affect our customer relationships and operating results.\nAny adverse change in our relationship with our distributors or our distributors' performance could harm our sales.\nWe depend on a concentrated group of distributors to sell our products to end customers, complete order fulfillment, and maintain sufficient inventory of our products. Our distributors also provide technical support and other value-added services to our end customers. In fiscal 2018, revenue attributable to distributors accounted for 83% of our total revenue, with two distributors accounting for 54% of total revenue. In fiscal 2017, distributors accounted for 77% of our total revenue with two distributors accounting for 51% of total revenue. We have significant outstanding receivables with our top distributors, and expect our distributors to generate a significant portion of our revenue in the future. Any adverse change to our relationships with our distributors or a failure by one or more of our distributors to perform its obligations to us could have a material impact on our business. A significant reduction of effort by a distributor to sell our products, a material change in our relationship with one or more distributors, or a reduction in the financial health of our distributors may result in the inability of distributors to effectively perform services on our behalf or pay receivables, reduce our access to certain end customers, or adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nOur success and future revenue depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products that achieve customer and market acceptance.\nWe compete in a dynamic environment characterized by rapid technology and product evolution, generally followed by a relatively longer process of ramping up to volume production on advanced technologies. Our markets are also characterized by evolving industry standards, frequent new product introduction, short product life cycles, and increased demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometry. Our competitive position and success depends on our ability to innovate, develop, and introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power consumption, form factor, and performance, and our addressing the evolving needs of the markets we serve. These new products typically are more technologically complex than their predecessors. In addition, we expect revenue related to mature products to decline over time in a normal product life cycle. As a result, we may be increasingly dependent on revenue derived from our newer products.\nOur future growth and the success of new product introductions depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ntimely completion and introduction of new product designs;\n\u2022\nability to generate new design opportunities and design wins, including those which result in sales of significant volume;\n\u2022\nachievement of necessary volume of production to achieve acceptable cost;\n\u2022\navailability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products;\n\u2022\nability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies;\n\u2022\nachieving acceptable yields and obtaining adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors;\n\u2022\nability to obtain advanced packaging;\n\u2022\navailability of supporting software design tools;\n\u2022\nutilization of predefined IP logic;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our HDMI-enabled and mobile products;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of advanced features in our new products;\n\u2022\navailability of competing alternative technologies; and\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our customers' products.\nThe failure of any of these factors, among others, could adversely affect our product innovation, development and introduction efforts and our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur global business operations expose us to various economic, legal, regulatory, political, and business risks.\nWe have significant international operations, including foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors, which account for the majority of our revenue, and operational and research and development sites in China, the Philippines, and other Asian locations. In addition, we purchase our wafers from foreign foundries; have our commercial products assembled, packaged, and tested by subcontractors located outside of the United States; and rely on an international service provider for inventory management, order fulfillment, and direct sales logistics.\nThese and other integral business activities outside of the United States are subject to the operational challenges, risks and uncertainties associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments including trade barriers; political instability, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, economic sanctions; weak economic conditions, environmental regulations; labor regulations; import and export regulations; tax or freight rates, duties; trade restrictions; interruptions in transportation or infrastructure, changes in trade policies; anti-corruption laws; domestic and foreign governmental regulations; potential vulnerability of and reduced protection for intellectual property; disruptions or delays in production or shipments; and instability or fluctuations in currency exchange rates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the operations of one of our international customers, distributors or service providers and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with the many laws and regulations to which we are subject, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, which could harm our business and financial results. For example, effective May 2018, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and non-compliance monetary penalties of up to the higher of 20 million Euros or 4% of worldwide revenue. Any inability or perceived inability to adequately comply with applicable laws or regulations, including GDPR, could result in additional cost and liability to our business and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political instability, including as a result of terrorist activity, U.S. or other military actions, actions against our customers, the United Kingdom referendum in June 2016 (commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"), or economic crises in countries where our main wafer suppliers, end customers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers are located.\nThe semiconductor industry routinely experiences cyclical market patterns and a significant industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur revenue and gross margin can fluctuate significantly due to downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry. These downturns can be severe and prolonged and can result in price erosion and weak demand for our products. Weak demand for our products resulting from general economic conditions affecting the end markets we serve or the semiconductor industry specifically and reduced spending by our customers can result, and in the past has resulted, in diminished product demand, high inventory levels, erosion of average prices, excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory write-downs. Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations of future sales. Many of our expenses, particularly those relating to facilities, capital equipment, and other overhead, are relatively fixed. We might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales. Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, any significant upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased competition for access to raw materials and third-party service providers. The dynamics of the markets in which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and other factors, our past results are not reliable predictors of our future results and cyclical changes in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our operating results.\nGeneral economic conditions and deterioration in the global business environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAdverse economic conditions or our customers\u2019 perceptions of the economic environment may negatively affect customer demand for our products and services and result in delayed or decreased spending. Several factors contribute to these weak economic conditions, including volatility in the financial markets, lower levels of consumer liquidity, higher interest rates, price increases for materials and components, and political uncertainty. Weak global economic conditions in the past have resulted in weak demand for our products in certain geographies and had an adverse impact on our results of operations. If global economic conditions weaken, our business could be harmed due to customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders. In addition, the inability of customers to obtain credit, the insolvency of one or more customers, tariffs applicable to our customers\u2019 products, or the insolvency of key suppliers could result in sales or production delays. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables, require additional restructuring actions, and decrease our revenue and profitability. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nOur business depends on the proper functioning of internal processes and information technology systems, and failure of these processes and systems may cause business disruptions.\nWe rely on various information technology (\"IT\") networks and systems to manage our operations, including financial reporting, and we regularly make changes to improve them as necessary by periodically implementing new, or upgrading or enhancing existing, operational and IT systems, procedures, and controls. These systems are supported by subcontractors, and they may also be subject to power and telecommunication outages or other general system failures. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and data privacy is complex and evolving. We have recently undergone a significant integration and systems implementation that included implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system to standardize our processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities. We committed significant resources to this new ERP system, which replaced multiple legacy systems. We are focused on realizing the full analytical functionality of this conversion, which is extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes that must be integrated.\nDuring our use of the new ERP system and our other information technology systems, we may experience delays or disruptions in the integration of our new or enhanced systems, procedures, or controls. The policies and security measures established with our new ERP system and other information technology systems may be vulnerable to data breaches, cyber-attacks or fraud. We may also encounter errors in data, an inability to accurately process or record transactions, and security or technical reliability issues. All of these could harm our ability to conduct core operating functions such as processing invoices, shipping and receiving, recording and reporting financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis, and could impact our internal control compliance efforts. If the technical solution or end user training are inadequate, it could limit our ability to manufacture and ship products as planned. We have various systems that remain that may be nearing the end of their useful life or vendor support, which will ultimately need to be replaced. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties or delays in maintaining, managing, and integrating them could adversely affect the Company\u2019s controls and procedures and could impact the Company's ability to perform necessary operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nData breaches and cyber-attacks and cyber-fraud could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information or result in losses.\nWe maintain sensitive data on our networks and the networks of our business partners and third-party providers, including proprietary and confidential information relating to our intellectual property, personnel, and business, and that of our customers and third-party providers. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking, phishing, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access or engage in fraudulent behavior. Cyber-attacks have become more prevalent, sophisticated and much harder to detect and defend against and it is often difficult to anticipate or detect such incidents and to assess the damage caused by them. Our policies and security measures cannot guarantee security, and our information technology infrastructure, including our networks and systems, may be vulnerable to data breaches, cyber-attacks or fraud. In the past, third parties have attempted to penetrate and/or infect our network and systems with malicious software and phishing attacks in an effort to gain access to our network and systems. In addition, we are subject to the risk of third parties falsifying invoices and similar fraud, frequently by obtaining unauthorized access to our vendors\u2019 and business partners\u2019 networks.\nIn some circumstances, we may partner with third-party providers and provide them with certain sensitive data. If these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, this sensitive data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive data could compromise our intellectual property, expose sensitive business information and subject us to third party claims.\nThe increase in cyber-attacks has resulted in an increased focus on cybersecurity by certain government agencies. Cyber-attacks or any investigation or enforcement action related to cybersecurity could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations, and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. In addition, we may incur loss as a result of cyber-fraud, such as those experienced by other companies by making unauthorized payments irrespective of robust internal controls.\nOur reputation, brand, and business could be significantly harmed, and we could be subject to third-party claims or governmental penalties in the event of such a security breach.\nOur outstanding indebtedness could reduce our strategic flexibility and liquidity and may have other adverse effects on our results of operations.\nAs of December 29, 2018, we had approximately $263.0 million outstanding under a Credit Agreement, dated March 10, 2015 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our U.S. subsidiaries, and include a requirement to pay quarterly installments of approximately $0.9 million and up to 75% of our annual excess cash flow toward repayment of the facility, with the remaining balance due upon maturity in March 2021. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon our operating and financial performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to service our debt, we may need to sell material assets, restructure or refinance our debt, or seek additional equity capital. Prevailing economic conditions and global credit markets could adversely impact our ability to sell material assets, restructure or refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or we may not be able to restructure or refinance our debt without incurring significant additional fees and expenses.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets, payment of dividends, and additional indebtedness. The amount and terms of our indebtedness, as well as our credit rating, could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures, and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nour cash flow from operations may be allocated to the payment of outstanding indebtedness, and not to research and development, operations or business growth;\n\u2022\nwe might not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or other sources to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the facility and to fund other liquidity needs;\n\u2022\nour ability to make distributions to our stockholders in a sale or liquidation may be limited until any balance on the facility is repaid in full; and\n\u2022\nour ability to incur additional debt, including for working capital, acquisitions, or other needs, is more limited.\nIf we breach a loan covenant, the lenders could accelerate the repayment of the facility. We might not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness upon acceleration. If we are unable to repay or refinance the indebtedness upon acceleration or at maturity, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding against us or collection proceedings with respect to our assets and subsidiaries securing the facility, which could materially decrease the value of our common stock.\nWe depend on a concentrated group of end customers for a significant portion of our revenues. If any of these end customers reduce their use of our products, our revenue could decrease significantly.\nA significant portion of our revenue depends on sales to a concentrated number of customers. In fiscal 2018, even though no individual end customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, our top five end customers accounted for approximately 18% of our total revenue. If our relationships with any material customers were to diminish, if these customers were to develop their own solutions or adopt alternative solutions or competitors' solutions, if any one or more of our concentrated groups of customers were to experience significantly adverse financial conditions, or if as a result of trade disputes or sanctions these customers were restricted from purchasing our products, our results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our customer's continued use of our products is frequently reevaluated, as certain of our customers' product life cycles are relatively short and they continually develop new products. The selection process for our products to be included in our customers' new products is highly competitive. There are no guarantees that our products will be included in the next generation of products introduced by these customers.\nWe may be unable to successfully develop and produce products on smaller geometries.\nTo remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller nanometer geometries. Continual transition requires new and changes to existing manufacturing process technologies, which could have significantly higher mask and prototyping costs, as well as additional expenditures for engineering design tools. We may determine that we cannot transition on a cost-effective basis; and therefore not offer a competitive product.\nIn addition to costs, we depend on our relationships with our foundry partners to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our foundry partners are limited by their existing obligations and technological capabilities. We make no assurance that our foundry partners would be able to effectively manage a transition of our products to smaller nanometer geometries in a timely manner, or at all. If we or any of our foundry partners experience significant delays in or fail to efficiently implement a transition to smaller process geometries, we could experience reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries, and increased expenses, all of which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial condition and operating results.\nOur business could suffer as a result of tariffs and trade sanctions or similar actions.\nThe imposition by the United States of tariffs, sanctions or other restrictions on goods imported from outside of the United States or countermeasures imposed in response to such government actions could adversely affect our operations or our ability to sell our products globally, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In 2018, the President of the United States signed an order to impose a tariff on imports from certain countries, including China. The materials subject to these tariffs may impact the cost of raw materials used by our suppliers or in our customers\u2019 products. The imposition of further tariffs by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken in response to additional tariffs, could increase costs in our supply chain or reduce demand of our customers\u2019 products, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur customers or suppliers could also become subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny or export restrictions. For example, the United States Department of Commerce imposed sanctions on one of our customers in China in 2018, which prevented us from doing business with them until the sanctions were lifted. The U.S. Justice Department filed criminal charges against another of our customers in China and has otherwise taken a negative tone to perceived business practices by this customer and others in China. Revenue from distributors and end customers in China represented approximately 51% of our total revenue in 2018. Future sanctions similar to those imposed in the past could adversely affect our ability to earn revenue from these and similar customers. We cannot predict what impact these and future actions, sanctions or criminal charges could have on our customers or suppliers, and therefore our business. If any of our other customers or suppliers become subject to sanctions or other regulatory scrutiny, or if our customers are affected by tariffs or other government trade restrictions, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe compete against companies that have significantly greater resources than us and numerous other product solutions.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, manufacturing, marketing, and sales resources. Consolidation in our industry may increasingly mean that our competitors have greater consolidated resources, or other synergies, that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. We currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products, as well as numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative solutions, such as applications processor, application specific standard product, microcontroller, analog, and digital signal processing technologies. Competition from these semiconductor companies may intensify as we offer more products in any of our end markets. These competitors include established, multinational semiconductor companies, as well as emerging companies.\nThe intellectual property licensing component of our business strategy increases our business risk and fluctuation of our revenue and margins.\nOur business strategy includes licensing our intellectual property to companies that incorporate it into their technologies that address multiple markets, including markets where we participate and compete. Our Licensing and services revenue may be impacted by the introduction of new technologies by customers in place of the technologies we license, changes in the law that may weaken our ability to prevent the use of our patented technology by others, the expiration of our patents, and changes of demand or selling prices for products using licensed patents. We cannot assure that our licensing customers will continue to license our technology on commercially favorable terms or at all, or that these customers will introduce and sell products incorporating our technology, accurately report royalties owed to us, pay agreed upon royalties, honor agreed upon market restrictions, or maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or will not infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property. Our intellectual property licensing agreements are complex and may depend upon many factors that require significant judgments, including completion of milestones, allocation of values to delivered items and customer acceptance.\nOur sale of patents and intermittent significant licensing transactions can cause material fluctuations in our revenue and gross margins.\nWe have generated revenue from the sale of certain patents from our portfolio, generally for non-core technology that we are no longer actively developing. While we plan to continue to monetize our patent portfolio through sales of non-core patents, we may not be able to realize adequate interest or prices for those patents. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to generate revenue from these sales. In addition, although we seek to be strategic in our decisions to sell patents, we might incur reputational harm if a purchaser of our patents sues one of our customers for infringement of the purchased patent, and we might later decide to enter a space that requires the use of one or more of the patents we sold. In addition, as we sell groups of patents, we no longer have the opportunity to further sell or to license those patents and receive a continuing royalty stream.\nOur Licensing and services revenue fluctuates, sometimes significantly, from period to period because it is heavily dependent on a few key transactions being completed in a given period, the timing of which is difficult to predict and may not match our expectations. Because of its high margin, the Licensing and services revenue portion of our overall revenue can have a disproportionate impact on gross profit and profitability. In addition, generating revenue from patent sales and intellectual property licenses is a lengthy and complex process that may last beyond the period in which our efforts begin, and the accounting rules governing the recognition of revenue from patent sales and intellectual property licensing transactions are increasingly complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, the amount of license revenue recognized in any period may differ significantly from our expectations.\nOur products are used across different end markets, and a downturn in any of these end markets could cause a meaningful reduction in demand for our products.\nOur products are used across different end markets, and demand for our products is difficult to predict and may vary within or among our Industrial and Automotive, Communications and Computing, and Mobile and Consumer end markets. Our target markets may not grow or develop as we currently expect, and demand may increase or change in one or more of our end markets, and changes in demand may reduce our revenue, lower our gross margin and effect our operating results. We have experienced concentrations of revenue at certain customers and within certain end markets, and we regularly compete for design opportunities at these customers and within these markets. Any deterioration in these end markets, reductions in the magnitude of revenue streams, our inability to meet design and pricing requirements, or volatility in demand for our products could lead to a reduction in our revenue and adversely affect our operating results. Our success in our end markets depends on many factors, including the strength or financial performance of the companies in our end markets, our ability to timely meet rapidly changing product requirements, market needs, and our ability to maintain design wins across different markets and customers to dampen the effects of market volatility. Our inability to accomplish any of the foregoing, or to offset the volatility of the end markets through diversification into other markets, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur margins are dependent on our achieving continued yield improvement.\nWe rely on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining acceptable margins. To the extent such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or that our products do not achieve market acceptance or market acceptance at acceptable pricing, our forecasts of future revenue, financial condition, and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nShortages in, or increased costs of, wafers and materials could adversely impact our gross margins and lead to reduced revenues.\nWorldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is relatively inelastic. If the demand for silicon wafers or assembly material exceeds market supply, our supply of silicon wafers or assembly material could quickly become limited or prohibitively expensive. We typically have short-term wafer supply agreements that do not ensure long-term supply or allocation commitments. A shortage in manufacturing capacity could hinder our ability to meet product demand and therefore reduce our revenue. In addition, silicon wafers constitute a material portion of our product cost. If we are unable to purchase wafers at favorable prices, our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe nature of our business and length of our sales cycle makes our revenue, gross margin and net income subject to fluctuation and difficult to accurately predict.\nA number of factors, including how products are manufactured to support end markets, yield, wafer pricing, cost of packaging raw materials, product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing dynamics, product quality, geographic and/or end market mix, and pricing strategies, can cause our revenue, gross margins and net income to fluctuate significantly either positively or negatively from period to period.\nWe have limited visibility into the demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon our products being designed into our end customers' products and those products achieving market acceptance. During our sales cycle, our customers typically test and evaluate our products prior to deciding to include our products into the design of their own products, and then require additional time to begin volume production of their products. This lengthy sales cycle may cause us to incur significant expenses, experience significant production delays and to incur additional inventory costs before we receive a customer order that may be delayed or never get placed. A key strategic customer may demand certain design or production resources to meet their requirements or work on a specific solution, which could cause delays in our normal development schedule and result in significant investment of our resources or missed opportunities with other potential customers. We may incur these expenses without generating revenue from our products to offset the expenses.\nWhile our sales cycles are typically long, our average product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate. Our inventory levels may be higher than historical norms, from time to time, due to inventory build decisions aimed at meeting expected demand from a single large customer, reducing direct material cost or enabling responsiveness to expected demand. In the event the expected demand does not materialize, or if our short sales cycle does not generate sufficient revenue, we may be subject to incremental excess and obsolescence costs.\nThese factors make it difficult for us to accurately forecast future sales and project quarterly revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales weakens our ability to project our inventory requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write-downs or failure to meet customer product demands in a timely manner. While we may give guidance, the difficulty in forecasting revenues as well as the relative customer and product mix of those revenues limits our ability to provide accurate forward-looking revenue and gross margin guidance.\nWe may experience a disruption of our business activities due to changes in our executive leadership team and the resulting management transitions.\nWe have recently experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team. In August 2018, the Company's Board of Directors announced the appointment of Jim Anderson as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, whose employment commenced September 4, 2018. From September 2018 to January 2019, the Company also announced new appointments to executive leadership roles in finance, research and development, marketing, sales and operations. This executive leadership transition may result in loss of personnel with deep institutional knowledge and has the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with employees, customers and suppliers. We must successfully integrate our new management team members within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and these management transitions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as our new executive leadership team becomes familiar with our business. In addition, our competitors may seek to use this transition and the related potential disruptions to gain a competitive advantage over us. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel and in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel. If we are unable to mitigate these or other similar risks, our business activity could be disrupted, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAcquisitions, divestitures, strategic investments and strategic partnerships could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may pursue growth opportunities by acquiring complementary businesses, solutions or technologies through strategic transactions, investments or partnerships. The identification of suitable acquisition, strategic investment or strategic partnership candidates can be costly and time consuming and can distract our management team from our current operations. If such strategic transactions require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all, and such transaction may adversely affect our liquidity and capital structure. We may also choose to divest certain non-core assets, which divestitures could lead to charges against earnings and may expose us to additional liabilities and risks. Any strategic transaction might not strengthen our competitive position, may increase some of our risks, and may be viewed negatively by our customers, partners or investors. Even if we successfully complete a strategic transaction, we may not be able to effectively integrate the acquired business, technology, systems, control environment, solutions, personnel or operations into our business or global tax structure. We may experience unexpected changes in how we are required to account for strategic transactions pursuant to U.S. GAAP and may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any strategic transaction. We may incur unexpected costs, claims or liabilities that we incur during the strategic transaction or that we assume from the acquired company, or we may discover adverse conditions post acquisition for which we have limited or no recourse.\nWe regularly test for goodwill and other impairments as required under U.S. GAAP, and we may incur future impairments.\nWe are required under U.S. GAAP to test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and to test goodwill and long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment at any other time that circumstances arise indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company currently operates as one reporting unit: the core Lattice (\"Core\") business, which includes intellectual property and semiconductor devices. Impairment charges related to amortizable intangible assets from the Silicon Image acquisition totaled approximately $12.5 million, $32.4 million, and $7.9 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. There is no assurance that future impairment tests will indicate that goodwill or amortizable intangible assets will be deemed recoverable. As we continue to review our business operations and test for impairment or in connection with possible sales of assets, we may have impairment charges in the future, which may be material.\nWe depend on independent contractors to provide key functions in our product development and operations, and any disruption of their services, or an increased in cost of these services, could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on subcontractors to provide cost effective and efficient services in our product development and supply chain functions, including test and assembly services, software and hardware development, support of intellectual property cores, inventory management, order fulfillment and direct sales logistics.\nOur operations and operating results may be adversely affected if we experience problems with our subcontractors that impact the delivery of product to our customers. These problems may include: delays in software or hardware development timelines, prolonged inability to obtain wafers or packaging materials with competitive performance and cost attributes; inability to achieve adequate yields or timely delivery; inability to meet customer timelines or demands, disruption or defects in assembly, test, or shipping services; or delays in stabilizing manufacturing processes or ramping up volume for new products. If our third-party supply chain providers were to reduce or discontinue services for us or their operations are disrupted as a result of a fire, earthquake, act of terrorism, political unrest, governmental uncertainty, war, disease, or other natural disaster or catastrophic event, weak economic conditions, or any other reason, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLitigation and unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nFrom time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Certain claims may not yet be resolved, including but not limited to any that are discussed under Item 3. Legal Proceedings and \"Note 19 - Contingencies\" contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit or outcome, claims or litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid these risks. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters or enter into a material settlement, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results and certain portions of our business.\nChanges to financial accounting standards may affect our results of operations and could cause us to change our business practices.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements to conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting rules and regulations. Changes in these rules, such as the adoption of ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers in fiscal 2018 or ASC 842 - Leases in fiscal 2019, or in the guidance relating to interpretation and adoption of the rules could have a significant effect on our financial results and could affect portions of our business differently.\nAccounting requirements related to sales through our distribution channel could result in our reporting revenue in excess of demand.\nNew revenue standards require recognition of revenue based on estimates and may require us to book revenue from distributors that is in excess of actual end customer demand. Since we have limited ability to forecast inventory levels of our end customers, we depend on the timeliness and accuracy of resale reports from our distributors. Late or inaccurate resale reports could mask significant build-up of inventories in our distribution channel, have a detrimental effect on our ability to properly recognize revenue, and impact our ability to forecast future sales. An inventory build-up in our distribution channel could result in a slowdown in orders, requests for returns from customers, or requests to move out planned shipments. If our distributors do not ultimately sell the inventory and our estimates change, we could be required to materially correct our recognized revenue in a future period, depending on actual results. Any failure to manage these challenges could disrupt or reduce sales of our products and unfavorably impact our financial results.\nOur participation in the HDMI standard is evolving. We no longer act as agent for the HDMI standard and accordingly, our share of adopter fees for the HDMI standard is declining and may further decline.\nWe acted as agent of the HDMI consortium until December 31, 2016 and were responsible for promoting and administering the specification. We received all of the adopter fees paid by adopters of the HDMI specification in connection with our role as agent. In September 2016, the Founders of the HDMI consortium, of which we are a member, amended the Founders Agreement resulting in changes to our role as agent for the HDMI consortium and to the model for sharing adopter fee revenues. Under the terms of the agreement, our role as the agent was terminated effective January 1, 2017 and a new independent entity was appointed to act as the new HDMI licensing agent with responsibility for licensing and the distribution of royalties among Founders. As a result of the amended model for sharing adopter fee revenue, we will be entitled to a reduced share of adopter fees paid by parties adopting the HDMI standard.\nWe share HDMI royalties with the other HDMI Founders based on an allocation formula, which is reviewed every three years. Our portion of the royalty allocation has declined for the last several years. In 2015, we received between 24% and 25% of the royalty allocation, while for 2016 and 2017, we received 20% of the royalty allocation. The royalty allocation for 2018 and future years is not yet known but may decline. If the royalty allocation continues to decline, our financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, delays in the signing of new royalty sharing agreements impacted our timing of revenue recognition and ability to recognize revenue related to the royalties in fiscal 2017. With our adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), we will recognize revenue related to royalties based on estimates of the amounts we will be entitled to receive, and these estimates could differ materiality from actual royalty sharing amounts.\nChanges in effective tax rates, tax laws and our global organizational structure and operations could expose us to unanticipated tax consequences.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, Singapore, and other countries. We have a global tax structure that aligns our corporate structure with our global business operations, and we currently operate legal entities in multiple countries. In some countries, we maintain multiple entities for tax or other purposes. We may choose to consolidate or integrate certain of these entities, and these integration activities, changes in tax laws, rates, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of the Company, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe make no assurance as to what taxes we pay or the ability to estimate our future effective tax rate because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. In particular, we anticipate that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted December 22, 2017, will impact us. While we are able to quantify or estimate the effects of some of the provisions now in the act, we do not know of all of the rules the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") will enact to fully implement the tax law changes, or the IRS\u2019 interpretations of the changes. We also continue to analyze and understand the changes and the impacts on us, including the indirect impacts that result from how our industry or we might modify behaviors in a response to the new tax law structure. We also provide no assurance that estimates we provide to quantify the effect of the changes may be accurate.\nWe may be subject to warranty claims and other costs related to our products.\nIn general, we warrant our products for varying lengths of time against non-conformance to our specifications and certain other defects. Because our products, including hardware, software, and intellectual property cores, are highly complex and increasingly incorporate advanced technology, our quality assurance programs may not detect all defects, whether manufacturing defects in individual products or systematic defects that could affect numerous shipments. Inability to detect a defect could result in a diversion of our engineering resources from product development efforts, increased engineering expenses to remediate the defect, and increased costs due to customer accommodation or inventory impairment charges. On occasion, we have also repaired or replaced certain components, made software fixes, or refunded the purchase price or license fee paid by our customers due to product or software defects. Our insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect against these issues. If there are significant product defects, the costs to remediate such defects, net of reimbursed amounts from our vendors, if any, or to resolve warranty claims may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may harm our reputation.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our new and existing intellectual property rights, our financial results and our ability to compete effectively may suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our proprietary technology and we rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. We intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology, however, we may be unsuccessful in asserting our intellectual property rights or such rights may be invalidated, violated, circumvented, or challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted against us patent, copyright, and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. Third parties may attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property through electronic or other means or assert infringement claims against us in the future. Such assertions by third parties may result in costly litigation, indemnity claims, or other legal actions, and we may not prevail in such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms. This could result in the loss of our ability to import and sell our products or require us to pay costly royalties to third parties in connection with sales of our products. Any infringement claim, indemnification claim, or impairment or loss of use of our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWeakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2017, we disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to our risk assessment involving significant unusual transactions. Our management team has developed remediation steps to address such material weakness. Although this material weakness was eliminated by our remediation steps, we may identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nA material change in the agreements governing encryption keys we use could place additional restrictions on us, or our distributors or contract manufacturers, which could restrict product shipment or significantly increase the cost to track products throughout the distribution chain.\nCertain components in our products contain encryption keys used in connection with High Definition Content Protection (\"HDCP\"). The regulation and distribution of these encryption keys are controlled through license agreements with Digital Content Protection (\"DCP\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel Corporation. These license agreements have been modified by DCP from time to time, and such changes could impact us, our distributors, and our customers. An important element of HDMI is the ability to implement link protection for high definition (\"HD\"), and more recently, 4K UltraHD, content. We implement various aspects of the HDCP link protection within certain parts we sell. We also, for the benefit of our customers, include the necessary HDCP encryption keys in parts we ship to customers. These encryption keys are provided to us from DCP. We have a specific process for tracking and handling these encryption keys. If DCP changes any of the tracking or handling requirements associated with HDCP encryption keys, we may be required to change our manufacturing and distribution processes, which could adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution costs associated with these products. If we cannot satisfy new requirements for the handling and tracking of encryption keys, we may have to cease shipping or manufacturing certain products.\nWe may have failed to adequately insure against certain risks, and, as a result, our financial condition and results may be adversely affected.\nWe carry insurance customary for companies in our industry, including, but not limited to, liability, property, and casualty; workers' compensation; and business interruption insurance. We also insure our employees for basic medical expenses. In addition, we have insurance contracts that provide director and officer liability coverage for our directors and officers. Other than the specific areas mentioned above, we are self-insured with respect to most other risks and exposures, and the insurance we carry in many cases is subject to a significant policy deductible or other limitation before coverage applies. Based on management's assessment and judgment, we have determined that it is more cost effective to self-insure against certain risks than to incur the insurance premium costs. The risks and exposures for which we self-insure include, but are not limited to, certain natural disasters, certain product defects, certain matters for which we indemnify third parties, political risk, certain theft, patent infringement, and employment practice matters. Should there be a catastrophic loss due to an uninsured event (such as an earthquake) or a loss due to adverse occurrences in any area in which we are self-insured, our financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to attract, such personnel could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.\nWe depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and other technical personnel. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain such personnel and attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers who can respond to market demands and required product innovation. Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing qualified personnel. Additionally, from time to time we have effected restructurings which have eliminated a number of positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and our ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future. If we lose existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, we could have difficulty competing in our highly-competitive and innovative environment.", "PERMNO": 75854, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "LSCC"}
