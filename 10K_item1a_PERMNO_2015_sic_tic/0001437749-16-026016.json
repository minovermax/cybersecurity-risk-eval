Risk Factors\nOur business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks, and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant, and you should take these risks into account in evaluating us or any investment decision involving us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently believe to be less significant may also adversely affect us.\nRisks Relating To Our Industry\nWe face intense competition within our industry and our revenue may decrease if we are not able to respond to this competition effectively.\nCustomers in the uniform and corporate identity apparel industry choose suppliers primarily based upon the quality, price and breadth of products offered. We encounter competition from a number of companies in the geographic areas we serve. Major competitors for our Uniforms and Related Products segment include publicly held companies such as Cintas Corporation, Unifirst Corporation and G&K Services, as well as ARAMARK - a division of ARAMARK Corporation. We also compete with a multitude of regional and local competitors that vary by market. If our existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, we may be required to lower our prices, which would adversely affect our operating results. Similarly, if customers or potential customers perceive the products offered by our existing or future competitors to be of higher quality than ours or part of a broader product mix, our revenues may decline, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our competitors generally compete with us for acquisition candidates, which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of acquisition candidates available to us.\nRegional or national economic slowdowns, high unemployment levels, or cost increases might have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur primary products are provided to workers employed by our customers and, as a result, our business prospects are dependent upon levels of employment and overall economic conditions, among other factors. Our revenues are impacted by our customers\u2019 opening and closing of locations and reductions and increases in headcount. For example, between 2009 and 2013, voluntary employee turnover declined significantly because fewer alternative jobs were available to employees of our customers. As a result, uniform orders on a per-employee basis decreased among many of our customers.\nIf we are unable to offset these effects through the addition of new customers (through acquisition or otherwise), the penetration of existing customers with a broader mix of product and service offerings, or decreased production costs that can be passed on in the form of lower prices, our revenue growth rates will be negatively impacted. Events or conditions in a particular geographic area, such as adverse weather and other factors, could also hurt our operating results. While we do not believe that our exposure is greater than that of our competitors, we could be adversely affected by increases in the prices of fabric, natural gas, gasoline, wages, employee benefits, insurance costs and other components of product cost unless we can recover such increases through proportional increases in the prices for our products and services. Competitive and general economic conditions might limit our ability and that of our competitors to increase prices to cover such increases in our product cost.\nVolatility in the global financial markets could adversely affect results.\nIn the past, global financial markets have experienced extreme disruption, including, among other things, volatility in security prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. In addition, global equity markets have been highly volatile this year. There can be no assurance that there will not be further change or volatility, which could lead to challenges in our business and negatively impact our financial results. The tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders and spending for our products and services. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of any disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects they may have on our business and financial condition.\nThe uniform and corporate identity apparel industry is subject to pricing pressures that may cause us to lower the prices we charge for our products and adversely affect our financial performance.\nMany of our competitors source their product requirements from developing countries to achieve a lower cost operating environment, possibly with lower costs than our offshore facilities, and those manufacturers may use these cost savings to reduce prices. To remain competitive, we must adjust our prices from time to time in response to these industry-wide pricing pressures. Moreover, increased customer demands for allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support could reduce our gross margins and affect our profitability. Our financial performance may be negatively affected by these pricing pressures if we are forced to reduce our prices and we cannot reduce our product costs proportionally or if our product costs increase and we cannot increase our prices proportionately.\nIncreases in the price of finished goods and raw materials used to manufacture our products could materially increase our costs and decrease our profitability.\nThe principal fabrics used in our business are made from cotton, wool, silk, synthetic and cotton-synthetic blends. The prices we pay for these fabrics and our finished goods are dependent on the market price for the raw materials used to produce them, primarily cotton and chemical components of synthetic fabrics including raw materials such as chemicals and dyestuffs. These finished goods and raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate, currency exchange rates, labor costs, and other unpredictable factors. Fluctuations in petroleum prices also may influence the prices of related items such as chemicals, dyestuffs and polyester yarn.\nFor example, during the latter part of 2010, cotton prices began increasing dramatically and reached historically high levels during 2011 due to weather-related and other supply disruptions, which when combined with robust global demand, particularly in Asia, created concerns about availability and increased costs for our products. While were able to pass on a portion of these price increases to our customers during most of 2011, we saw a negative impact on our gross margins from the fourth quarter of 2011 through 2012.\nAny increase in raw material prices increases our cost of sales and can decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass the costs on to our customers in the form of higher prices. In addition, if one or more of our competitors is able to reduce their production costs by taking advantage of any reductions in raw material prices or favorable sourcing agreements, we may face pricing pressures from those competitors and may be forced to reduce our prices or face a decline in net sales, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanging international trade regulation on imports of textiles and apparel may increase competition in our industry. Future quotas, duties or tariffs may increase our costs or limit the amount of products that we can import.\nOur operations are subject to various international trade agreements and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, as supplemented (NAFTA), Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act, as amended (HOPE), and African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Generally, these trade agreements benefit our business by reducing or eliminating the duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country. However, trade agreements can also impose requirements that negatively affect our business, such as limiting the countries from which we can purchase raw materials and setting quotas on products that may be imported into the United States from a particular country. In addition, increased competition from developing countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe countries in which our products are manufactured or into which they are imported may from time to time impose new quotas, duties, tariffs and requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, additional workplace regulations, or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Adverse changes in these costs and restrictions could harm our business. We cannot assure you that future trade agreements will not provide our competitors an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe corporate identity apparel and uniform industry is subject to changing fashion trends and if we misjudge consumer preferences, the image of one or more of our brands may suffer and the demand for our products may decrease.\nThe apparel industry, including uniforms and corporate identity apparel, is subject to shifting customer demands and evolving fashion trends and our success is also dependent upon our ability to anticipate and promptly respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate, identify or promptly react to changing trends or styles may result in decreased demand for our products, as well as excess inventories and markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, if we misjudge consumer preferences, our brand image may be impaired. We believe our products are, however, in general, less subject to fashion trends compared to many other apparel manufacturers because we manufacture and sell uniforms, corporate identity apparel and other accessories.\nRisks Relating To Our Business\nOur success depends upon the continued protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights and we may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain, defend, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nOur owned intellectual property and certain of our licensed intellectual property have significant value and are instrumental to our ability to market our products. While we own and use several trademarks, our \u201cFashion Seal Healthcare\u201d mark is critically important to our business, as more than 25% of our products are sold under that name. We cannot assure you that our owned or licensed intellectual property or the operation of our business does not infringe on or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. We cannot assure you that third parties will not assert claims against us on any such bases or that we will be able to successfully resolve such claims. In addition, although we seek international protection of our intellectual property, the laws of some foreign countries may not allow us to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We could also incur substantial costs to defend legal actions relating to use of our intellectual property or prosecute legal actions against others using our intellectual property, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. There also can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate and conclude extensions of existing license agreements on similar economic terms or at all.\nOur customers may cancel or decrease the quantity of their orders, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nAlthough we have long-standing customer relationships, we do not have long-term contracts with many of our customers. Sales to many of our customers are on an order-by-order basis. If we cannot fill customers\u2019 orders on time, orders may be cancelled and relationships with customers may suffer, which could have an adverse effect on us, especially if the relationship is with a major customer. Furthermore, if any of our customers experience a significant downturn in their business, or fail to remain committed to our programs or brands, the customer may reduce or discontinue purchases from us. The reduction in the amount of our products purchased by customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, some of our customers have experienced significant changes and difficulties, including consolidation of ownership, increased centralization of buying decisions, restructurings, bankruptcies and liquidations. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer\u2019s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer\u2019s receivables or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous purchases by that customer, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe have significant pension obligations with respect to our employees and our available cash flow may be adversely affected in the event that payments become due under any pension plans that are unfunded or underfunded.\nA portion of our active and retired employees participate in defined benefit pension plans under which we are obligated to provide prescribed levels of benefits regardless of the value of the underlying assets, if any, of the applicable pension plan. If our obligations under a plan are unfunded or underfunded, we will have to use cash flow from operations and other sources to pay our obligations either as they become due or over some shorter funding period. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $8.9 million in unfunded or underfunded obligations related to our pension plans, compared to $8.1 million as of December 31, 2014.\nWe may undertake acquisitions to expand our business, which may pose risks to our business.\nWe selectively pursue acquisitions from time to time as part of our growth strategy. We compete with others within our industry for suitable acquisition candidates. This competition may increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of acquisition candidates available to us. As a result, acquisition candidates may not be available to us in the future on favorable terms. Even if we are able to acquire businesses on favorable terms, managing growth through acquisition is a difficult process that includes integration and training of personnel, combining plant and operating procedures, and additional matters related to the integration of acquired businesses within our existing organization. Unanticipated issues related to integration may result in additional expense or in disruption to our operations, either of which could negatively impact our ability to achieve anticipated benefits. While we believe we will be able to fully integrate acquired businesses, we can give no assurance that we will be successful in this regard.\nWe are subject to international, federal, state and local laws and regulations and failure to comply with them may expose us to potential liability.\nWe are subject to international, federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission and various labor, workplace and related laws, as well as environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws may expose us to potential liability and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nShortages of supply of sourced goods from suppliers, interruptions in our manufacturing, and local conditions in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe utilize multiple supply sources and manufacturing facilities. However, an unexpected interruption in any of the sources or facilities could temporarily adversely affect our results of operations until alternate sources or facilities can be secured. In 2015 and 2014 approximately 22% and 22%, respectively, of our products were obtained from suppliers located in Central America. If we are unable to continue to obtain our products from Central America, it could significantly disrupt our business. Because we source products and maintain operations in Central America, we are affected by conditions in Central America, including increased duties, possible employee turnover, labor and other unrest and lack of developed infrastructure.\nOur business may be impacted by adverse weather.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in Florida, which is a hurricane-sensitive area. Should a hurricane occur, the possibly resulting infrastructure damage and disruption to the area could negatively affect Superior, such as by damage to, or total destruction of, our headquarters and surrounding transportation infrastructure. In addition, similar disruptions to the business of our customers located in areas affected by hurricanes may adversely impact sales of our products.\nOur Remote Staffing Solutions business is dependent on the trend toward outsourcing.\nOur business and growth depend in large part on the industry trend toward outsourced customer contact management services. Outsourcing means that an entity contracts with a third party, such as us, to provide customer contact services rather than perform such services in-house. There can be no assurance that this trend will continue, as organizations may elect to perform such services themselves. A significant change in this trend could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInability to attract and retain key management or other personnel could adversely impact our business.\nOur success is dependent on the skills, experience, and efforts of our senior management and other key personnel. If, for any reason, one or more senior executive or key personnel was not to remain active in our company, or if we were unable to attract and retain senior management or key personnel, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCertain existing shareholders have significant control.\nAt December 31, 2015, our executive officers and certain of their family members collectively owned 33.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our executive officers and certain of their family members have significant influence over the election of our Board of Directors, the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring shareholder approval, and the affairs and policies of our company.", "PERMNO": 47861, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "SGC"}
