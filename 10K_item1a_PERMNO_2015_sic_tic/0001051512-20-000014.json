Risk Factors\nPRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nSAFE HARBOR CAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including exhibits, contains statements that are not based on historical facts and represent forward-looking statements, as this term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that TDS intends, expects, projects, believes, estimates, plans or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cprojects\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying them. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, events or developments to be significantly different from any future results, events or developments expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include those set forth below under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Each of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations. However, such factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this document. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements. TDS undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K to understand the material risks relating to TDS\u2019 business.\nRisk Factors\n1)\nIntense competition in the markets in which TDS operates could adversely affect TDS\u2019 revenues or increase its costs to compete.\nCompetition in the wireless industry is intense and is expected to intensify in the future due to multiple factors such as increasing market penetration, introduction of new products, new competitors and changing prices. There is competition in service plan pricing; handsets and other devices; network quality, coverage, speed and technologies, including 5G technology; distribution; new entrants; bundled services and products, such as content; and other categories. In particular, wireless competition includes aggressive service plan and device pricing, including pricing for unlimited plans, which could result in switching activity and churn. In addition, competition based on network speed may increase as customer demand for higher speeds increases. TDS\u2019 ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the telecommunications industry. In addition, unlimited plans and other data pricing constructs across the industry may limit TDS\u2019 ability to monetize future growth in data usage. TDS anticipates that these competitive factors may cause the prices for services and products to decline and the costs to compete to increase.\nTDS\u2019 primary competitors are national or global telecommunications companies that are larger than TDS, possess greater financial and other resources, possess more extensive coverage areas and more spectrum within their coverage areas, and market other services with their communications services that TDS does not offer. TDS' competitors are actively marketing their deployment of 5G and, as a result, are raising consumer awareness of the technology. If TDS cannot keep pace with its competitors in deploying 5G or other comparable offerings, or if TDS' deployment of 5G technology does not result in significant incremental revenues, TDS' financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business could be adversely affected. Further, other companies that currently are less competitive may also add more efficient low-band spectrum to become more competitive in TDS\u2019 primary markets. In particular, to the extent that existing competitors or new entrants acquire low-band (e.g., 600 MHz) spectrum or deploy newer wireless technologies in TDS markets, TDS could face increased competition over time. In addition, TDS may face competition from technologies that may be introduced in the future. New technologies, services and products that are more commercially effective than the technologies, services and products offered by TDS may be developed. Further, new technologies may be proprietary such that TDS is not able to adopt such technologies. There can be no assurance that TDS will be able to compete successfully in this environment.\nSources of competition to TDS\u2019 wireless business typically include two to five competing wireless telecommunications service providers in each market, wireline telecommunications service providers, cable companies, resellers (including MVNOs), and providers of other alternate telecommunications services. Many of TDS\u2019 wireless competitors and other competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources than TDS.\nSources of competition to TDS\u2019 Wireline business include, but are not limited to, resellers of local exchange services, interexchange carriers, RBOCs, direct broadcast satellite providers, wireless communications providers, cable companies, access providers, CLECs, fiber overbuilders, VoIP providers and providers using other emerging technologies. The Wireline CLEC and out-of-territory business sources of competition include the sources identified above as well as the ILEC in each market, which enjoys competitive advantages, including its wireline connection to virtually all of the customers and potential customers of Wireline\u2019s CLEC business, its established brand name and its substantial financial resources. Wireline\u2019s CLEC business is typically required to discount services to win potential customers. Further, this business may be negatively impacted if it cannot provide levels of bandwidth prospective customers demand due in large part to lack of availability of IP-based wholesale services at competitive prices. In the future, TDS expects the number of its physical access lines served to continue to be adversely affected by wireless voice and broadband substitution, by cable company competition, and potentially by fiber overbuilders.\nSome of the specific risks presented by certain Wireline competitors include:\n\u25aa\nCable companies - continued deployment of broadband technologies such as DOCSIS 3.0 and 3.1 and their further evolution that substantially increase broadband speeds, and offering these speeds to customers at relatively low prices, including speed upgrades for no additional charge, competition for video services, and bundling of wireless services.\n\u25aa\nWireless - the trend of customers \u201csubstituting\u201d their wireline voice and broadband connections with a wireless device and wireless voice and broadband services continues.\n\u25aa\nRBOCs - continue to be formidable competitors given their full suite of services, experience and strong financial resources.\n\u25aa\nVoIP providers - are able to offer voice service at a very low price point.\n\u25aa\nFiber overbuilders - municipalities, neighboring ILECs, or other providers offering the same or higher data speeds at similar or lower price points.\n\u25aa\nOther providers - competition to IPTV and broadband from broadcast television, satellite providers and on-line video services.\nTDS\u2019 Cable business also provides broadband, video and voice services. Cable\u2019s business faces sources of competition similar to the Wireline business, but with some differences. In particular, Cable does not typically compete against another cable company for broadband services, but competes against fiber overbuilders and ILECs that primarily offer DSL-based services and may also offer fiber-based and other premium and enhanced data services. Cable provides VoIP services rather than traditional wireline voice connections and faces competition from other VoIP providers, but also faces competition from ILECs providing traditional wireline voice connections. With respect to video, Cable also competes against broadcast television, direct broadcast satellite providers, on-line video services, and wireline providers which have begun to upgrade their networks to provide video services in addition to voice and high-speed internet access services.\nSources of competition for HMS\u2019 business primarily include large technology companies, as well as smaller independent firms that focus on mid-market companies. In addition, new entrants may emerge and grow rapidly creating additional sources of competition or companies may choose to insource their IT services. The IT services market is large and complex, with a diverse array of segments in which performance and market dynamics vary considerably. As a result of these dynamics the IT services market is a highly competitive environment. Due to the competitive environment, in order to win new customer engagements, HMS may be required to assume greater potential contractual risk obligations, such as risks relating to the consequences of data breaches or unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information. In the event of such incidents, the HMS business could be materially adversely affected.\nIf TDS does not adapt to compete effectively in such a highly competitive environment, such competitive factors could result in product, service, pricing or cost disadvantages and could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n2)\nA failure by TDS to successfully execute its business strategy (including planned acquisitions, spectrum acquisitions, fiber builds, divestitures and exchanges) or allocate resources or capital effectively could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe successful execution of business strategies, the optimal allocation within TDS\u2019 portfolio of assets and optimal capital allocation decisions depend on various factors, many of which are not in TDS\u2019 control. TDS\u2019 ability to achieve projected financial results by implementing and executing its business strategies and optimally allocating its assets and capital could be affected by such factors. Such factors include but are not limited to pricing practices by competitors, relative scale, purchasing power, roaming and other strategic agreements, wireless device availability, timing of introduction of wireless devices, access to spectrum, emerging technologies, programming and retransmission costs, mid-market demand for cloud and hosted services, changes in tax or import tariff regulations and other factors. In addition, there is no assurance that U.S. Cellular\u2019s, TDS Telecom\u2019s or HMS' strategies will be successful. Even if TDS executes its business strategies as intended, such strategies may not be successful in the long term at achieving growth in customers, revenues, net income, or generating portfolio returns greater than TDS\u2019 cost of capital. In addition, if at some point a change in asset allocation is desired, TDS may be unable to alter asset allocation to meet growth and return goals in a timely and efficient manner. In such case, there would be an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations. TDS\u2019 current forecast indicates that TDS will not achieve a return on capital that exceeds its cost of capital in the foreseeable future. See Item 1. Business for additional information on TDS\u2019 business strategy.\nU.S. Cellular is a regional wireless carrier, but competes primarily against much larger national wireless carriers with much greater resources. Its business strategy in attempting to attract and retain wireless customers through a value proposition comprised of a high-quality network, outstanding customer service, and competitive devices, plans and pricing, all provided with a local focus has not resulted in, and in the future may not result in, performance that achieves returns in line with or above its cost of capital. U.S. Cellular\u2019s current forecast indicates that U.S. Cellular will not achieve a return on capital that exceeds its cost of capital in the foreseeable future. U.S. Cellular also might be unable to adopt technologies, services and products as fast as its larger competitors. As a result, consumers who are eager to adopt new technologies, services and products more quickly may select U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors rather than U.S. Cellular as their service provider. To the extent that U.S. Cellular does not attract or retain these types of customers, U.S. Cellular could be at a competitive disadvantage and have a customer base that generates lower profit margins relative to its competition.\nWireline and Cable each provide broadband, video and voice services and, as a result, have certain risks in common, but also have certain risks that are specific to that segment. Both Wireline and Cable strive to offer the most competitive broadband connection in its markets in order to capitalize on data growth and the customers\u2019 need for higher broadband speeds. Wireline\u2019s DSL-based services have several limitations compared to DOCSIS technologies employed by cable companies. Where it is cost-effective, Wireline is deploying fiber technology which offers advantages over cable to provide broadband. Wireline is also faced with other significant challenges, including customer connection and access minute declines in traditional wireline voice services as well as decreases in intercarrier compensation received for the use of its networks. Wireline must continually adjust its cost structure as a result of these challenges. A failure to develop and maintain an efficient cost structure would have an adverse effect on the Wireline and Cable businesses. The inability to execute timely on its fiber deployments could have an adverse effect on Wireline\u2019s business. In addition, failure to deploy plant upgrades and new technology could result in opportunities for overbuilders to move into Wireline and Cable territories that are not upgraded and build similar or superior networks, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business. Wireline and Cable\u2019s current forecasts indicate that Wireline and Cable will not achieve returns on capital that exceed their costs of capital in the foreseeable future.\nWireline\u2019s IPTV product and Cable\u2019s video service have significant costs and risks relating to programming and retransmission. Such costs have been increasing and these costs may not be able to be fully passed on to customers. In addition, both businesses are limited in their ability to obtain programming at favorable costs and terms due to their small scale. If Wireline or Cable fails to negotiate agreeable costs or terms with certain broadcast TV stations and cable networks, any resulting service interruptions could have an adverse effect on TDS' business. Further, changes in consumer behavior and/or new technologies are causing consumers to reduce or cancel their video services and instead seek to obtain video on demand over the internet or through new technologies. A wide range of regulatory or other issues also affect both businesses, including matters pertaining to set-top boxes, equipment connectivity, content regulation, closed captioning, pole attachments, privacy, copyright, technical standards, and municipal entry into video and broadband.\nAlthough Cable\u2019s business development strategy includes evaluating opportunities for possible further acquisitions of desirable cable companies on attractive terms to increase the scale of its business, there is no assurance that such acquisitions will be available, or that this strategy will be successful.\nHMS provides a wide range of IT services and has risks that are not shared with the other business segments. HMS\u2019 business strategy is to create, deliver and support a platform of IT products and services tailored for mid-sized business customers. HMS\u2019 current forecast indicates that it will not achieve a return on capital that exceeds its cost of capital in the foreseeable future. The HMS business is faced with a number of risks in its pursuit of its strategy, including: the rate of outsourcing IT needs and moving to the cloud by mid-sized business customers; the ability to sell recurring revenue services; the ability to attract new or retain existing customers; whether potential customers ascribe sufficient value to HMS\u2019 more customized cloud and hosted services compared to more commodity based offerings of larger competitors; HMS\u2019 limited scale when competing with larger competitors; and the impact of IT wage inflation.\nA failure by TDS to execute its business strategies successfully or to allocate resources or capital optimally could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\n3)\nUncertainty in TDS\u2019 future cash flow and liquidity or the inability to access capital, deterioration in the capital markets, other changes in TDS\u2019 performance or market conditions, changes in TDS\u2019 credit ratings or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to TDS, which could require TDS to reduce its construction, development or acquisition programs, reduce the amount of wireless spectrum licenses acquired, and/or reduce or cease share repurchases and/or the payment of dividends.\nTDS and its subsidiaries operate capital-intensive businesses. Historically, TDS has used internally-generated funds and also has obtained substantial funds from external sources for general corporate purposes. In the past, TDS\u2019 existing cash and investment balances, funds available under its revolving credit and receivables securitization agreements, funds from other financing sources, including term loans and other long-term debt, and cash flows from operating and certain investing and financing activities, including sales of assets or businesses, provided sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility for TDS to meet its normal day-to-day operating needs and debt service requirements, to finance the build-out and enhancement of markets and to fund acquisitions. There is no assurance that this will be the case in the future. It may be necessary from time to time to increase the amount of permissible borrowings under the existing revolving credit and receivables securitization agreements, to put in place new credit agreements, or to obtain other forms of financing in order to fund potential expenditures. TDS\u2019 liquidity would be adversely affected if, among other things, TDS is unable to obtain short or long-term financing on acceptable terms, TDS makes significant spectrum license purchases, TDS makes significant capital investments, TDS makes significant business acquisitions, the Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership (LA Partnership) discontinues or significantly reduces distributions compared to historical levels, or Federal USF and/or other regulatory support payments decline.\nTDS\u2019 credit rating currently is sub-investment grade. TDS has incurred negative free cash flow (defined as Cash flows from operating activities less Cash paid for additions to property, plant and equipment) at times in the past and this could occur in the future. TDS may require substantial additional capital for, among other uses, funding day-to-day operating needs including working capital, acquisitions of providers of cable, wireless or wireline telecommunications services, IT services or other businesses, spectrum license or system acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, the repurchase of shares, the payment of dividends, or making additional investments. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will continue to be available to TDS or its subsidiaries on terms or at prices acceptable to TDS. Insufficient cash flows from operating activities, changes in TDS' credit ratings, defaults of the terms of debt or credit agreements, uncertainty of access to capital, deterioration in the capital markets, reduced regulatory capital at banks which in turn limits their ability to borrow and lend, other changes in the performance of TDS or in market conditions or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to TDS, which could require TDS to reduce its acquisition, capital expenditure and business development programs, reduce the acquisition of wireless spectrum licenses, and/or reduce or cease share repurchases and/or the payment of dividends. TDS cannot provide assurance that circumstances that could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or capital resources will not occur. Any of the foregoing would have an adverse impact on TDS\u2019 businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\n4)\nTDS has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial performance and in turn adversely affect its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, comply with terms of debt covenants and incur additional debt.\nTDS has a significant amount of indebtedness and may need to incur additional indebtedness. TDS\u2019 level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it (i) may limit TDS\u2019 ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to its debt securities by rating organizations are revised downward; (ii) will require TDS to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on its debt, thereby reducing the funds available to TDS for other purposes including expansion through acquisitions, capital expenditures, marketing spending and expansion of its business; and (iii) may limit TDS\u2019 flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and make TDS more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions as compared to TDS\u2019 competitors. TDS\u2019 ability to make scheduled payments on its indebtedness or to refinance it will depend on its financial and operating performance which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and other factors beyond its control. In addition, TDS\u2019 leverage may put it at a competitive disadvantage to some of its competitors that are not as leveraged.\nThe TDS and U.S. Cellular revolving credit agreements, the TDS and U.S. Cellular term loan agreements and the U.S. Cellular receivables securitization agreement require TDS or U.S. Cellular, as applicable, to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial covenants. Depending on the actual financial performance of TDS and U.S. Cellular, there is a risk that TDS and/or U.S. Cellular could fail to satisfy the required financial covenants. If TDS or U.S. Cellular breach a financial or other covenant of any of these agreements, it would result in a default under that agreement, and could involve a cross-default under other debt instruments. This could in turn cause the affected lenders to accelerate the repayment of principal and accrued interest on any outstanding debt under such agreements and, if they choose, terminate the agreement. If appropriate, TDS and U.S. Cellular may request the applicable lenders for an amendment of financial covenants in the TDS and/or U.S. Cellular agreements, in order to provide additional financial flexibility to TDS and U.S. Cellular, and may also seek other changes to such agreements. There is no assurance that the lenders will agree to any amendments. If the lenders agree to amendments, this may result in additional payments or higher interest rates payable to the lenders and/or additional restrictions. Restrictions in such debt instruments may limit TDS\u2019 operating and financial flexibility.\nAs a result, TDS\u2019 level of indebtedness, restrictions contained in debt instruments and/or possible breaches of covenants, defaults, and acceleration of indebtedness could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\n5)\nChanges in roaming practices or other factors could cause TDS\u2019 roaming revenues to decline from current levels, roaming expenses to increase from current levels and/or impact TDS\u2019 ability to service its customers in geographic areas where TDS does not have its own network, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 revenues include roaming revenues related to the use of TDS\u2019 network by other wireless carriers\u2019 customers who travel within TDS\u2019 coverage areas. Changes in FCC rules or actions, industry practices or the network footprints of carriers due to mergers, acquisitions or network expansions could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 roaming revenues. For example, consolidation among other carriers which have network footprints that currently overlap TDS\u2019 network could decrease the amount of roaming revenues for TDS.\nSimilarly, TDS\u2019 wireless customers can access another carrier\u2019s network automatically only if the other carrier allows TDS\u2019 customers to roam on its network. TDS relies on roaming agreements with other carriers to provide roaming capability to its customers in areas of the U.S. and internationally outside of its service areas and to improve coverage within selected areas of TDS\u2019 network footprint. Such agreements cover traditional voice services as well as data services. Although TDS currently has long-term roaming agreements with certain other carriers, these agreements generally are subject to renewal and termination if certain events occur. FCC rules and orders impose certain requirements on wireless carriers to offer certain roaming arrangements to other carriers. However, carriers frequently disagree on what is required. Although TDS has entered into roaming agreements with national carriers, there is no assurance that TDS will be able to maintain these agreements and/or enter into new agreements with other carriers to provide roaming services or that it will be able to do so on reasonable or cost-effective terms.\nSome competitors may be able to obtain lower roaming rates than TDS is able to obtain because they have larger data usage or call volumes or may be able to reduce roaming charges by providing service principally over their own networks. In addition, the quality of service that a wireless carrier delivers to a TDS customer while roaming may be inferior to the quality of service TDS provides, the price charged by TDS for an international roaming call may not be competitive with prices other wireless carriers charge for such call, TDS\u2019 customers may not be able to use some of the advanced features that TDS customers enjoy when making calls on TDS\u2019 network (e.g., voicemail notification or data applications), and TDS customers\u2019 service experience may be negatively impacted, particularly when accessing data services, upon reaching a defined allotment of high-speed usage. TDS\u2019 rate of adoption of new technologies, such as those enabling high-speed data and voice services, could affect its ability to enter into or maintain roaming agreements with other carriers. In addition, TDS\u2019 wireless technology may not be compatible with technologies used by other carriers, which may limit the ability of TDS to enter into voice or data roaming agreements with such other carriers. Carriers whose customers roam on TDS\u2019 network could switch their business to new operators, limit their high-speed usage or, over time, move traffic to their own networks. Changes in roaming usage patterns, rates for roaming usage, or roaming relationships with other carriers could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 roaming revenues and/or expenses.\nTo the extent that other carriers expand their networks in TDS\u2019 service areas, the roaming arrangements between TDS and these other carriers could become less strategic for them. That is, these other carriers will have fewer or less extensive geographic areas where roaming services are required by their customers and, as a result, the roaming arrangements could become less critical to serving their customer base. This presents a risk to TDS in that, to the extent TDS is not able to enter into economically viable roaming arrangements with these other carriers, this could impact TDS\u2019 ability to service its customers in geographic areas where TDS does not have its own network.\nIf TDS\u2019 roaming revenues decline, or its roaming expenses increase, or if TDS is unable to obtain or maintain roaming agreements with other carriers that contain pricing and other terms that are competitive and acceptable to TDS and that satisfy TDS\u2019 quality and interoperability requirements, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n6)\nA failure by TDS to obtain access to adequate radio spectrum to meet current or anticipated future needs and/or to accurately predict future needs for radio spectrum could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 wireless business depends on the ability to use portions of the radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. TDS could fail to obtain access to sufficient spectrum capacity, including spectrum needed to support 5G technology, in new or existing markets, whether through FCC auctions or other transactions, in order to meet the anticipated spectrum requirements associated with increased demand for existing services, especially increases in customer demand for data services, and to enable deployment of next-generation services. TDS believes that this increased demand for data services reflects a trend that will continue for the foreseeable future. Data usage, including usage under unlimited plans, could exceed current forecasts resulting in a need for increased investment in spectrum or network. TDS could fail to accurately forecast its future spectrum requirements considering changes in plan offerings, customer usage patterns, technology requirements and the expanded demands of new services. Such a failure could have an adverse impact on the quality of TDS\u2019 services or TDS\u2019 ability to roll out such future services in some markets, or could require that TDS curtail existing services in order to make spectrum available for next-generation services. Spectrum constrained providers could be effectively capped in increasing market share. As spectrum constrained providers gain customers, they use up their network capacity. Since they lack spectrum, they can respond to demand only by adding cell sites, which is capital intensive, adds fixed operating costs, is limited by zoning considerations, and ultimately may not be cost effective.\nTDS may acquire access to spectrum through a number of alternatives, including acquisitions, exchanges and participation in spectrum auctions. TDS may participate in spectrum auctions conducted by the FCC in the future. As required by law, the FCC has conducted auctions for wireless spectrum licenses to use some parts of the radio spectrum. The decision to conduct auctions, and the determination of what spectrum frequencies will be made available for auction and the determination of geographic size of wireless spectrum licenses, are made by the FCC pursuant to laws that it administers. The FCC may not be able to allocate spectrum sufficient to meet the demands of all those wishing to obtain wireless spectrum licenses for new market entry or to expand their spectrum holdings to meet the expanding demand for data services or to address other spectrum constraints. Due to factors such as geographic size of wireless spectrum licenses and auction bidders that may raise prices beyond acceptable levels, TDS may not be successful in FCC auctions in obtaining access to the spectrum that it believes is necessary to implement its business and technology strategies.\nIn addition, newly auctioned spectrum may not be compatible with existing spectrum, and vendors may not create suitable products to use such spectrum. Further, access to wireless spectrum licenses won in FCC auctions may not be available on a timely basis. Such access is dependent upon the FCC actually granting wireless spectrum licenses won, which can be delayed for various reasons. Furthermore, newly licensed spectrum may not be available for immediate use since the radio operations of incumbent users, including in some cases government agencies, may need to be relocated to other portions of the radio spectrum, and/or the newly licensed spectrum may be subject to sharing and coordination obligations. TDS also may seek to acquire radio spectrum through purchases and exchanges with other licensees. However, TDS may not be able to acquire sufficient spectrum through these types of transactions, and TDS may not be able to complete any of these transactions on favorable terms.\n7)\nTo the extent conducted by the FCC, TDS may participate in FCC auctions for additional spectrum or for funding in certain Universal Service programs in the future directly or indirectly and, during certain periods, will be subject to the FCC\u2019s anti-collusion rules, which could have an adverse effect on TDS.\nFrom time to time, the FCC has conducted auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services, or through which universal service support funding is dispersed. TDS has participated in such auctions in the past and may participate in other auctions conducted by the FCC in the future. FCC anti-collusion rules place certain restrictions on business communications and disclosures by participants in an FCC auction. These anti-collusion rules may restrict the normal conduct of TDS\u2019 business, TDS\u2019 acquisition, divestiture, exchange and other corporate development activity and/or disclosures by TDS relating to an FCC auction. The restrictions could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n8)\nFailure by TDS to timely or fully comply with any existing applicable legislative and/or regulatory requirements or changes thereto could adversely affect TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FCC, state public utility commissions and other federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. Changes in the administration of the various regulatory agencies and legislative bodies could result in different policies with respect to many federal laws and regulations, including but not limited to changes to fiscal and tax policies, trade policies and tariffs on import goods. New or amended regulatory requirements could increase TDS\u2019 costs and divert resources from other initiatives. Adverse decisions, increased regulation, or changes to existing regulation by regulatory bodies could negatively impact TDS\u2019 operations by, among other things, permitting greater competition or limiting TDS\u2019 ability to engage in certain sales or marketing activities, or retention and recruitment of skilled resources. New regulatory mandates or enforcement may require unexpected or increased capital expenditures, lost revenues, higher operating expenses or other changes. Court decisions and rulemakings could have a substantial impact on TDS\u2019 operations, including rulemakings on broadband access to the internet, intercarrier access compensation, state and federal support funding, and treatment of VoIP traffic or unbundled network elements. Litigation and different objectives among federal and state regulators could create uncertainty and delay TDS\u2019 ability to respond to new regulations. Further, wireless spectrum licenses are subject to renewal by the FCC and could be revoked in the event of a violation of applicable laws or regulatory requirements. Also, although FCC rules relating to net neutrality have been repealed, some state legislators and regulators are seeking to or have already enacted state laws to reinstate net neutrality regulations and other rules. Interpretation and application of these rules, including conflicts between federal and state laws, may result in additional costs for compliance and may limit opportunities to derive profits from certain business practices or resources. For additional information related to TDS\u2019 regulatory environment, see Risk Factor Number 15 below and \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.\nTDS attempts to timely and fully comply with all regulatory requirements. However, TDS is unable to predict the future actions of the various legislative and regulatory bodies that govern TDS, but such actions could have adverse effects on TDS\u2019 business. Any failure by TDS to timely or fully comply with any regulatory requirements could adversely affect TDS\u2019 financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business.\n9)\nAn inability to attract people of outstanding talent throughout all levels of the organization, to develop their potential through education and assignments, and to retain them by keeping them engaged, challenged and properly rewarded could have an adverse effect on TDS' business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 businesses are highly technical and competition for skilled talent in the telecommunications and IT services industries is intense. Due to competition and/or limited supply for qualified management, technical, sales and other personnel, there can be no assurance that TDS will be able to continue to attract and/or retain people of outstanding potential for the development of its business. The loss of the services of existing key personnel due to competition and/or retirements as well as the failure to recruit additional qualified personnel in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe market for highly skilled leaders in the telecommunications industry also is extremely competitive. The future success of TDS and its businesses depends in substantial part on TDS\u2019 ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly skilled leaders for all areas of its organization. The loss of any of TDS\u2019 key leaders could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. Effective succession planning is also important to TDS\u2019 long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving key employees could also adversely affect TDS\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\n10)\nTDS\u2019 assets and revenue are concentrated primarily in the U.S. telecommunications industry. Consequently, its operating results may fluctuate based on factors related primarily to conditions in this industry.\nThe U.S. telecommunications industry is facing significant change and an uncertain operating environment. TDS\u2019 focus on the U.S. telecommunications industry, together with its positioning relative to larger competitors with greater resources within the industry, may represent increased risk for investors due to the lack of diversification. This could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 ability to attain and sustain long-term, profitable revenue growth and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\n11)\nTDS\u2019 smaller scale relative to larger competitors that may have greater financial and other resources than TDS could cause TDS to be unable to compete successfully, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere has been a trend in the telecommunications, IT services and related industries towards consolidation of service providers through acquisitions, reorganizations and joint ventures. This trend could continue, leading to larger competitors over time. TDS has smaller scale efficiencies compared to larger competitors. TDS may be unable to compete successfully with larger companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources or that offer more services than TDS, which could adversely affect TDS\u2019 revenues and costs of doing business. Specifically, TDS\u2019 smaller scale relative to most of its competitors could have the following impacts, among others:\n\u25aa\nLow profit margins and returns on investment that are below TDS\u2019 cost of capital;\n\u25aa\nIncreased operating costs due to lack of leverage with vendors;\n\u25aa\nInability to successfully deploy 5G or other wireless technologies, or to realize significant incremental revenues from their deployment;\n\u25aa\nLimited opportunities for strategic partnerships as potential partners are focused on wireless, wireline, cable and IT services companies with greater scale and scope;\n\u25aa\nLimited access to content, as well as limited ability to obtain acceptably priced content and programming;\n\u25aa\nLimited ability to influence industry standards;\n\u25aa\nReduced ability to invest in research and development of new services and products;\n\u25aa\nVendors may deem TDS non-strategic and not develop or sell services and products to TDS, particularly where technical requirements differ from those of larger companies;\n\u25aa\nLimited access to intellectual property; and\n\u25aa\nOther limited opportunities such as for software development or third party distribution.\nTDS\u2019 telecommunications businesses increasingly depend on access to content for data and access to new wireless devices being developed by vendors. TDS\u2019 ability to obtain such access depends in part on other parties. If TDS is unable to obtain timely access to new content or wireless devices being developed by vendors, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the foregoing, TDS\u2019 smaller scale relative to larger competitors could adversely affect TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n12)\nChanges in various business factors, including changes in demand, consumer preferences and perceptions, price competition, churn from customer switching activity and other factors, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in any of several factors could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aa\nDemand for or usage of services, particularly data services;\n\u25aa\nConsumer preferences, including internet speed and type of wireless devices;\n\u25aa\nConsumer perceptions of network quality and performance;\n\u25aa\nConsumer expectations for self-service options through digital means;\n\u25aa\nThe pricing of services, including an increase in price-based competition;\n\u25aa\nAccess to and cost of programming;\n\u25aa\nThe overall size and growth rate of TDS\u2019 customer base;\n\u25aa\nPenetration rates;\n\u25aa\nChurn rates;\n\u25aa\nSelling expenses;\n\u25aa\nNet customer acquisition and retention costs;\n\u25aa\nCustomers\u2019 ability to pay for services and the potential impact on bad debts expense;\n\u25aa\nRoaming agreements and rates;\n\u25aa\nThird-party vendor support;\n\u25aa\nCapacity constraints;\n\u25aa\nThe mix of services and products offered by TDS and purchased by customers;\n\u25aa\nThe costs of providing services and products; and\n\u25aa\nMid-market demand for cloud and hosted services.\n13)\nAdvances or changes in technology could render certain technologies used by TDS obsolete, could put TDS at a competitive disadvantage, could reduce TDS\u2019 revenues or could increase its costs of doing business.\nThe telecommunications and IT services industries are experiencing significant changes in technologies and services expected by customers. In the telecommunications industry, this is evidenced by evolving industry standards, ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter development cycles for new services and products, and enhancements and changes in end-user requirements and preferences. Widespread deployment of new technologies, including 5G and VoLTE technology, could cause the technology used on TDS\u2019 wireless networks and devices, including CDMA technology, traditional circuit-switched or IP-based networks, and cable networks to become less competitive or obsolete. Also, high-speed wireless networks (wireless broadband) represent a product offering and opportunity for TDS\u2019 wireless business, but also represent a risk for TDS\u2019 Wireline and Cable businesses as customers may elect to substitute their wireline or cable broadband connection with wireless broadband. Further, fixed-mobile convergence services that combine wireline broadband services with mobile services represent a competitive threat. If the trend toward convergence continues, TDS is at a competitive disadvantage to larger competitors, including the national wireless carriers and other potential large new entrants with much greater financial and other resources in adapting to such convergence. In addition, the IT services market is characterized by rapidly changing technology and services. Future technological changes or advancements may enable other technologies to equal or exceed TDS\u2019 current levels of service and render its system infrastructure obsolete. TDS may not be able to respond to such changes and implement new technology on a timely or cost-effective basis, which could reduce its revenues or increase its costs of doing business. If TDS cannot keep pace with these technological changes or other changes in the telecommunications or IT services industries over time, its financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business could be adversely affected.\n14)\nComplexities associated with deploying new technologies present substantial risk and TDS\u2019 investments in unproven technologies may not produce the benefits that TDS expects.\nTDS\u2019 wireless business has completed the transition to 4G LTE and has implemented 4G LTE as well as VoLTE roaming agreements with national carriers. VoLTE technology is now available to nearly 70% of U.S. Cellular's subscribers, and deployments in additional operating markets are expected in 2020 and 2021. In addition, TDS' wireless business has begun to deploy 5G technology in its network and expects to launch commercial 5G services in selected markets in 2020. The deployment of 5G technology will require substantial investments in TDS' wireless networks to remain competitive in the industry. Transition to 5G or other new technologies involves significant time, cost and risk, and anticipated products and revenues may not be realized. Furthermore, the wireless business experiences rapid technology changes and new services and products. If TDS fails to effectively deploy new wireless technologies, services or products on a timely basis, this could have an adverse impact on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 Wireline business is deploying fiber-to-the-home technology, advanced wireline, broadband, and TDS TV+ services through fiber-to-the-node, copper bonding and vectoring technology. A significant amount of the product development and integration risks are borne by TDS. Further, the simultaneous rollout of these advanced services and technologies increases the execution risk. If TDS fails to effectively deploy new technologies and products on a timely basis, this could have an adverse impact on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCable\u2019s business is also subject to complexities associated with deploying new technologies, such as DOCSIS 3.1, and involves substantial risk, including rapid technology changes. If Cable\u2019s business does not respond appropriately to technology changes, its competitive position may be adversely affected.\nThe HMS business is also continuously evaluating and deploying advances in technology relating to IT services. If HMS fails to effectively deploy new technologies and products on a timely basis, this could have an adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, it is not certain that TDS\u2019 investments in various new, unproven technologies and the related service and product offerings will be effective. The markets for some of these services, products and solutions may still be emerging and the overall potential for these markets, including revenues to be realized, may be uncertain. If customer demand for these new services, products and solutions does not develop as expected, TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n15)\nTDS receives regulatory support and is subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments, and the applicability and the amount of the support and fees are subject to great uncertainty, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTelecommunications companies may be designated by states, or in some cases by the FCC, as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) to receive universal service support payments if they provide specified services in \u201chigh cost\u201d areas. U.S. Cellular has been designated as an ETC in certain states and received $92 million in high cost support for service to high cost areas in 2019. TDS Telecom also received support under the Connect America Fund support program. In 2019, TDS Telecom received $86 million under all federal regulatory support programs.\nIn 2011, the FCC released an order (USF Order) to: reform its universal service and intercarrier compensation mechanisms; establish a new, broadband-focused support mechanism; and propose further rules to advance reform. For a discussion of the USF Order and risks to such regulatory support, see \u201cRegulatory Matters - FCC Mobility Fund/5G Fund\u201d in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference herein. If the foregoing regulatory support is reduced from current levels, this could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or operating results.\nIn 2016, the FCC released an order modifying the existing USF program under which TDS Telecom receives annual support revenue in exchange for meeting defined build-out obligations. Build-out obligations under this program will require capital expenditures which are expected to be significant. There is no assurance that these build-outs will be fully funded by the support revenue received under the program. In addition, failure to meet the defined build-out obligations could result in reduced support revenue. For developments that will result in changes to the FCC\u2019s Alternative Connect America Cost Model (A-CAM) program see \u201cRegulatory Matters - FCC Connect America Fund,\u201d in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference herein.\nTelecommunications providers pay a variety of surcharges and fees on their gross revenues from interstate and intrastate services, including USF fees and common carrier regulatory fees.\nThe division of services between interstate services and intrastate services, including the divisions associated with Federal USF fees, is a matter of interpretation and in the future may be contested by the FCC or state authorities. The FCC in the future also may change the basis on which Federal USF fees are charged. The Federal government and many states also apply transaction-based taxes to sales of telecommunications services and products and to purchases of telecommunications services from various carriers. In addition, state regulators and local governments have imposed and may continue to impose various surcharges, taxes and fees on telecommunications services. The applicability of these surcharges and fees to TDS\u2019 services is uncertain in many cases and jurisdictions may contest whether TDS has assessed and remitted those monies correctly. Periodically, state and federal regulators may increase or change the surcharges and fees TDS currently pays. In some instances, TDS passes through these charges to its customers. However, Congress, the FCC, state regulatory agencies or state legislatures may limit the ability to pass through transaction-based tax liabilities, regulatory surcharges and regulatory fees imposed on TDS to customers. TDS may or may not be able to recover some or all of those taxes from its customers and the amount of taxes may deter demand for its services or increase its cost to provide service which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results.\n16)\nChanges in TDS\u2019 enterprise value, changes in the market supply or demand for wireless spectrum licenses, wireline or cable markets or IT service providers, adverse developments in the businesses or the industries in which TDS is involved and/or other factors could require TDS to recognize impairments in the carrying value of its wireless spectrum licenses, goodwill, franchise rights and/or physical assets or require re-evaluation of the indefinite-lived nature of such assets.\nA large portion of TDS\u2019 assets consists of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the form of wireless spectrum licenses and goodwill. TDS also has substantial investments in long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment and franchise rights. TDS reviews its wireless spectrum licenses, goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss may need to be recognized to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of such assets. The amount of any such impairment loss could be significant and could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 reported financial results for the period in which the loss is recognized. The estimation of fair values requires assumptions by management about factors that are uncertain. Different assumptions for these factors could create materially different results.\n17)\nCosts, integration problems or other factors associated with acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges of properties or wireless spectrum licenses and/or expansion of TDS\u2019 businesses could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs part of TDS\u2019 operating strategy, TDS from time to time may be engaged in the acquisition, divestiture or exchange of companies, businesses, strategic properties, wireless spectrum or other assets. TDS may change the markets in which it operates and the services that it provides through such acquisitions, divestitures and/or exchanges. In general, TDS may not disclose the negotiation of such transactions until a definitive agreement has been reached. These transactions commonly involve a number of risks, including:\n\u25aa\nIdentification of attractive companies, businesses, properties, spectrum or other assets for acquisition or exchange, and/or the selection of TDS\u2019 businesses or assets for divestiture or exchange;\n\u25aa\nCompetition for acquisition targets and the ability to acquire or exchange businesses at reasonable prices;\n\u25aa\nInability to make acquisitions that would achieve sufficient scale to be competitive with competitors with greater scale;\n\u25aa\nPossible lack of buyers for businesses or assets that TDS desires to divest and the ability to divest or exchange such businesses or assets at reasonable prices;\n\u25aa\nAbility to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u25aa\nSignificant expenditures associated with acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u25aa\nRisks associated with integrating new businesses or markets, including risks relating to cybersecurity and privacy;\n\u25aa\nAbility to enter markets in which TDS has limited or no direct prior experience and competitors have stronger positions;\n\u25aa\nAbility to integrate and manage TDS\u2019 different business operations and services, including wireless services, traditional wireline services, cable businesses and hosted and managed services businesses;\n\u25aa\nUncertain revenues and expenses associated with acquisitions, with the result that TDS may not realize the growth in revenues, anticipated cost structure, profitability, or return on investment that it expects;\n\u25aa\nDifficulty of integrating the technologies, services, products, operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, or of separating such matters for divested businesses or assets;\n\u25aa\nDiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25aa\nDisruption of ongoing business;\n\u25aa\nImpact on TDS\u2019 cash and available credit lines for use in financing future growth and working capital needs;\n\u25aa\nInability to retain key personnel;\n\u25aa\nInability to successfully incorporate acquired assets and rights into TDS\u2019 service offerings;\n\u25aa\nInability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25aa\nPossible conditions to approval by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Department of Justice; and\n\u25aa\nImpairment of relationships with employees, customers or vendors.\nNo assurance can be given that TDS will be successful with respect to its acquisition, divestiture or exchange strategies or initiatives. If TDS is not successful with respect to its acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n18)\nA failure by TDS to complete significant network construction and systems implementation activities as part of its plans to improve the quality, coverage, capabilities and capacity of its network, support and other systems and infrastructure could have an adverse effect on its operations.\nTDS\u2019 business plan includes significant construction activities and enhancements to its network, support and other systems and infrastructure. Additionally, the deployment of new wireless technologies, including 5G, may require substantial investments in TDS' wireless network. As TDS deploys, expands and enhances its wireless network, it may need to acquire additional spectrum. Also, as TDS continues to build out and enhance its network, TDS must, among other things, continue to:\n\u25aa\nLease, acquire or otherwise obtain rights to cell and switch sites, transport facilities, data centers relating to IT services or other facilities;\n\u25aa\nObtain zoning variances or other local governmental or third-party approvals or permits for network construction;\n\u25aa\nComplete and update the radio frequency design, including cell site design, frequency planning and network optimization, for each of TDS\u2019 wireless markets; and\n\u25aa\nImprove, expand and maintain customer care, network management, billing and other financial and management systems.\nAny difficulties encountered in completing these activities, as well as problems in vendor equipment availability, technical resources, system performance or system adequacy, could delay implementation and deployment of new technologies, delay expansion of operations and product capabilities in new or existing markets or result in increased costs. Failure to successfully deploy new technologies, including 5G, and/or build-out and enhance TDS\u2019 network, support facilities and other systems and infrastructure in a cost-effective manner, and in a manner that satisfies consumers' expectations, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS\u2019 Wireline and Cable businesses are devoting an increasing amount of capital for fiber overbuilds and out of territory construction. Difficulties in gaining acceptance from new market communities could cause delays or additional costs. Any difficulties in scaling up project management, engineering and construction resources could delay construction and expansion of operations in new or existing markets or result in increased costs. Failure to gain acceptance in new communities and successfully scale up resources could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\n19)\nDifficulties involving third parties with which TDS does business, including changes in TDS\u2019 relationships with or financial or operational difficulties of key suppliers or independent agents and third party national retailers who market TDS\u2019 services, could adversely affect TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS has relationships with independent agents and third party national retailers who market TDS\u2019 services. If such relationships are seriously harmed or if such parties experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTDS depends upon certain vendors to provide it with equipment (including wireless devices), services or content that meet its quality and cost requirements on a timely basis to continue its network construction and upgrades, and to operate its business. TDS does not have operational or financial control over such key suppliers and has limited influence with respect to the manner in which these key suppliers conduct their businesses. If these key suppliers (i) experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy or experience other operational difficulties or (ii) deem TDS non-strategic and not develop or sell services and products to TDS, particularly where technical requirements differ from those of larger companies, they may not provide equipment, services or content to TDS on a timely basis, or at all, or they may otherwise fail to honor their obligations to TDS. Furthermore, consolidation among key suppliers may result in less competition and higher prices or the discontinuation of support for equipment owned by TDS.\nOperation of TDS\u2019 supply chain and management of its inventory require accurate forecasting of customer growth and demand, which has become increasingly challenging. If overall demand for wireless devices or the mix of demand for wireless devices is significantly different than TDS\u2019 expectations, TDS could face inadequate or excess supplies of particular models of wireless devices. This could result in lost sales opportunities or an excess supply of inventory. Further, TDS' supply chain could be disrupted unexpectedly by raw material shortages, wars, natural disasters, disease or other factors. Any of these situations could adversely affect TDS\u2019 revenues, costs of doing business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAlso, TDS has other arrangements with third parties, including arrangements pursuant to which TDS outsources certain support functions to third party vendors. Operational problems associated with such functions, including any failure by the vendor to provide the required level of service under the outsourcing arrangements, including possible cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security or privacy, could have adverse effects on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n20)\nTDS has significant investments in entities that it does not control. Losses in the value of such investments could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS has significant investments in entities that it does not control, including equity investments and interests in certain variable interest entities. TDS\u2019 interests in such entities do not provide TDS with control over the business strategy, financial goals, network build-out plans or other operational aspects of these entities. TDS cannot provide assurance that these entities will operate in a manner that will increase or maintain the value of TDS\u2019 investments, that TDS\u2019 proportionate share of income from these investments will continue at the current level in the future or that TDS will not incur losses from the holding of such investments. Losses in the values of such investments or a reduction in income from these investments could adversely affect TDS\u2019 financial condition or results of operations. In addition, certain investments have historically contributed significant cash flows to TDS and a reduction or suspension of such cash flows could adversely affect TDS\u2019 financial condition.\n21)\nA failure by TDS to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technology, or a material disruption thereof, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS relies extensively on its telecommunication networks and information technology to operate and manage its businesses, process transactions and summarize and report results. These networks and technology are subject to obsolescence and, consequently, must be upgraded, replaced and/or otherwise enhanced over time. Enhancements must be more flexible and dependable than ever before. All of this is capital intensive and challenging. A failure by TDS to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technology could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe increased provision of data services, including IPTV, has introduced significant new demands on TDS\u2019 network and also has increased complexities related to network management. As it relates to Wireline\u2019s networks, the transition to new IP-based networks from well-established time-division multiplexing networks requires new support tools and technician skills. Further, this transition requires the use of more leased facilities and partnerships which require enhanced network monitoring and controls. The IP-based networks also generally require more electronics on customers\u2019 premises which introduces more technical risks and makes diagnostics and repairs more difficult.\nFurther, the increased provision of data services on TDS\u2019 networks has created an increased level of risk related to quality of service. This is due to the fact that many customers increasingly rely on data communications to execute and validate transactions. As a result, redundancy and geographical diversity of TDS\u2019 network facilities are critical to providing uninterrupted service. Also, the speed of repair and maintenance procedures in the event of network interruptions is critical to maintaining customer satisfaction. TDS\u2019 ability to maintain high-quality, uninterrupted service to its customers is critical, particularly given the increasingly competitive environment and customers\u2019 ability to choose other service providers.\nIn addition, TDS\u2019 networks and information technology and the networks and information technology of vendors on which TDS relies are subject to damage or interruption due to various events, including power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, hackers and other cyber security risks, catastrophic events, natural disasters, errors or unauthorized actions by employees and vendors, flawed conversion of systems, disruptive technologies and technology changes.\n22)\nTDS has experienced, and in the future expects to experience, cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security of varying degrees on a regular basis, which could have an adverse effect on TDS' business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS experiences cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. These include cyber-attacks intended to wrongfully obtain private and valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events, including denial of service attacks which may cause TDS' services to be disrupted or unavailable to customers. TDS maintains administrative, technical and physical controls, as well as other preventative actions, to reduce the risk of security breaches. Although to date TDS has not discovered a material security breach, these efforts may be insufficient to prevent a material security breach stemming from future cyber-attacks. If TDS\u2019 or its vendors\u2019 networks and information technology are not adequately adapted to changes in technology or are damaged or fail to function properly, and/or if TDS\u2019 or its vendors\u2019 security is breached or otherwise compromised, TDS could suffer adverse consequences, including theft, destruction or other loss of critical and private data, including customer and/or employee data, interruptions or delays in its operations, inaccurate billings, inaccurate financial reporting, and significant costs to remedy the problems. If TDS\u2019 or its vendors\u2019 systems become unavailable or suffer a security breach of customer or other data, TDS may be required to expend significant resources and take various actions to address the problems, including notification under data privacy laws and regulations, may be subject to fines, sanctions and litigation, and its reputation and operating results could be adversely affected. Such events may also cause TDS to fail to satisfy service level commitments or trigger contractual obligations to customers of its IT services. TDS continues to experience denial of service attacks. Although TDS has implemented and continues to enhance its protection and recovery measures in response to such attacks, these efforts may be insufficient to prevent a material denial of service attack in the future. Any material disruption in TDS\u2019 networks or information technology, including security breaches, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n23)\nChanges in facts or circumstances, including new or additional information, could require TDS to record adjustments to amounts reflected in the financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires TDS to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. TDS bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in facts or circumstances, including new or additional information, could require TDS to record charges in excess of amounts accrued in the financial statements, if any, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n24)\nDisruption in credit or other financial markets, a deterioration of U.S. or global economic conditions or other events could, among other things, impede TDS\u2019 access to or increase the cost of financing its operating and investment activities and/or result in reduced revenues and lower operating income and cash flows, which would have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDisruptions in the credit and financial markets, declines in consumer confidence, increases in unemployment, declines in economic growth, increased tariffs on import goods and uncertainty about corporate earnings could have a significant negative impact on the U.S. and global financial and credit markets and the overall economy. Such events could have an adverse impact on financial institutions resulting in limited access to capital and credit for many companies. Furthermore, economic uncertainties make it very difficult to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Changes in economic conditions, changes in financial markets, changes in U.S. trade policies, deterioration in the capital markets or other factors could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\n25)\nSettlements, judgments, restraints on its current or future manner of doing business and/or legal costs resulting from pending and future litigation could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS is regularly involved in a number of legal and policy proceedings before the FCC and various state and federal courts. Such legal and policy proceedings can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel.\nThe assessment of legal and policy proceedings is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events. Additionally, amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or resolution of litigation and other contingencies may differ materially from amounts accrued in the financial statements. Depending on a range of factors, these or similar proceedings could impose restraints on TDS\u2019 current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business.\n26)\nThe possible development of adverse precedent in litigation or conclusions in professional studies to the effect that radio frequency emissions from wireless devices and/or cell sites cause harmful health consequences, including cancer or tumors, or may interfere with various electronic medical devices such as pacemakers, could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 wireless business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMedia reports and certain professional studies have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless devices may be linked to various health problems, including cancer or tumors, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. TDS is a party to and may in the future be a party to lawsuits against wireless carriers and other parties claiming damages for alleged health effects, including cancer or tumors, arising from wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may discourage use of wireless devices or expose TDS to potential litigation. In addition, the FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt regulations in response to concerns about radio frequency emissions. Any resulting decrease in demand for wireless services, costs of litigation and damage awards or regulation could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, some studies have indicated that some aspects of using a wireless device while driving may impair a driver's attention in certain circumstances, making accidents more likely. These concerns could lead to potential litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries, any of which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n27)\nClaims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, primarily involving patent infringement claims, could prevent TDS from using necessary technology to provide products or services or subject TDS to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTDS faces possible effects of industry litigation relating to patents, other intellectual property or otherwise, that may restrict TDS\u2019 access to devices or network equipment critical to providing services to customers. If technology that TDS uses in products or services were determined by a court to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another person, TDS could be precluded from using that technology and could be required to pay significant monetary damages. TDS also may be required to pay significant royalties to such person to continue to use such technology in the future. The successful enforcement of any intellectual property rights, or TDS\u2019 inability to negotiate a license for such rights on acceptable terms, could force TDS to cease using the relevant technology and offering services incorporating the technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that TDS\u2019 products or services infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the effort and attention of TDS\u2019 management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, TDS cannot give assurance that it would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. Although TDS generally seeks to obtain indemnification agreements from vendors that provide it with technology, there can be no assurance that any claim of infringement will be covered by an indemnity or that TDS will be able to recover all or any of its losses and costs under any available indemnity agreements. Any claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent TDS from using necessary technology to provide its services or subject TDS to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on TDS\u2019 business, financial condition or results of operations.\n28)\nCertain matters, such as control by the TDS Voting Trust and provisions in the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation, may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of TDS or have other consequences.\nThe TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the TDS bylaws contain provisions which may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of TDS without the support of the TDS Voting Trust and the TDS Board of Directors or without meeting various other conditions.\nThe TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of different series of common stock, which have different voting rights. The TDS Series A Common Shares have the power to elect approximately 75% (less one) of the directors and have ten votes per share in matters other than the election of directors. The TDS Common Shares (with one vote per share) vote as a separate group only with respect to the election of 25% (plus one) of the directors. In addition, the total percentage voting power in matters other than the election of directors of the Series A Common Shares and Common Shares are fixed, at 56.7% and 43.3%, respectively, subject to adjustment due to changes in the number of outstanding Series A Common Shares.\nA substantial majority of the outstanding TDS Series A Common Shares are held in the TDS Voting Trust which expires on June 30, 2035. The TDS Voting Trust was created to facilitate the long-standing relationships among the trustees\u2019 certificate holders. By virtue of the number of shares held by them, the voting trustees have the power to elect eight directors based on the current TDS Board of Directors\u2019 size of twelve directors, and control a majority of the voting power of TDS with respect to matters other than the election of directors.\nThe existence of the TDS Voting Trust is likely to deter any potential unsolicited or hostile takeover attempts or other efforts to obtain control of TDS and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell shares of TDS at higher than market prices. The trustees of the TDS Voting Trust have advised TDS that they intend to maintain the ability to keep or dispose of voting control of TDS.\nThe TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation also authorizes the TDS Board of Directors to designate and issue TDS Undesignated Shares in one or more classes or series of preferred or common stock from time to time. Generally, no further action or authorization by the shareholders is necessary prior to the designation or issuance of the additional TDS Undesignated Shares authorized pursuant to the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless applicable laws or regulations would require such approval in a given instance. Such TDS Undesignated Shares could be issued in circumstances that would serve to preserve control of TDS\u2019 then existing management.\nIn addition, the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision which authorizes the TDS Board of Directors to consider various factors, including effects on customers, taxes, and the long-term and short-term interests of TDS, in the context of a proposal or offer to acquire or merge the corporation, or to sell its assets, and to reject such offer if the TDS Board of Directors determines that the proposal is not in the best interests of the corporation based on such factors.\nThe provisions of the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the TDS bylaws and the existence of various classes of capital stock could prevent shareholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change in control of TDS by delaying or preventing such change in control.\nThe provisions of the TDS Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the existence of different classes of capital stock and voting rights could result in the exclusion of TDS Common Shares from certain major stock indices at some point in the future, unless TDS is grandfathered by such stock indices or qualifies for some other exception.\n29)\nThe market price of TDS\u2019 Common Shares is subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors.\nFactors that may affect the future market price of TDS\u2019 Common Shares include:\n\u25aa\nGeneral economic conditions, including conditions in the credit and financial markets;\n\u25aa\nIndustry conditions;\n\u25aa\nFluctuations in TDS\u2019 quarterly customer additions, churn rate, revenues, results of operations or cash flows;\n\u25aa\nVariations between TDS\u2019 actual financial and operating results and those expected by analysts and investors; and\n\u25aa\nAnnouncements by TDS\u2019 competitors.\nAny of these or other factors could adversely affect the future market price of TDS\u2019 Common Shares, or could cause the future market price of TDS\u2019 Common Shares to fluctuate from time to time.\n30)\nAny of the foregoing events or other events could cause revenues, earnings, capital expenditures and/or any other financial or statistical information to vary from TDS\u2019 forward-looking estimates by a material amount.\nFrom time to time, TDS may disclose forward-looking information, including estimates of future operating revenues; various measures of income before income taxes; and/or capital expenditures. Any such forward-looking information includes consideration of known or anticipated changes to the extent disclosed, but dynamic market conditions and/or other unknown or unanticipated events, including but not limited to the risks discussed above, could cause such estimates to differ materially from the actual amounts.", "PERMNO": 90655, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "TDS"}
