{"cik": "879635", "company": "MID PENN BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nBefore investing in Mid Penn common stock, an investor should carefully read and consider the risk factors described below, which are not intended to be all inclusive, and to review other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Mid Penn\u2019s holding company, the Bank, and nonbank subsidiaries. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of, or that we currently deem less significant, or that we are otherwise not specifically focused on, may also impact our business, results of operations, and our common stock. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and an investor could lose all or part of his or her investment in Mid Penn.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cMid Penn,\u201d or \u201cMid Penn Bancorp, Inc.,\u201d collectively refer to Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and specific references to the \u201cBank\u201d refer to Mid Penn Bank, the wholly-owned banking subsidiary of Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc.\nRisks Related to Our Primary Business and Industry\nMid Penn is subject to interest rate risk.\nMid Penn\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon the Bank\u2019s net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond Mid Penn\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest income the Bank receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest expense it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Bank\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of mortgage-backed securities in the Bank\u2019s investment portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, Mid Penn\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings.\nManagement believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies and interest rate risk management activities to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on Mid Penn\u2019s results of operations. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged, or rapid change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s net interest income and Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nMid Penn is subject to credit risk.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 88 percent of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio in Table 8 of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis consisted of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and agricultural loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or secured consumer loans. Commercial loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial loans, and construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. In addition, Mid Penn\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by Mid Penn cannot be readily realized or liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to Mid Penn. An increase in non-performing loans or collateral value deficiencies could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses may be not be sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses.\nMid Penn maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses, which is a reserve established that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; changes in present economic, political and regulatory conditions; other external factors such as the ongoing pandemic; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires Mid Penn to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, the impact of the ongoing pandemic, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem credits and other factors, both within and outside of Mid Penn\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Mid Penn\u2019s allowance for possible loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance, Mid Penn may need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan and lease losses. Any increases in the allowance resulting from loan loss provisions will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition from other financial institutions may adversely affect Mid Penn\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s profitability.\nMid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in originating both commercial and consumer loans. This competition comes principally from other banks, credit unions, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Many of its larger competitors who offer loans enjoy advantages over the Bank, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce Mid Penn\u2019s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that its banking subsidiary originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, the Bank faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as other commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of Mid Penn\u2019s larger competitors who accept deposits also enjoy advantages over the Bank, including greater financial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition, and more convenient branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than Mid Penn, which could decrease the deposits that the Bank attracts or require an increase in rates and interest expense to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect Mid Penn\u2019s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, Mid Penn may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase its cost of funds.\nMid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary and nonbank subsidiaries also compete with non-banking providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance agencies and governmental organizations, which may offer more favorable terms. Some of its non-banking competitors are not subject to the same extensive and costly regulations that govern Mid Penn\u2019s operations. As a result, such non-banking competitors may have advantages over Mid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary and nonbank subsidiaries in providing certain products and services. This competition may reduce or limit Mid Penn\u2019s margins on banking services, revenues from nonbanking subsidiaries\u2019 activities, reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nThe expected discontinuance of LIBOR presents risks to the financial instruments originated, issued or held by Mid Penn that use LIBOR as a reference rate.\nLIBOR is used as a reference rate for some of Mid Penn\u2019s transactions, which means it is the base on which relevant interest rates are determined. Transactions include those in which Mid Penn lends and borrows money; issues, purchases and sells securities; and enters into derivatives to manage Mid Penn\u2019s and its customers\u2019 risk. LIBOR is the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the process for setting LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. There are ongoing efforts to establish an alternative reference rate to LIBOR, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or \u201cSOFR\u201d, and ensure that all related legal documents, indices, and derivatives which are impacted by this change are updated accordingly.\nIf another rate does not achieve wide acceptance as the alternative to LIBOR, there likely will be disruption to all of the markets relying on the availability of a broadly accepted reference rate. Even if another reference rate ultimately replaces LIBOR, risks will remain for Mid Penn with respect to outstanding loans, derivatives or other instruments using LIBOR. Those risks arise in connection with transitioning those instruments to a new reference rate and the corresponding value transfer that may occur in connection with that transition. Risks related to transitioning instruments to a new reference rate or to how LIBOR is calculated and its availability include impacts on the yield on loans or securities held by Mid Penn, amounts paid on securities Mid Penn has issued, or amounts received and paid on derivative instruments Mid Penn has entered into. The value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR and the trading market for LIBOR-based securities could also be impacted upon its discontinuance or if it is limited. Further, it is possible that LIBOR quotes will become unavailable prior to 2021 if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. These risks may also be increased due to the shorter timeframe for preparing for the transition.\nThe Basel III capital requirements require Mid Penn to maintain higher levels of capital, which could reduce profitability.\nBasel III established higher levels of base capital, certain capital buffers, and a migration toward common equity as the key source of regulatory capital. Although these capital requirements have been phased in and met by Mid Penn, the Basel III requirements signal a growing effort by domestic and international bank regulatory agencies to require financial institutions, including depository institutions, to maintain higher levels of capital. The Basel III implementation activities and related regulatory capital targets required additional capital to support our business risk profile. Maintaining higher levels of capital potentially reduces opportunities to leverage interest-earning assets, which could limit the net interest income and profitability of Mid Penn, and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nActs of terrorism, natural disasters, global climate change, pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations.\nActs of terrorism, natural disasters, global climate change, pandemics, global conflicts or other similar events could have a negative impact on our business and operations. While we have business continuity plans in place, such events occurring or persisting, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business and our facilities (including communications and technology), result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees, and have a similar impact on our clients, suppliers, third-party vendors and counterparties. These events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or disruptions in general economic activity in the United States or abroad, or in financial market settlement functions. In addition, these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations, and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), we are subject to additional risks of litigation from our clients or other parties regarding our processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act, which included a loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. We are a participating as a lender in the PPP. The PPP opened on April 3, 2020; however, because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes the Corporation to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. Since the opening of the PPP, several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nthe PPP. We may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both clients and non-clients that approached us regarding PPP loans, regarding our process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a manner favorable to us, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant global and national economic downturn and unprecedented levels of unemployment, which may adversely affect, our business and results of operations, and the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global, national and local economies and our business, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant global and national economic downturn and unprecedented levels of unemployment, which has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, the Corporation\u2019s business and results of operations, and the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global, national and local economies and the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures are, among other things, severely restricting global and national economic activity, which is disrupting supply chains, lowering asset valuations, significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels, decreasing liquidity in markets for certain securities and causing significant volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. These measures have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, businesses, market participants, our counterparties and clients, and the global, national and local economies for a prolonged period of time. Should current economic conditions persist or continue to deteriorate, this economic environment could have a continued adverse effect on our business and operations, including but not limited to: decreased demand for our products and services; protracted periods of lower interest rates; lower asset management fees; and increased credit losses due to deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers, including declining asset and collateral values, which may result in an increase in our provision for credit losses and net charge-offs. Additionally, our liquidity and regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by customers\u2019 withdrawal of deposits, volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets, and customer draws on lines of credit. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the economy, and/or adversely affects our business, results of operations or financial condition, it may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks including those related to market, credit, and business operations.\nIn response to the economic and market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and regulatory authorities, including central banks, have acted to provide fiscal and monetary stimulus to support the global and national economy. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will stimulate the global and national economy or avert recessionary conditions in markets in which we conduct operations.\nWe continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks as they evolve. The magnitude, duration and likelihood of the current outbreak of COVID-19, further outbreaks of COVID-19, future actions taken by governmental authorities and/or other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its future direct and indirect effects on the global, national and local economies and our business and results of operation are highly uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause prolonged global, national or local recessionary economic conditions or longer lasting effects on economic conditions than currently exist, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nInterest rate volatility stemming from COVID-19 could negatively affect our net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability.\nOur net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability could be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from COVID-19. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent, citing concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on markets and stress in the energy sector. A prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, or financial condition.\nIf Mid Penn\u2019s information systems are interrupted or sustain a breach in security, those events may negatively affect Mid Penn\u2019s financial performance and reputation.\nIn conducting its business, Mid Penn relies heavily on its information systems. Maintaining and protecting those systems and data is difficult and expensive, as is dealing with any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems, whether due to acts or omissions by Mid Penn or by a third party, and whether intentional or not. Any such failure, interruption, or breach could result in failures or disruptions in Mid Penn\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. A breach of Mid Penn\u2019s information security may result from fraudulent activity committed against Mid Penn or its clients, resulting in financial loss to Mid Penn or its clients, or privacy breaches against Mid Penn\u2019s clients. Such fraudulent activity may consist of check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, \u201cphishing\u201d, social engineering, identity theft, or other deceptive acts. The policies, procedures, and technical safeguards put in place by Mid Penn to prevent or limit the effect of any failure, interruption, or security breach of its information systems and data may be insufficient to prevent or remedy the effects of any such occurrences. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of Mid Penn\u2019s information systems and data could damage Mid Penn\u2019s reputation, cause Mid Penn to incur additional expenses, result in online services or other businesses becoming inoperable, subject Mid Penn to regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose Mid Penn to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMid Penn\u2019s business operations and interaction with customers are increasingly done via technology and electronic delivery channels, and this has increased risks related to cyber-attacks and cyber incidents.\nMid Penn is exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks in the normal course of business. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. An increased level of attention in the industry is focused on cyber-attacks that include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. To combat against these attacks, Mid Penn has certain security systems and policies and procedures in place to prevent or limit the effect of the possible security breach of its information systems and it has insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks. While Mid Penn has not incurred any material losses related to cyber-attacks, nor is it aware of any specific or threatened cyber-incidents as of the date of this report, it may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if it falls victim to successful cyber-attacks. Such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repairing system damage that cyber-attacks may have caused; deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants; lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack; litigation; and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.\nWe are required to make a number of judgments in applying generally accepted accounting standards, and different estimates and assumptions in the application of these accounting standards could result in a decrease in capital and/or other material changes to our reports of financial condition and results of operations.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles involve certain estimates and processes that are particularly susceptible to significant change, including those related to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, the fair value of and potential impairment of certain financial instruments including investment securities, income tax assets or liabilities (including deferred tax assets and any related valuation allowance), and share-based compensation. While we have identified critical accounting policies and have procedures and processes in place to support making the related judgments and estimates, changes to the processes, assumptions, or models in the application of these generally accepted accounting principles, and the impact to the related judgments and estimates could result in a decrease to net income and, possibly, capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC issues changes to or updated interpretations of the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of Mid\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nPenn\u2019s financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict, and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. We could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively, which may result in the revision of prior financial statements by material amounts. The implementation of new or revised guidance could also result in material adverse effects to our reported capital.\nMid Penn\u2019s mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.\nMortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of market forces including mortgage interest rates, and real estate and refinancing activity. In lower interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will tend to increase. This has the effect of increasing fee income, but could adversely impact the estimated fair value of Mid Penn\u2019s mortgage servicing rights as the rate of loan prepayments increase. In higher interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and refinancing activity will generally be lower. This has the effect of decreasing mortgage loan originations and refinance activities, and related fee income opportunities.\nMid Penn could be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers due to breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nMid Penn originates and sells a significant amount of residential mortgage loans into the secondary market. When Mid Penn sells mortgage loans, Mid Penn is required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. The agreements pursuant to which the loans are sold require Mid Penn to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event there was a breach of any of these representations or warranties. In addition, Mid Penn may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase significantly, Mid Penn\u2019s liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nMid Penn\u2019s profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in Pennsylvania.\nUnlike larger or regional financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, Mid Penn\u2019s success is dependent to a significant degree on economic conditions in Pennsylvania, especially in the twelve counties and the specific markets primarily served by Mid Penn. The banking industry is affected by general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation, recession, unemployment, real estate values, trends in national and global economics, and other factors beyond our control. An economic recession or a delayed recovery over a prolonged period of time in Pennsylvania, or more specific to the counties or communities in Pennsylvania served by Mid Penn, could cause an increase in the level of the Bank\u2019s non-performing assets and loan and lease losses, thereby causing operating losses, impairing liquidity, and eroding capital. Mid Penn cannot assure that adverse changes in the local and state economy supporting its market area would not have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMid Penn is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nFrom time to time, customers may make claims and take legal action pertaining to Mid Penn\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to Mid Penn\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to Mid Penn, the claims or related litigation processes may result in significant financial expense and liability, and/or adversely affect the market perception of Mid Penn and its products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nMid Penn operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nMid Penn\u2019s holding company, the Bank, and its nonbank subsidiaries are collectively subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. The potential exists for additional or amended federal or state laws and regulations, or changes in supervisory policies or activities, to materially affect many aspects of Mid Penn\u2019s operations, including capital levels, lending and funding practices, and liquidity standards. New laws and regulations may increase costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and otherwise affect operations, and may significantly affect the markets in which Mid Penn does business, the markets for and value of Mid Penn\u2019s loans and investments, the ability to attract deposits at a reasonable cost, the fees charged, and ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further, additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect Mid Penn\u2019s powers, authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. Also, regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. Any changes in applicable regulations or federal, state or local legislation, or the exercise of bank regulatory authority, may have a negative impact on Mid Penn\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and its ability to pay dividends on common stock.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions may adversely affect Mid Penn.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. Mid Penn has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose Mid Penn to credit risk and losses in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nVolatility in financial markets and the economy may have materially adverse effects on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn the recent past, the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and economic disruption, including the most recent volatility and market stresses from the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse financial market and economic conditions can exert downward pressure on stock prices, security prices, and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to their underlying financial strength. If such levels of financial market and economic disruption and volatility return, there can be no assurance that Mid Penn will not experience adverse effects, which may materially affect its liquidity, financial condition, and profitability.\nMid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums or special assessments which may adversely affect its earnings.\nPoor economic conditions and the resulting bank failures from the most recent recession stressed the DIF and increased the costs of the Bank\u2019s FDIC insurance assessments. Future bank failures may prompt the FDIC to increase its premiums above the recently increased levels or to issue special assessments. Mid Penn generally is unable to control the amount of premiums or special assessments that its banking subsidiary is required to pay for FDIC insurance. Any future changes in the calculation or assessment of FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on the results of Mid Penn\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nIf we conclude that the decline in the value of any of our investment securities is other than temporary, we are required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings.\nMid Penn reviews its investment securities portfolio at each quarter-end reporting period to determine whether the fair value of individual securities or the portfolio as a whole is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of its investment securities has declined below its carrying value, Mid Penn is required to assess whether the decline is other than temporary. If Mid Penn concludes that the decline is other than temporary, it is required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings. Changes in the expected cash flows of these securities and/or prolonged price declines may result in Mid Penn concluding that impairment of these securities is other than temporary, which would require a charge to earnings to write down these securities to their fair value. Due to the complexity of the process, inputs, calculations and assumptions used in determining whether an investment is impaired, Mid Penn\u2019s assessment of or disclosure of the impairment status of investments may not accurately reflect the actual impairment in the future.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nMid Penn is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of Mid Penn\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, Mid Penn may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, Mid Penn may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require Mid Penn to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit Mid Penn\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase Mid Penn\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although Mid Penn has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMid Penn\u2019s financial performance may suffer if its information technology is unable to keep pace with its growth or industry developments.\nEffective and competitive delivery of Mid Penn\u2019s products and services is increasingly dependent upon information technology resources and processes provided both internally and through third party vendors. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables Mid Penn to reduce costs. Mid Penn\u2019s future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by effectively and safely using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience, attract customers who prefer technological delivery channels, and to create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many of Mid Penn\u2019s competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements and infrastructure. Additionally, as technology and information security requirements in the financial services industry change and evolve, keeping pace becomes increasingly complex and expensive for Mid Penn. There can be no assurance that Mid Penn will be able to effectively keep pace with these technological advancements or the related substantial costs and investments required, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowing by acquisition entails certain risks, and difficulties in integrating past or future acquisitions could adversely affect our business.\nIn 2018, Mid Penn completed acquisitions of both The Scottdale Bank & Trust Company and First Priority Financial Corp. and continued the integration of these acquisitions in the subsequent periods. Growth by acquisition involves substantial risks, as the ultimate success of such acquisitions may depend on, among other things, the ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to integrate the acquired companies and operation in a manner that does not result in decreased revenues. Excessive acquisition costs, conversion costs and the disruption of existing customer relationships in both the acquired companies and legacy markets may occur. If we are not able to successfully achieve the financial efficiencies or integration and growth objectives of acquisitions, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than planned.\nFurther, the asset quality or other financial characteristics of an acquired company may deteriorate from the date a merger or other acquisition agreement is entered into and when the transaction is completed or the post-merger period.\nMid Penn has spent and may continue to spend significant resources identifying companies and businesses to acquire. The efficient and effective integration of any companies and businesses we acquire and integrate into our organization is critical to our growth. The recent Scottdale and First Priority mergers, and any future mergers or acquisitions, involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the culture, operations, technologies and personnel of the acquired companies, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of customers. Failure to fully integrate the operations of Scottdale and First Priority successfully, or to integrate the operations of future acquisition targets, could harm Mid Penn\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe plan to pursue a growth strategy and there are risks associated with rapid growth.\nWe intend to pursue a growth plan consistent with our prior business strategy, including growth by acquisition, as well as leveraging our existing branch network or adding new branch locations or offices and personnel in current and adjacent markets we choose to serve. The Scottdale Merger and First Priority Merger were part of our growth strategy.\nOur ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel, maintain cost controls and efficiencies, and ensure our areas of growth continue to meet our high asset quality standards, while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as economic conditions and competition in existing and new markets. If we grow too quickly and are not able to attract qualified personnel, control costs and maintain asset quality, this continued rapid growth could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nRisks Related to Mid Penn Common Stock\nThe trading volume in Mid Penn\u2019s common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\nMid Penn\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ (symbol: MPB); however, the trading volume in its common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of Mid Penn\u2019s common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which Mid Penn has no control. Given the generally lower trading volume of Mid Penn\u2019s common stock, significant sales of Mid Penn\u2019s common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause Mid Penn\u2019s stock price to fall.\nThe market price of Mid Penn common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for investors to resell shares of common stock owned by them at times or at prices they find attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock as reported on NASDAQ is subject to constant change during business trading hours. We expect that the market price of Mid Penn common stock will continue to fluctuate and there can be no assurance about the stability or trend of market prices for Mid Penn common stock. Stock price volatility, particularly with a stock like ours with lower trading volumes than larger financial services companies, may make it difficult for investors to resell their Mid Penn common stock when they want and at times or prices that they find attractive. Mid Penn\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include those described elsewhere in this entire \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, in this document, and our other filings with the SEC.\nMid Penn\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock, and principal and interest on its subordinated notes, depends primarily on dividends from its banking subsidiary, which is subject to regulatory limits.\nMid Penn is a bank holding company and its operations are conducted primarily by its banking subsidiary. Mid Penn\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock, and principal and interest on its subordinated notes, depends on its receipt of dividends from the Bank. Dividend payments from its banking subsidiary are subject to legal and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits and retained earnings, imposed by the respective regulatory agencies that supervise the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is also subject to profitability, financial condition, liquidity, and capital management limits. There is no assurance that Mid Penn\u2019s banking subsidiary or other subsidiaries established in the future will be able to pay dividends, or that Mid Penn itself will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends in the future. Federal Reserve policy, which applies to Mid Penn as a registered bank holding company, also provides that dividends by bank holding companies should generally be paid out of earnings from both the current period and a designated look-back period. Mid Penn\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock, or the amount of any dividends paid, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock.\nMid Penn may need to, or be required to, raise additional capital in the future, and capital may not be available when needed and on terms favorable to current stockholders.\nFederal banking regulators require Mid Penn\u2019s holding company and the Bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations. These capital levels are determined and dictated by law, regulation, and banking regulatory agencies. In addition, capital levels are also determined by Mid Penn\u2019s management and board of directors, based on capital levels that they believe are necessary to support Mid Penn\u2019s business operations.\nIf Mid Penn raises capital through merger and acquisition activities, or through the issuance of additional shares of its common stock or other securities, it would likely dilute the ownership interests of current investors and could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of its common stock. Furthermore, a capital raise through issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on Mid Penn\u2019s stock price. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to Mid Penn\u2019s current common stockholders, which may adversely impact its current common stockholders.\nMid Penn\u2019s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of its control, and on its financial performance. Accordingly, Mid Penn cannot be certain of its ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms and acceptable time frames or to raise additional capital at all. If Mid Penn cannot raise additional capital in sufficient amounts when needed, its ability to comply with regulatory capital requirements could be materially impaired. Additionally, the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect Mid Penn\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.\nOfferings of debt, which would be senior to Mid Penn\u2019s common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nMid Penn may attempt to increase its capital resources if the Corporation\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s capital ratios fall below the required minimums. Mid Penn\u2019s holding company or the Bank could be required to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock. If a future liquidation of Mid Penn occurs, holders of debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings are likely to receive distributions of available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Holders of Mid Penn common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.\nAlso, Mid Penn\u2019s board of directors is authorized to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of the shareholders. The board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over common stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding up and liquidation and other terms. If Mid Penn issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if preferred stock is issued with voting rights that dilute the voting power of common stock, the rights of holders of Mid Penn\u2019s common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected.\nPennsylvania Business Corporation Law and various anti-takeover provisions under our articles of incorporation and bylaws could impede the takeover of Mid Penn.\nVarious Pennsylvania laws affecting business corporations may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire Mid Penn, even if the acquisition would be advantageous to shareholders. In addition, Mid Penn has various anti-takeover measures in place under its articles of incorporation and bylaws, including a supermajority vote requirement for mergers, the staggered election of Mid Penn\u2019s board of directors, and the absence of cumulative voting. Any one or more of these laws or measures may impede the takeover of Mid Penn and may prevent its shareholders from taking part in a transaction in which they could realize a premium over the current market price of its common stock.\nMid Penn\u2019s common stock is not insured by any governmental entity.\nAlthough Mid Penn and the Bank are regulated by governmental agencies, Mid Penn common stock is not a deposit account or other obligation of the Bank or any other bank and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund, any other governmental entity or by any other public or private entity. Investment in Mid Penn common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, in this document, and our other filings with the SEC. Mid Penn common stock is also subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any other publicly traded company. As a result, investors who acquire Mid Penn common stock may lose some or all of their investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nMid Penn\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement maintains Mid Penn\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures, and periodically reviews and updates them. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on performance by personnel or certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of Mid Penn\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Mid Penn\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMid Penn may not be able to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nMid Penn\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain qualified, key personnel. Competition for the best personnel in most activities engaged in by Mid Penn can be intense, and Mid Penn may not be able to hire or retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of Mid Penn\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on Mid Penn\u2019s business because of their skills, knowledge of Mid Penn\u2019s market, years of industry experience, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nMID PENN BANCORP, INC.", "PERMNO": 85656, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MPB"}
