RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may suffer, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nWe have a history of operating losses and substantial indebtedness. Future cash flows from operations and financings may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, which likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses in recent years and, as of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $74 million. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenue in the future to cover our expenses and achieve profitability on a consistent basis or at all.\nWe have issued various unsecured promissory notes to finance our acquisition of KBS and provide for our general working capital needs. As of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding debt totaling approximately $11.5 million. Our debt included $1.9 million principal amount outstanding under an unsecured promissory note issued to the primary seller of KBS, which amount is payable in monthly installments of $100,000, inclusive of interest, through July 1, 2017. Our debt also included $5.0 million principal amount of promissory notes issued to Lone Star Value Investors, LP (\u201cLSVI\u201d) and $4.5 million principal amount of promissory notes issued to Lone Star Value Co-Invest I, LP (\u201cLSV Co-Invest I\u201d). Interest on these notes is payable semiannually and any unpaid principal and interest is due on April 1, 2019. On February 25, 2016, we repaid a total of $1.0 million principal amount of such indebtedness to LSVI. Jeffrey E. Eberwein, our Chairman of the Board, is the manager of Lone Star Value Investors GP, LLC (\u201cLSVGP\u201d), the general partner of LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I, and sole member of Lone Star Value Management, LLC (\u201cLSVM\u201d), the investment manager of LSVI.\nOn February 23, 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) with Gerber Finance Inc. (\u201cGerber Finance\u201d) providing KBS with a credit facility with borrowing availability of up to $4.0 million, based on a formula tied to eligible accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate of the borrowers. On that date, we made an initial draw of approximately $2.6 million. The borrowers\u2019 obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by all of their property and assets and are guaranteed by the Company. Our obligations under our unsecured promissory notes are subordinate to the borrowers\u2019 obligations under the Loan Agreement, pursuant to the terms of subordination agreements we entered into with Gerber Finance and the holders of our unsecured promissory notes as a condition to the extension of credit to the borrowers under the Loan Agreement.\nWe intend to pursue new financing at the parent level to replace all or a portion of the debt owing to LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I and to provide for our general working capital needs. There can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining such new financing, on terms favorable to us or at all. Until such time as we obtain additional financing, we may be dependent on LSVI and LSV Co-Invest I, or other third parties, to provide for our general working capital needs. Although not a binding commitment, LSVM has advised us of its present intention to continue to financially support the Company as we pursue new financing.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.6 million. There can be no assurance that our cash and cash equivalents, together with funds generated by our operations and any future financings, will be sufficient to satisfy our debt payment obligations. Our inability to generate funds or obtain financing sufficient to satisfy our debt payment obligations may result in such obligations being accelerated by our lenders, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional financing and our ability to obtain such financing may be limited.\nWe may need additional financing in order to satisfy our debt payment obligations and effectively execute our business plan, which may include strategic acquisitions. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional financing, or that if available, it will be available to us on acceptable terms. The Loan Agreement contains negative covenants limiting our ability to obtain additional debt financing without the consent of Gerber Finance. Due to our history of operating losses, existing debt payment obligations and the restrictions under the Loan Agreement, our ability to obtain such additional financing may be limited.\nThe Loan Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nThe Loan Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio at fiscal year end and not to incur a net annual post-tax loss in any fiscal year during the term of the Loan Agreement. These covenants also include restrictions on our abilities to take certain actions without the consent of Gerber Finance, and may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. These restrictions include, among other things, limitations on the ability of the borrowers to take the following actions: merge, consolidate, acquire or invest in another company; incur additional debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; engage in other businesses; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets; and make certain payments, including dividends or distributions to ATRM.\nThere can be no assurances as to the amount of earn-out payments we will receive from the transfer of our test handler product line to Boston Semi Automation LLC.\nOn April 22, 2014, we entered into an Agreement (the \u201cBSA Agreement\u201d) with Boston Semi Equipment LLC (\u201cBSE\u201d) and Boston Semi Automation LLC (\u201cBSA\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of BSE, pursuant to which we transferred our assets and certain liabilities related to our business of designing, manufacturing, marketing and servicing equipment used in the handling of integrated circuits (\u201ctest handler product line\u201d) to BSA. Since such date, our ability to generate revenue from the transferred business is limited to the earn-out payments we will receive under the terms of the BSA Agreement. Under the terms of the BSA Agreement, no earn-out payments will be earned after December 31, 2018. There can be no assurances of BSA\u2019s ability to generate revenue from the transferred business or of the amount of earn-outs that we will receive under such agreement.\nWe are dependent on our senior management team and other key employees.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on our senior management team and other key employees and the ability of other personnel or new hires to effectively replace key employees who may retire or resign. Failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain new leadership and other important personnel could lead to ineffective management and operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe cyclical and seasonal nature of the modular housing industry causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in the future.\nThe modular housing industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many national and regional economic and demographic factors, including the availability of financing for homebuyers and developers, consumer confidence, interest rates, demographic and employment trends, income levels, housing demand, general economic conditions (including inflation and recessions), and the availability of suitable home sites. As a result of the foregoing economic, demographic, and other factors, our revenues and operating results have been volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. Unfavorable changes in any of the above factors or other issues could have an adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the cost and availability of raw materials.\nPrices and availability of raw materials used to manufacture our products can change significantly due to fluctuations in supply and demand. Additionally, availability of the raw materials used to manufacture our products may be limited at times resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials may also be influenced by transportation costs. It is not certain that any price increases can be passed on to our customers without affecting demand or that limited availability of materials will not impact our production capabilities. The state of the financial and housing markets may also impact our suppliers and affect the availability or pricing of materials. Our inability to raise the price of our products in response to increases in prices of raw materials or to maintain a proper supply of raw materials could have an adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.\nWe have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2015.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2015 due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to inadequate accounting processes and internal control procedures. Our failure to successfully remediate these material weaknesses could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and to produce timely and reliable financial information. Additionally, such failure could cause investors to lose confidence in our public disclosures, which could have a negative impact on our stock price. For a discussion of these material weaknesses and our remediation efforts, please see Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have a few customers that account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of these customers, or decrease in their demand for our products, could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial percentage of our net sales and accounts receivable. One customer, a general contractor for commercial construction in the New England area, accounted for 15% and 17% of our total net sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Two other customers, each of which is also a general contractor for commercial construction in the New England area, accounted for 22% and 11%, respectively, of our total net sales in 2014. A reduction, delay, or cancellation of orders from one or more of these significant customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, would likely have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain or establish relationships with independent dealers and contractors who sell our homes, our revenue could decline.\nWe sell residential homes through a network of independent dealers and contractors. As is common in the industry, our independent dealers may also sell homes produced by competing manufacturers and can cancel their relationships with us on short notice. In addition, these dealers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic and seasonal trends similar to those faced by us. If we are not able to maintain good relationships with our dealers and contractors or establish relationships with new solvent dealers or contractors, our revenue could decline.\nDue to the nature of our business, many of our expenses are fixed costs and if there are decreases in demand for our products, it may adversely affect our operating results.\nMany of our expenses, particularly those relating to properties, capital equipment, and certain manufacturing overhead items, are fixed in the short term. Reduced demand for our products causes our fixed production costs to be allocated across reduced production volumes, which adversely affects our gross margins and profitability.\nCertain actions taken in connection with reducing operating costs may have a negative impact on our business.\nIn the event of a housing downturn and a decline in our revenues, we may implement cost reduction actions such as temporary factory shutdowns, workforce reductions, pay freezes and reductions, and reductions in other expenditures. In doing so, we will attempt to maintain the necessary infrastructures to allow us to take full advantage of subsequent improvements in market conditions. However, there can be no assurance that reductions we may make in personnel and expenditure levels and the loss of the capabilities of personnel we have terminated or may terminate will not inhibit us in the timely ramp up of production in response to improving market conditions.\nDue to the nature of the work we perform, we may be subject to significant liability claims and disputes.\nWe engage in services that can result in substantial injury or damages that may expose us to legal proceedings, investigations and disputes. For example, in the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal disputes regarding personal injury and wrongful death claims, employee or labor disputes, professional liability claims, and general commercial disputes, as well as other claims. An unfavorable legal ruling against us could result in substantial monetary damages. Although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management, safety, and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, there can be no assurance that such programs will protect us fully from all risks and liabilities. If we sustain liabilities that exceed our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nThere is a limited market for our common stock.\nThere is a limited public market for our common stock. The average daily trading volume in our common stock during the fiscal year 2015 was approximately 3,500 shares per day. Our common stock was removed from listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market and began trading on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. in October 2015, which may limit the liquidity and price of our common stock more than if our common stock were listed on NASDAQ or another national exchange. We cannot provide assurances that a more active trading market will develop or be sustained. As a result of low trading volume in our common stock, the purchase or sale of a relatively small number of securities could result in significant price fluctuations and it may be difficult for holders to sell their securities without depressing the market price for such securities.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. income tax purposes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $91 million and state NOLs of approximately $31 million. Our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods and whether we become subject to annual limitations on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by our NOLs.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by a corporation\u2019s NOLs if the corporation experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when the corporation\u2019s \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the corporation by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Additionally, various states have similar limitations on the use of state NOLs following an ownership change.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation include provisions designed to protect the tax benefits of our NOLs by generally restricting any direct or indirect transfers of our common stock that increase the direct or indirect ownership of our common stock by any person from less than 4.99% to 4.99% or more, or increase the percentage of our common stock owned directly or indirectly by a person owning or deemed to own 4.99% or more of our common stock. Any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of these transfer restrictions will be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee. Additionally, we have adopted and our shareholders have approved a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan that generally is designed to deter any person from acquiring shares of our common stock if the acquisition would result in such person beneficially owning 4.99% or more of our common stock without the approval of our Board.\nAlthough these measures are intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change, we cannot assure you that they will prevent all transfers of our common stock that could result in such an ownership change. Further, these measures could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, ATRM or a large block of our common stock, which may adversely affect the marketability, and depress the market price, of our common stock. In addition, these provisions could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our shareholders.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership may limit individual stockholder ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of March 28, 2016, Jeffrey E. Eberwein, our Chairman of the Board, may be deemed to beneficially own 1,087,885 shares of our common stock, including 1,067,885 shares of our common stock owned directly by LSVI, constituting approximately 48% of our outstanding shares. As a result, Mr. Eberwein and LSVI are able to exercise significant influence with respect to all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, they will exercise significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other business combination or reorganization. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of us on terms that other stockholders may desire. The interests of such stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders, and such stockholders may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, and might affect the prevailing market price for our securities.", "PERMNO": 79472, "SIC": 1520, "TIC": "ATRM"}
