{"cik": "1408100", "company": "Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by numerous risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and future prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and in the risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and the real estate industry, and, accordingly, our business could be harmed by an economic slowdown and downturn in real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities.\nOur business is closely tied to general economic conditions in the real estate industry. As a result, our economic performance, the value of our real estate and our ability to implement our business strategies may be significantly and adversely affected by changes in national and local economic conditions. The condition of the real estate markets in which we operate is cyclical and depends on the condition of the economy in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, and to a lesser extent, Spain and Italy as a whole and to the perceptions of investors of the overall economic outlook. Rising interest rates, declining employment levels, declining demand for real estate, declining real estate values, periods of general economic slowdown, or recession or the perception that any of these events may occur have negatively impacted the real estate market in the past and may in the future negatively impact our operating performance. The economic condition of each local market where we operate may depend on one or more key industries within that market, which, in turn, makes our business sensitive to the performance of those industries. We have only a limited ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. Certain significant expenditures, such as debt service costs, real estate taxes, and operating and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when market conditions are poor. These factors impede us from responding quickly to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have experienced in past years and expect in the future to be negatively impacted by, periods of economic slowdown or recession, and corresponding declines in the demand for real estate and related services, within the markets in which we operate. Previous recessions and downturns in the real estate market have resulted in and may result in:\n\u2022a general decline in rents due to defaulting tenants or less favorable terms for renewed or new leases;\n\u2022a decline in actual and projected sale prices of our properties, resulting in lower returns on the properties in which we have invested;\n\u2022higher interest rates, higher loan costs, less desirable loan terms and a reduction in the availability of mortgage loans, all of which could increase costs and limit our ability to acquire additional real estate assets; and\n\u2022a decrease in the availability of lines of credit and the capital markets and other sources of capital used to operate and maintain our business.\nIf our business performance and profitability deteriorate, we could fail to comply with certain financial covenants in our unsecured revolving credit facilities, which would force us to seek an amendment with our lenders. We may be unable to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments on satisfactory terms, if at all, which could result in the principal and interest of the debt to become immediately due. Please also see \u201cOur debt obligations impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions.\u201d In addition, in an extreme deterioration of our business, we could have insufficient liquidity to meet our debt service obligations when they come due in future years or maintain our common stock or preferred stock dividends.\nOur business and those of our tenants may be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks.\nEpidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus (including COVID-19) that affect countries or regions in which our tenants or their parent companies, as applicable, operate or in which our properties or corporate offices are located, and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, may have a material and adverse impact on general commercial activity, the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and our ability to lease properties on favorable terms and/or collect owed rents on a timely basis or at all. In addition, numerous state, local, federal and industry-initiated efforts may also affect our ability to collect rent and enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent, including eviction moratoriums. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus could also cause the on-site employees of our tenants to avoid our properties, which could adversely affect our tenants\u2019 ability to adequately manage their businesses. Risks related to epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus could also lead to the complete or partial closure of one or more of our tenants\u2019 distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in our tenants\u2019 supply chains from local and international suppliers and/or delays in the delivery of our tenants\u2019 inventory. Such events could adversely impact our tenants\u2019 sales and/or cause the temporary closure of our tenants\u2019 businesses, which could severely disrupt their operations and the rental revenue we generate from our leases with them.\nThe profitability of our office and industrial/retail portfolio (which makes up 4.8 million square feet and 3.8 million square feet, respectively, of our total commercial portfolio) depends, in part, on the willingness and ability of customers to visit our tenants' businesses and demand for office space. The risk, public perception of the risk and measures taken to limit the impact of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus, (including COVID-19), including social distancing and other restrictions, could adversely impact tenant\u2019s sales and/or cause the temporary closure or slowdown of our tenants' businesses, which could severely disrupt their operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, which may impact our ability to collect owed rents on a timely basis or at all. Additionally, the physical occupancy of our office properties remains well below capacity as most employers continue their COVID-19 pandemic response protocols and encourage employees to work from home when possible during the pandemic. The short and long term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of office space is unknown as companies continue to consider the pandemic\u2019s impact on their business and their demand for labor, while, at the same time, considering the space requirements associated with social distancing and the practical implications of pivoting to a work from home environment. A decrease in demand for office space from our current or prospective tenants could adversely affect the profitability of our office and retail portfolio.\nThe profitability of our hotel properties (which consists of one consolidated hotel and one Co-Investment held within a commingled fund) depends, in part, on the willingness and ability of customers to visit these properties The risk, public perception of the risk and measures taken to limit the impact of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus, (including COVID-19), including social distancing measures and travel and other restrictions, could result in a sustained, significant drop in demand for our hotels. The interference with the operations of our hotel properties, including the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin, resulted in significantly less levels of Net Operating Income from these properties in 2020 compared to prior years. It is not currently known when the operations at our hotel properties will resume or when business levels will return to normalized levels, if at all, when the effects of the pandemic subside. There can also be no guarantee that the demand for lodging, and consumer confidence in travel generally, will recover as quickly as other industries.\nMoreover, as of December 31, 2020, we hold investments in 29,841 multifamily apartment units across 116 assets primarily located in the Western United States and Ireland. Our Western U.S. multifamily assets are primarily located in the Pacific Northwest, mostly in suburbs of Seattle and Portland and the Mountain States region of Utah, Idaho, Montana and Nevada. The rest of the Western U.S. portfolio is in Northern and Southern California. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus could cause our tenants to fail to make rent payments, limit our ability to increase rents or otherwise affect our leases with them and/or cause us to make rent concessions.\nAdditionally, we engage in development activities and, from time to time, acquire development assets to the extent attractive projects become available in various locations across the globe. In many cases, these development activities are significant and limit or entirely eliminate our ability to lease the related assets until the development is substantially completed. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness may also delay our development activities and increase construction and carrying costs relating to development projects, among other things.\nThrough our debt platforms, we also pursue first-mortgage loans secured by high-quality real estate in the Western U.S., Ireland and the U.K. and stabilized, income producing, high-quality real estate investment opportunities in the Western U.S. that may include the origination or acquisition of mezzanine loans, construction loans, preferred equity investments and other types of investments. Epidemics, pandemics or other health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread, could adversely affect the businesses and financial condition of our counterparties, including our equity partners, borrowers under our first-mortgage loans, construction loans and mezzanine loans, companies in which we and our equity partners have invested in, and general contractors and their subcontractors, and their ability to satisfy their obligations to borrowers of our construction loans and to complete transactions or projects with borrowers of our construction loans as intended. In addition, a significant number of retail tenants have been forced to temporarily close or operate on a limited basis as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, which has resulted in, and could continue to result in, delays in rent payments, rent concessions, early lease terminations or tenant bankruptcies, and which in turn could adversely affect our borrowers\u2019 ability to service our loans or a company\u2019s ability to pay us dividends on the preferred stock we hold in such company. All of the above listed risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. See \u201cOur real estate development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful.\u201d below.\nEpidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of illness, disease or virus (including COVID-19) has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in the financial markets and the overall global economy. This slowdown could impact our ability to complete opportunistic and/or planned acquisitions or dispositions of property. Lower levels of transactional activity can also mean lower gains on sales that may have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could impact our future compliance with operational and financial debt covenants contained in the agreements that govern the Second A&R Facility, the recently issued 4.750% Senior Notes due 2029 (the \"2029 Notes\") and 5.000% Senior Notes due 2031 (the \"2031 Notes\") by Kennedy-Wilson, Inc., Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.'s 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\" and, together with the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, the \"KWI Notes\") the KWE Notes, the KWE Bonds and certain of our property-level non-recourse financings. Our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in a foreclosure on the underlying assets. In addition, certain of our debt instruments also contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, including, but not limited to, the documents governing our KWI Notes, the KWE Notes and the KWE Bonds. Please also see \u201cWe have in the past incurred and may continue in the future to incur significant amounts of debt and, to a lesser extent, preferred stock, to finance acquisitions, which could negatively affect our cash flows and subject our properties or other assets to the risk of foreclosure.\u201d\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and could continue to cause, substantial disruption to our employees due to the implementation of restrictions by federal, state and local authorities to slow the spread of COVID-19, including self-isolation, travel limitations and business restrictions, among other things, which could result in significant disruptions to our business operations. Although most of our employees are able to work remotely, there can be no assurance that we will adequately mitigate the risks of business disruptions and interruptions due to cyber security and data accessibility or communications issues as a result of our employees working remotely, which could adversely impact our business operations. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and such adverse impacts may be material.\nThe ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak of an illness, disease or virus on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, among others. These and other potential impacts of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nAdverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe credit markets may experience significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions. These circumstances may materially impact liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and, in some cases, unavailable, even for companies that are otherwise qualified to obtain financing. Volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for our capital needs. Additionally, due to\nthis uncertainty, we may be unable to refinance or extend our existing debt on favorable terms, if at all. A prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan. Additionally, disruptions in the credit markets may also adversely affect our business of providing investment management services to our limited partners in our commingled funds and joint venture partners, which would lead to a decrease in the fee revenue we generate.\nWe could lose part or all of our investments in real estate assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is the inherent possibility in all of our real estate investments that we could lose all or part of our investment. Real estate investments are generally illiquid, which may affect our ability to change our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions. Moreover, we may not be able to unilaterally decide the timing of the disposition of an investment under certain joint venture arrangements, and as a result, we may not control when and whether any gain will be realized, or loss avoided. The value of our investments can also be diminished by:\n\u2022civil unrest, acts of war and terrorism, pandemics and acts of God, including earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions and other natural disasters (which may result in uninsured or under insured losses);\n\u2022the impact of present or future legislation in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, and to a lesser extent, Spain and Italy (including, without limitation, rent-control legislation, environmental regulation, changes in laws concerning foreign investments, changes in tax rates, tariff regimes and changes in zoning laws) and the cost of compliance with these types of legislation; and\n\u2022liabilities relating to claims, to the extent insurance is not available or is inadequate.\nOur real estate development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful.\nWe acquire development assets to the extent attractive projects become available. When we engage in development activities, we are subject to risks associated with those activities that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the market price of, our common stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations;\n\u2022we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects, or obtain financing on favorable terms;\n\u2022construction costs of a project may exceed the original estimates or construction may not be concluded on schedule, making the project less profitable than originally estimated or not profitable at all (including the possibility of errors or omissions in the project's design, contract default, contractor or subcontractor default, performance bond surety default, the effects of local weather conditions, natural disasters and pandemics, the possibility of local or national strikes and the possibility of shortages in materials, building supplies or energy and fuel for equipment);\n\u2022tenants which pre-lease space or contract with us for a build-to-suit project may default prior to occupying the project;\n\u2022upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain, or obtain on advantageous terms, permanent financing for activities that we financed through construction loans;\n\u2022we may not achieve sufficient occupancy levels, sales levels and/or obtain sufficient rents to ensure the profitability of a completed project; and\n\u2022development projects in which we have invested may be abandoned and the related investment will be impaired.\nMoreover, substantial renovation and development activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention, diverting their attention from our other operations.\nFurthermore, part of our investment strategy is to locate and acquire real estate assets that we believe are undervalued and to improve them to increase their resale value. Acquiring properties that are not yet fully developed or in need of substantial renovation or redevelopment entails several risks, particularly the risk that we overestimate the value of the property or that the cost or time to complete the renovation or redevelopment will exceed the budgeted amount. Any failure to complete a redevelopment project in a timely manner and within budget or to sell or lease the project after completion could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nOur significant operations in the United Kingdom and Ireland and to a lesser extent, Spain and Italy expose our business to risks inherent in conducting business in foreign markets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 39% of our revenues were sourced from our foreign operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and Italy, 91% of which was sourced from our operations in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Accordingly, our firm-wide results of operations depend significantly on our foreign operations. Conducting business abroad carries significant risks, including:\n\u2022restrictions and problems relating to the repatriation of capital;\n\u2022global pandemics and the different impact of such pandemic on each country and different response to the same by governments\n\u2022difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws;\n\u2022laws restricting foreign companies from conducting business;\n\u2022political instability and civil unrest;\n\u2022greater difficulty in perfecting our security interests, collecting accounts receivable, foreclosing on secured assets and protecting our interests as a creditor in bankruptcies in certain geographic regions;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022share ownership restrictions on foreign operations; and\n\u2022tariff regimes of the countries in which we do business.\nPoor performance of our commingled funds would cause a decline in our revenue and results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future funds.\nWhen any of our commingled closed-end funds perform poorly, our investment record suffers. As a result, our management and performance fees and our ability to raise additional capital from our partners may be adversely affected. If a fund performs poorly, we will receive little or no performance fees with regard to the fund and little income or possibly losses from our own principal investment in such fund. As the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, if we were to have negative performance in a period that causes the amount due to us to be less than the amount previously recognized as revenue, this could result in a negative adjustment to performance fees allocated to the general partner or asset manager. Our fund investors and potential fund investors continually assess our funds' performance independently and relative to market benchmarks and our competitors, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future funds depends on our funds' performance. Alternatively, in the face of poor fund performance, investors could demand lower fees or significant fee concessions for existing or future funds which would likewise decrease our revenue or decide not to invest with us.\nOur joint venture activities subject us to third-party risks, including risks that other participants may become bankrupt or take action contrary to our best interests.\nWe have used joint ventures for large real estate investments and developments. We plan to continue to acquire interests in additional joint ventures formed to own or develop real property or interests in real property. We have acquired and may acquire non-controlling interests in joint ventures, and we may, from time-to-time, also acquire interests as a passive investor without rights to actively participate in the management of the joint ventures. Investments in joint ventures involve additional risks, including the possibility that the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, that we will not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and that other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives. Should a participant in a material joint venture investment act contrary to our interests, our business, results of operations and financial condition could significantly suffer. Moreover, we cannot be certain that we will continue to identify suitable joint venture partners and form new joint ventures in the future.\nIf we are unable to identify, acquire and integrate suitable investment opportunities and acquisition targets, our future growth will be impeded.\nAcquisitions and expansion have been, and will continue to be, a significant component of our growth strategy. While maintaining our existing business lines, we intend to continue to pursue a sustained growth strategy by increasing revenues from seeking selective investment and co-investment opportunities and pursuing strategic acquisitions. Our ability to manage our growth will require us to effectively integrate new acquisitions into our existing operations while managing development of principal properties. We expect that significant growth in several business lines occurring simultaneously will place substantial demands on our managerial, administrative, operational and financial resources. We may be unable to successfully manage all factors necessary for a successful expansion of our business. Moreover, our strategy of growth depends on the existence of and our ability to identify attractive investment opportunities and synergistic acquisition targets. The unavailability of suitable investment opportunities and acquisition targets, or our inability to find or be successful in competing for them, may result in a decline in business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe own real estate properties located in Hawaii, which subjects us to unique risks relating to, among other things, Hawaii\u2019s economic dependence on fluctuating tourism, the isolated location of Hawaii and the potential for natural disasters.\nWe conduct operations and own properties in Hawaii. The gross asset value of our investments in Hawaii is $326.1 million and $278.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The success of our investments in Hawaii depends on and is affected by general trends in Hawaii\u2019s economy and real estate market. Hawaii\u2019s economy largely depends on tourism, which is subject to fluctuation based on a number of factors that we do not control. In addition, Hawaii has historically been vulnerable to certain natural disaster risks, such as tsunamis, volcanoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, which could cause damage to properties owned by us or property values to decline in general.\nOur three largest investments in Hawaii are a hotel development project on the Big Island and two residential assets (one located on the Big Island and the other located on the island of Oahu) as discussed in our description of our residential and development and redevelopment investments in Item 1 - \u201cBusiness\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K. Please also see the section titled \"Industry Overview - Hawaii\" in Item 1 of this annual report on form 10-K. In addition to the general risks with respect to development and redevelopment projects as discussed above, Hawaii\u2019s remote and isolated location may create additional operational costs and expenses (general operating and development-related costs), which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. If any or all of the factors discussed above were to occur and result in our inability or materially limit our ability to sell or lease our residential and commercial properties, a significant delay in or a significant increase costs to complete our development assets, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur real estate debt investment business operates in a highly competitive market for lending and investment opportunities through our debt platforms, including originating and investing in senior loans, mezzanine loans, B- and C-Notes and preferred equity, which may limit our ability to originate or acquire desirable loans and investments in our target assets and are subject to increased risks.\nOur real estate debt investment business (\u201cDebt Platform\u201d) operates in a highly competitive market for lending and investment opportunities. A number of entities compete with us to make the types of loans and investments that we seek to make, including originating and investing in senior loans, mezzanine loans, B-and C-Notes and preferred equity. The profitability of our debt platform depends, in large part, on our ability to originate or acquire target assets at attractive prices for ourselves and our partners. In addition, some of our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. Furthermore, competition for originations of, and investments in, our target assets may lead to the yield of such assets decreasing, which may further limit our ability to generate desired returns for ourselves and our partners. Also, as a result of this competition, desirable loans and investments in specific types of target assets may be limited in the future.\nIn addition to originating and acquiring senior loans, we also originate and invest in mezzanine loans, B-and C-Notes and preferred equity and these types of investments generally involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property. For example, if a borrower defaults, there may not be sufficient funds remaining for a B-Note holder after payment to the A-Note holder. Similarly, if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt and may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. Further, preferred equity investments involve a higher degree of risk than conventional debt financing due to a variety of factors, including their non-collateralized nature and subordinated ranking to other loans and liabilities of the entity in which such preferred equity is held. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our investment. Significant losses related to our mezzanine loans, B-Notes or preferred equity interests would result in operating losses for us and our partners. In addition, in the event a borrower defaults on a loan, there is no guarantee or assurance that we will be able to successfully foreclose and take control of the underlying collateral (to the extent available).\nAny distressed loans and loan portfolios that we may purchase, or investments that may become \"sub-performing\" or \"non-performing\" following our origination or acquisition thereof, may have a higher risk of default and delinquencies than newly originated loans, and, as a result, we may lose part or all of our investment in such loans and loan portfolios.\nWhile our loans and investments focus primarily on \"performing\" real estate-related interests, our loans and investments may also include making distressed investments from time to time (e.g., investments in defaulted, out-of-favor or distressed loans and debt securities) or may involve loans and loan portfolios in some cases that may be non-performing or sub-performing and may be in default at the time of purchase or may become \"sub-performing\" or \"non-performing\" following our origination or acquisition thereof. In general, the distressed loans and loan portfolios we may acquire are speculative investments and have a greater than normal risk of future defaults and delinquencies as compared to newly originated loans.\nReturns on loan investments depend on the borrower\u2019s ability to make required payments or, in the event of default, our security interests and our ability to foreclose and liquidate whatever property that secures the loans and loan portfolios. We may be unable to collect on a defaulted loan or foreclose on security successfully or in a timely fashion. There may also be instances when we are able to acquire title to an underlying property and sell it but not make a profit on its investment.\nIn addition, in the event of a decline in real estate values, the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our cost on the loan significantly increases.\nOur reliance on third-parties to operate certain of our properties may harm our business.\nWe rely on third party property managers and hotel operators to manage the daily operations of our properties. These third parties are directly responsible for the day-to-day operation of our properties with limited supervision by us, and they often have potentially significant decision-making authority with respect to those properties. Thus, the success of our business may depend in large part on the ability of our third-party property managers to manage the day-to-day operations, and any adversity experienced by our property managers could adversely impact the operation and profitability of our properties\nThese third parties may fail to manage our properties effectively or in accordance with their agreements with us, may be negligent in their performance and may engage in criminal or fraudulent activity. If any of these events occur, we could incur losses or face liabilities from the loss or injury to our property or to persons at our properties. In addition, disputes may arise between us and these third-party managers and operators, and we may incur significant expenses to resolve those disputes or terminate the relevant agreement with these third parties and locate and engage competent and cost-effective service providers to operate and manage the relevant properties.\nWe are also parties to hotel management agreements under which unaffiliated third-party property managers manage our hotels. In addition, from time to time, disputes may arise between us and our third-party managers regarding their performance or compliance with the terms of the hotel management agreements, which in turn could adversely affect us, including damage to our relationships with such franchisers or we may be in breach of our franchise agreement. If we are unable to resolve such disputes through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to terminate our management agreement, litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third party dispute resolution, the expense and outcome of which may harm our business, operating results or prospects.\nOur leasing activities depend on various factors, including tenant occupancy and rental rates, which, if adversely affected, could cause our operating results to suffer.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to promptly find suitable tenants for substantial amounts of vacant space at our properties, if rental rates on new or renewal leases are significantly lower than expected, or if reserves for costs of re-leasing prove inadequate.\nOur ability to lease properties also depends on:\n\u2022the attractiveness of our properties to tenants;\n\u2022competition from other available space;\n\u2022our ability to provide adequate maintenance and obtain insurance and to pay increased operating expenses, which may not be passed through to tenants; and\n\u2022the availability of capital to periodically renovate, repair and maintain the properties, as well as for other operating expenses\n.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nAlthough we are headquartered in the United States, we have worldwide operations and significant business operations in Europe. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 46% of our consolidated investment account represented investments in European properties or assets, 67% of which represents investments in the United Kingdom.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum on its membership of the European Union and the UK formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. Transitional arrangements applied until the end of 2020 and a trade agreement (the \u201cEU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d or \u201cTCA\u201d) was entered into by the UK and the EU and is currently in force.\nDespite the TCA, the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union has fundamentally changed and there is still uncertainty about the impact of the new arrangements. Given the size and importance of the United Kingdom\u2019s economy, uncertainty or unpredictability about its legal, political and economic relationship with the European Union, will be a source of instability, may create significant currency fluctuations, and otherwise adversely affect international markets, trading or other arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future. Any business that depends on the free movement of goods or the provision of cross-border services between the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area (as currently constituted) could be adversely affected. The inability to provide cross-border services, restrictions on movements of employees, non-tariff barriers on goods, potential tariffs being imposed either due to \u201crules of origin\u201d or non-compliance with the aspects of the TCA, increased transit times, and other factors, all have the potential to materially impair the profitability of a business. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility, which may harm our financial position and results of operations. For example, downward pressure on the value of foreign exchange rates could depress our reported earnings from European operations, which are presented on our financial statements in U.S. dollars. Asset valuation reductions could result in write-downs of our consolidated European assets and reduced proceeds from asset sales. In addition, any negative impact on European financial markets could harm our ability to raise capital efficiently in those markets when needed to execute our acquisition and value-add business plans, which would in turn adversely affect our reported results of operations.\nThe developments resulting from the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union could have a particularly adverse effect on the real estate market in the United Kingdom and surrounding areas, where a significant portion of our consolidated real estate investments are located. Deteriorating economic conditions could depress the demand for real estate space, which, in turn, could increase vacancies and depress lease rates, leading to a further reduction in real estate property values. Any of these events could cause our real estate investments in these areas to underperform, which would reduce our operating results and harm our business. In particular, because the timing and negotiation of any new or modified arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union is uncertain, we cannot predict when, if at all, any of these risks could materialize or the magnitude of their effect on our European operations.\nAdditionally, any decision of another member state to withdraw from the European Union could exacerbate such uncertainty and instability and may present similar and/or additional potential risks. Any of these factors or risks discussed herein could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. Regardless of the industry, investors\u2019 increased focus related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company\u2019s ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have adopted certain practices and policies to align our ESG approach with our business strategy by maximizing the inherent value of our assets and delivering long-term social, environmental and economic values across our portfolio. However, our stakeholders may look to us to implement more or different ESG procedures, standards or goals in order to continue engaging with us, to remain invested in us, or before they make further investments in us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event our ESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies or such constituencies might not be satisfied with our efforts or the speed of adoption of ESG practices or polices. If we do not meet our stakeholders\u2019 expectations or we are not effective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, trust in our brand may suffer and our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks.\nRent control or rent stabilization legislation and other regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to increase rents and pass through new or increased operating costs to our tenants.\nWe presently expect to continue operating and acquiring properties in areas that have adopted laws and regulations imposing restrictions on the timing or amount of rent increases. The state of California has implemented a statewide rent control imitative that limits rental increases to 5% + the consumer price index (CPI). The state of Oregon has also implemented a statewide rent control program that caps annual increases to 7% + CPI with the city of Portland, Oregon limiting increases to 9.2%. In addition to the statewide rent control programs, various municipalities, including certain cities where our properties are located, have enacted rent control or rent stabilization legislation. Furthermore, enactment of similar regulations have been and are being considered in other jurisdictions where we hold investments. Although, we are able to increase rents to market rates once a tenant vacates a rent-controlled or stabilized unit, increases in rental rates for renewing tenants are limited by such regulations.\nSimilarly, under current Irish law, for rent controlled properties we are restricted from increasing rents to market rates for renewing tenants or replacement tenants, and any rent increases in these circumstances are generally capped, save in certain limited circumstances. These laws and regulations can (i) limit our ability to charge market rents, increase rents, evict tenants or recover increases in our operating expenses, (ii) negatively impact our ability to attract higher-paying tenants, (iii) require us to expend money for reporting and compliance, and (iv) make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances. Any failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines and/or other penalties.\nWe may be subject to potential environmental liability.\nUnder various foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances and may be liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by governmental entities or third parties in connection with the contamination. Such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances, even when the contaminants were associated with previous owners or operators. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to properly remediate those substances, may adversely affect the owner\u2019s or operator\u2019s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral. The presence of contamination at a property can impair the value of the property even if the contamination is migrating onto the property from an adjoining property. Additionally, the owner of a site may be subject to claims by parties who have no relation to the property based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site. In connection with the direct or indirect ownership, operation, management and development of real properties, we may be considered an owner or operator of those properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. Therefore, we may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs.\nBefore consummating the acquisition of a particular piece of real property, it is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct an environmental review of the real property, including performing a Phase I environmental review. These assessments have included, among other things, a visual inspection of the real properties and the surrounding area and a review of relevant federal, state and historical documents. It is possible that the assessments we commission do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are currently unaware. Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability and the current environmental condition of our properties may be affected by tenants, by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of those properties, or by unrelated third parties. Federal, state, local and foreign agencies or private plaintiffs may bring actions against us in the future, and those actions, if adversely resolved, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs complying with laws, regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties and operations.\nThe properties in our portfolio and our operations are subject to various covenants and federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulatory requirements, including permitting and licensing requirements. Such laws and regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers, may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties, including prior to acquiring a property or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties. Among other things, these restrictions may relate to fire and safety, seismic, asbestos-cleanup, hazardous material abatement requirements or accessibility of our properties, such as those required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Existing laws and regulations may adversely affect us, the timing or cost of our future acquisitions or renovations may be uncertain, and additional regulations may be adopted that increase such delays or result in additional costs. Our failure to obtain required permits, licenses and zoning relief or to comply with applicable laws could, among other things, result in monetary fines, private litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur property insurance coverage is limited, and any uninsured losses could cause us to lose part or all of our investment in our insured properties.\nWe carry commercial general liability coverage and umbrella coverage on all of our properties with limits of liability that we deem adequate and appropriate under the circumstances (certain policies subject to deductibles) to insure against liability claims and provide for the cost of legal defense. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses that either may be uninsurable or are not generally insured because it is not economically feasible to insure against those losses. Should any uninsured loss occur, we could lose our investment in, and anticipated revenues from, a property, and these losses could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Currently, we also insure some of our properties for loss caused by earthquakes in levels we deem appropriate and, where we believe necessary, for loss caused by flood. The occurrence of an earthquake, flood or other natural disaster may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise.\nWe face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems. These risks include operational interruption, private data exposure and damage to our relationship with our customers, among others. A security breach involving our networks and related systems could disrupt our operations in numerous ways that could ultimately have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is possible that our business, financial and other systems could be compromised, which might not be noticed for some period of time. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks are evolving and unpredictable. The occurrence of such an attack could lead to financial losses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nIf we are unable to raise additional debt and equity capital, our growth prospects may suffer.\nWe depend on the capital markets to grow our balance sheet along with third-party equity and debt financings to acquire properties through our investment business, which is a key driver of future growth. We currently intend to raise a significant amount of third-party equity and debt to acquire assets in the ordinary course of our business. We depend on debt financing from a combination of financial institutions, the assumption of existing loans, government agencies and seller financing. We depend on equity financing from equity partners, which include public companies, pension funds, family offices, financial institutions, endowments and money managers. Our access to capital funding is uncertain. Our inability to raise additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us could jeopardize the future growth of our business.\nThe loss of one or more key personnel, particularly our CEO, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur continued success depends to a significant degree on the efforts of our senior executives, particularly our chief executive officer, or CEO, who have each been essential to our business. The departure of all or any of our executives for whatever reason or the inability of all or any of them to continue to serve in their present capacities or our inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our executives attract business opportunities and assist both in negotiations with lenders and potential joint venture partners and in the representation of large and institutional clients. If we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, joint venture partners and clients would diminish significantly.\nAs we continue to grow, our success will largely depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of business. We may be unable to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to support or keep pace with our planned growth.\nOur revenues and earnings may be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to our international operations.\nOur revenues from foreign operations have been primarily denominated in the local currency where the associated revenues were earned. Thus, we may experience significant fluctuations in revenues and earnings because of corresponding\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, our foreign currency exposure has been limited to the Pound Sterling and the Euro. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we will be subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we may experience currency losses in the future, and we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future operating results. Our management uses currency hedging instruments from time to time, including foreign currency forward contracts, purchased currency options (where applicable) and foreign currency borrowings. The economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in foreign currency rates, which could lead to hedging losses or the requirement to post collateral, along with unexpected changes in our underlying net asset position. Our hedging activities may not be effective.\nOur results are subject to significant volatility from quarter to quarter due to the varied timing and magnitude of our strategic acquisitions and dispositions, the incurrence of any impairment losses and other transactions.\nWe have experienced a fluctuation in our financial performance from quarter to quarter due in part to the significance of revenues from the sales of real estate on overall performance. The timing of purchases and sales of our real estate investments has varied, and will continue to vary, widely from quarter to quarter due to variability in market opportunities, changes in interest rates, and the overall demand for multifamily and commercial real estate, among other things. While these factors have contributed to our increased operating income and earnings in past years, we may be unable to continue to perform well due to the significant variability in these factors.\nAdditionally, if our future undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. These losses have a direct impact on our net income. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods.\nSome of our portfolio investments may be recorded at fair value, and, as a result, there will be uncertainty as to the value of these investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $1.1 billion, or approximately 88% of our unconsolidated investments and approximately 16% of our total assets, were recorded on our financial statements at estimated fair value. These include our investments in the commingled funds that we manage and unconsolidated investments in which we have elected the fair value option under U.S. generally accepted principles (U.S. GAAP). At the end of each reporting period, the fair value of these investments is recalculated, and any change from the fair value as of the end of the prior reporting period is reflected in our consolidated statement of income as a gain or loss included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments. Accordingly, fair value accounting could result in significant non-cash volatility in our financial position and our results of operation, which, in turn, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and other securities.\nWe generally estimate fair market values using discounted cash flow models that estimate future cash flows (including terminal values) and discount those cash flows back to the current period. Estimating fair values using any valuation methodology is inherently uncertain and involves a significant number of assumptions. Furthermore, any changes in the underlying assumptions for any reason, including capitalization rates, discount rates, liquidity risks, and estimates of future cash flows or as a result of the impact to the global economy due to an epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak of an illness, disease or virus (including COVID-19), including capitalization rates, discount rates, liquidity risks, and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the fair value estimates. For example, small changes in the inputs and assumptions that we use from period to period to estimate these fair values may result in large changes in the carrying value of these investments and could materially and adversely impact our reported earnings. Moreover, the estimated fair values used in preparing our financial statements may not represent amounts that could be realized in a current sale or an immediate settlement of the related asset or liability, nor would those estimated fair values necessarily reflect the returns we may actually realize.\nWe have in the past incurred and may continue in the future to incur significant amounts of debt and, to a lesser extent, preferred stock, to finance acquisitions, which could negatively affect our cash flows and subject our properties or other assets to the risk of foreclosure.\nWe have historically financed new acquisitions with cash derived from secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, preferred stock. For instance, we typically purchase real property with loans secured by a mortgage on the property acquired. We anticipate continuing this trend. We do not have a policy limiting the amount of debt that we may incur. Accordingly, our management and board of directors have discretion to increase the amount of our outstanding debt at any time. We could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service costs that could adversely affect our results of operations and increase the risk of default on debt. We may incur additional debt from time to time to finance\nstrategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement, our debt service obligations may be substantially increased.\nSome of our debt bears interest at variable rates. As a result, we are subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact, adversely or otherwise, results of operations and cash flows. We may be subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risks that:\n\u2022a decrease in the availability of lines of credit and the public equity and debt markets and other sources of capital used to operate and maintain our business;\n\u2022cash flow may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest;\n\u2022existing indebtedness on our properties may not be refinanced and our leverage could increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions, placing us at a disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u2022our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry;\n\u2022our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, results in foreclosure on substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022the terms of available new financing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the obligations owed to any lender with a lien on one of our properties, including the compliance with any operational or financial covenants, the lender could foreclose on the real property or other assets securing the loan and we would lose that property or asset. The loss of any property or asset to foreclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, agreements governing certain of our financings contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, including, without limitation, the indentures governing our 2029 Notes, 2031 Notes, 2024 Notes and the documents governing the Second A&R Facility, the KWE Notes and KWE Bonds. For example, the indenture governing the 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes provide that recourse debt that is not paid within any applicable grace period after final maturity or is accelerated by the applicable lender because of a default and the total amount of such recourse debt unpaid or accelerated exceeds seventy-five million dollars, may constitute a default which could lead to the entire principal amount of the 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes to become immediately due and payable. The documents governing the Second A&R Facility, KWE Notes and KWE Bonds contain similar provisions.\nFrom time to time, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., rate our significant outstanding debt. These ratings and any downgrades thereof may impact our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future, and could increase the interest rates of, and require more onerous terms for, any future borrowings, and could also cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Our earnings may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets at terms that are not attractive, borrow more money or sell more securities, which we may be unable to do, and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur debt obligations impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions.\nOur existing debt obligations impose, and future debt obligations may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022repay indebtedness (including our 2024 Notes, 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes) prior to stated maturities;\n\u2022pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our stock or make other distributions;\n\u2022make acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022create or incur liens;\n\u2022transfer or sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022restrict dividends, distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries.\nOur unsecured revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our 2024 Notes, 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes, and the KWE notes require us to maintain compliance with specified financial covenants, including maximum balance sheet leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. In addition, loan agreements governing the mortgages that are secured by our properties may contain operational and financial covenants, including but not limited to, debt service coverage ratio covenants and, with respect to mortgages secured by certain properties in Europe, loan-to-value ratio covenants. Mortgages with such loan-to-value covenants require that the underlying properties be valued on a periodic basis (at least annually) and as such, adverse market conditions (which are influenced by factors that are outside of the Company\u2019s control) could result in a reduction in the fair value of the subject properties and a breach of the applicable covenant.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we received waivers on certain debt covenants in loan agreements governing a total of $266.9 million or 10% of our consolidated mortgage balance. These mortgages are secured by certain retail and hospitality assets in the United Kingdom and Ireland. All of these loans are non-recourse loans and the waivers are through the end of March 31, 2021 and beyond and typically cover interest cover and loan-to-value covenants. We expect to be in compliance with these covenants subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2020, or will seek additional waivers and/or extensions as, and if needed. In the event we are required to seek such additional waivers and/or extensions, we are currently confident that we will be able to secure the same. We are current on all payments (principal and interest) for our consolidated mortgages including the loans discussed above. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with or had received waivers on all financial mortgage debt and unsecured debt covenants. These covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, a default under one series of our indebtedness may also constitute a default under another series of our indebtedness.\nWe have guaranteed a number of loans in connection with various real estate investments, which may result in us being obligated to make certain payments.\nWe have provided recourse guarantees associated with loans secured by real estate. The maximum potential undiscounted amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantees was approximately $22.5 million at December 31, 2020. The guarantees expire through 2025, and our performance under the guarantees would be required to the extent there is a shortfall upon liquidation between the principal amount of the loan and the net sales proceeds of the property. If we were to become obligated to perform on these guarantees, our financial condition could suffer.\nWe are subject to certain \u201cnon-recourse carve out\u201d guarantees that may be triggered in the future.\nMost of our real estate properties are encumbered by traditional non-recourse debt obligations. In connection with most of these loans, however, we entered into certain \u201cnon-recourse carve out\u201d guarantees, which provide for the loans to become partially or fully recourse against us if certain triggering events occur. Although these events are different for each guarantee, some of the common events include:\n\u2022the special purpose property-owning subsidiary\u2019s filing a voluntary petition for bankruptcy;\n\u2022the special purpose property-owning subsidiary\u2019s failure to maintain its status as a special purpose entity; and\n\u2022subject to certain conditions, the special purpose property-owning subsidiary\u2019s failure to obtain lender\u2019s written consent prior to obtaining any subordinate financing or encumbering the associated property.\nIn the event that any of these triggering events occur and the loans become partially or fully recourse against us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and common stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect us.\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021, and LIBOR may be discontinued or modified by the end of 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARCC\u201d), which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative for U.S. Dollar LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. The ARCC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR From LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives, financial contracts and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. At this time, however, no consensus exists as\nto what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, and it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. Any changes in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR. If a published LIBOR rate is unavailable after 2021, the interest rates on certain of the Company\u2019s debt obligations could change. Any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, and as a result, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.3 million and $96.5 million of federal and California net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, as well as approximately $67.2 million of foreign tax credits, which generally can be used to offset future taxable income or taxes, as applicable. However, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\" the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits to offset its post-change federal taxable income or taxes, as applicable, may be limited. Generally, a corporation experiences such an ownership change if the percentage of its stock owned by its \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code, increases by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Based on our analysis, no ownership changes as defined under Section 382 have occurred which would result in limitations on the utilization of our domestic net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryovers. We may experience ownership change in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside of our control). Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply. Federal net operating loss carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 they may only be used to offset 80% of taxable income. All of our $2.3 million of federal net operating loss carryfowards were generated after December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we also had $245.5 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which could be subject to similar limitations in foreign jurisdictions based upon changes in equity ownership.\nWe may fail to comply with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nWe are subject to section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules of the SEC, which generally require our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Although our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020 and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an unqualified report as to the same, our management or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to come to the same conclusion in future periods. During the course of the review and testing of our internal controls, we may identify deficiencies and weaknesses and be unable to remediate them before we must provide the required reports. If our management or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results may suffer, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and the trading price of our stock may fall.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur directors and officers and their affiliates are significant stockholders, which makes it possible for them to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for approval and which influence may be in conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our directors and executive officers and their respective affiliates owned an aggregate of approximately 13% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. These stockholders will have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted for stockholder approval, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions. In addition, such influence by one or more of these stockholders could discourage others from attempting to purchase or take us over in a transaction that would be favorable to our other stockholders or reduce the market price offered for our common stock in such an event.\nWe may issue additional equity securities, which may dilute your interest in us.\nIn order to expand our business, we may consider offering and issuing additional equity or equity-based securities. If we issue and sell additional shares of our common stock, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted to the extent they do not participate in the offering. The number of shares that we may issue for cash in non-public offerings\nwithout stockholder approval will be limited by the rules of the NYSE or other exchange on which our securities are listed. However, we may issue and sell shares of our common stock in public offerings, and there generally are exceptions that allow companies to issue a limited number of equity securities in private offerings without stockholder approval, which could dilute your ownership.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically been and may in the future continue to be volatile due to factors such as:\n\u2022changes in real estate prices;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of our publicly held competitors;\n\u2022mergers and strategic alliances among any real estate companies;\n\u2022market conditions in the industry;\n\u2022changes in government regulation and taxes;\n\u2022shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts;\n\u2022investor sentiment toward the stock of real estate companies in general;\n\u2022announcements concerning us or our competitors; and\n\u2022the general state of the securities markets.\nOur common stock may be delisted, which could limit your ability to trade our common stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE, a national securities exchange. However, our common stock may not continue to be listed on the NYSE in the future. If the NYSE delists our common stock from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n\u2022a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company;\n\u2022a decreased ability for us to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; and\n\u2022limited liquidity for our stockholders due to thin trading.\nOur staggered board may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of stockholders, and certain anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage a change in control.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for our board of directors to be divided into three classes, each of which generally serves for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, at any annual meeting only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election. Since this \u201cstaggered board\u201d would prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our board of directors at any annual meeting, it may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of stockholders. Additionally, certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in the payment of a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may, under certain circumstances, make it more difficult for a person who would be an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to effect a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with us for a three-year period. An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d generally is defined as any entity or person that beneficially owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or any entity or person that is an affiliate or associate of such entity or person. A \u201cbusiness combination\u201d generally is defined to include, among other transactions, mergers, consolidations and certain other transactions, including sales, leases or other dispositions of assets with an aggregate market value equal to 10% or more of the aggregate market value of the corporation.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many stockholders. As a result, stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nWe may change our dividend policy.\nFuture distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and the amount and timing of distributions will depend upon cash generated by operating activities, our financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness, the certificate of designations governing our outstanding preferred stock and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time, and there can be no assurance as to the manner in which future dividends will be paid or that the current dividend level will be maintained in future periods.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a different judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by the law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees or our stockholders to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or other stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, other employees and other stockholders. Additionally, this exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims that are vested in the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction. For instance, the provision would not preclude the filing of claims brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations thereunder, in federal court.", "PERMNO": 92502, "SIC": 6510, "TIC": "KW"}
