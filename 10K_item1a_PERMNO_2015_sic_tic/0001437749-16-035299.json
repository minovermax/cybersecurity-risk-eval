{"cik": "1378140", "company": "Ocean Power Technologies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-07-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in prior reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and our registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If any of the following risks actually occur, they may materially harm our business and our financial condition and results of operations. In this event, the market price of our Common Stock could decline and your investment could be lost.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. We have experienced substantial and recurring losses from operations, which losses have caused an accumulated deficit of $177.9 million at April 30, 2016. At April 30, 2016, we had approximately $6.7 million in cash on hand. We generated revenues of only $.7 million in fiscal 2016, and $4.1 million in fiscal 2015. Based on the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of April 30, 2016, the Company believes that it will be able to finance its capital requirements and operations into at least the quarter ending January 31, 2017. We continue to experience operating losses and currently have only one primary revenue producing contract, which is an agreement with MES (the \u201cMES Agreement\u201d) to, among other things, lease and deploy our PB3 PowerBuoy off Kozushima Island, Japan and to provide certain engineering and other services. The total value of the lease and other services to be provided by us under the MES Agreement is $975,587. We currently expect the term of the lease to commence in March 2017, and the term of the MES Agreement to extend through August 2017. During the final three months of fiscal 2016, our net burn rate (cash used in operations less cash generated by operations) including product development spending was approximately $900,000 per month.\nWe have been funding our business principally through sales of our securities, and we expect to continue to fund our business with sales of our securities and, to a limited extent, with our revenues until, if ever, we generate sufficient cash flow to internally fund our business. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We anticipate that our operating expenses will be approximately $12 million in fiscal 2017 including product development spending of more than $5 million. However, we may choose to reduce our operating expenses through personnel reductions, and reductions in our research and development and other operating costs during fiscal year 2017, if we are not successful in our efforts to raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to increase our revenues and cash flow to a level which would support our operations and provide sufficient funds to pay our obligations for the foreseeable future. Further, we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional financing or raise additional capital or, if we are successful in our efforts to raise additional capital, of the terms and conditions upon which any such financing would be extended. If we are unable to meet our obligations, we would be forced to cease operations, in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company.\nWe may not be able to raise sufficient capital to continue to operate our business.\nHistorically, we have funded our business operations through sales of equity securities. We do not know whether we will be able to secure additional equity funding or, if secured, whether the terms will be favorable to us or our investors. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, pending litigation and investor sentiment. These factors may make additional funding unavailable, or the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional funding unattractive. If we issue additional equity securities to raise capital, our existing stockholders would experience dilution or may be subordinated to any rights, preferences or privileges granted to the new equity holders. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC registering the sale of up to $15,000,000 of debt, equity and other securities (the \u201cShelf Registration Statement\u201d), which was declared effective on April 26, 2016. Under the Shelf Registration Statement and our previous shelf registration statement on Form S-3 effective February 15, 2013 (the \u201c2013 Form S-3 Shelf\u201d), we offered and sold $293,343 in value of our Common Stock in an \u201cat the market\u201d offering facility (\u201cATM Facility\u201d) during the period from October 2015 through April 2016. We paid H.C. Wainwright & Co., our sales agent in the ATM Facility, a sales commission of approximately $4,400 related to those shares. We terminated the ATM Facility in June 2016 and will not offer additional securities under the ATM Facility.\nSales under our current Shelf Registration Statement or other sales of equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to our stockholders. We cannot assure you that we will be able to issue any such securities or, if issued, what the terms of those securities would be. In particular, any new securities issued could have rights senior to those associated with our Common Stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for substantially all of our revenues. The loss of, or a significant reduction in revenues from, any of these customers could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our operating results.\nHistorically, a small number of customers have provided substantially all of our revenues, and these revenues have been generated under development and cost reimbursement agreements rather than commercial contracts. The EU accounted for 58%, the DOE accounted for 28% and MES accounted for 14% of our revenues during fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2015, revenues from the EU accounted for 23%, revenues from the DOE accounted for 37% and revenues from MES accounted for 40% of our total revenues. Our existing contracts with the DOE were completed in fiscal 2016. In order to receive future funding from the DOE, we are required to enter into additional contracts with the DOE, which would require appropriation by the U.S. Congress. Additional funding for projects may not be approved or we may not be able to negotiate future agreements on acceptable terms, if at all.\nGenerally, we recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion. In certain circumstances, revenue under contracts that have specified milestones or other performance criteria may be recognized only when our customer acknowledges that such criteria have been satisfied. In addition, recognition of revenue (and the related costs) may be deferred for fixed-price contracts until contract completion if we are unable to reasonably estimate the total costs of the project prior to completion. Because we currently have a small number of customers and contracts, problems with a single contract would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently only have one revenue producing contract, which is our agreement with MES. Historically, we have relied on a small group of customers for substantially all of our revenue, and we expect that such concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. A customer\u2019s payment default, or the loss of a customer as a result of competition, creditworthiness, our failure to perform, our inability to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts, or otherwise, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to secure additional commercial customers, or additional revenue-generating contracts.\nIf sufficient demand for our PowerBuoys does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, our revenue generation will be limited, and it is unlikely that we will be able to achieve and, if achieved, then sustain profitability.\nEven if wave energy technology achieves broad commercial acceptance, our PowerBuoys may not prove to be a commercially viable technology for generating electricity from ocean waves. We have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources since our inception in the development of our PowerBuoys, but have not yet achieved successful commercialization of our PowerBuoys. As we seek to begin to manufacture, market, sell and deploy our PowerBuoys in greater quantities, we may encounter unforeseen hurdles that would limit the commercial viability of our PowerBuoys, including unanticipated manufacturing, deployment, operating, maintenance and other costs. Our target customers and we may also encounter technical obstacles to deploying, operating and maintaining PowerBuoys.\nIf demand for our PowerBuoys fails to develop sufficiently, it is unlikely that we will be able to grow our business or generate sufficient revenues to achieve and then sustain profitability. In addition, demand for PowerBuoys in our presently targeted markets, including coastal North America, Europe, Australia and Japan, may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate.\nIf we are not successful in commercializing our PowerBuoy, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights relating to our technology and products, the commercial value of our technology and products may be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to obtain protection in the United States and other countries for our products by establishing and maintaining intellectual property rights relating to or incorporated into our technology and products. We own a variety of patents and patent applications in the U.S. and corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign jurisdictions. However, we have not obtained patent protection in each market in which we plan to compete. In addition, we do not know how successful we would be should we choose to assert our patents against suspected infringers and we do not know what the cost to do so would be. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Even if issued, patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection we may have for our products. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are the subject of pending and threatened securities and other litigation, which is costly and time-consuming to defend, and if decided against us, could require us to pay substantial judgments or settlements. We may be the subject of future securities or other litigation, which could adversely affect our company, our business and our liquidity.\nWe and our former Chief Executive Officer, Charles Dunleavy, are defendants in the Securities Class Action discussed elsewhere in the Annual Report. On May 5, 2016, the parties entered into the Stipulation in which they agreed to a settlement of the Securities Class Action, subject to Court approval after notice to class members. The Stipulation provides, among other things, for a settlement payment by or on behalf of us of $3,000,000 in cash, of which we will pay $500,000 and our insurer will pay $2,500,000, and the issuance by the Company of 380,000 shares of its Common Stock to the class members. In connection with the proposed settlement, the parties have agreed to execute mutually agreeable releases. On June 7, 2016, the Court entered an Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Settlement. The Court has scheduled a hearing for November 14, 2016 to determine, among other things, whether to grant final approval of the proposed settlement. The amounts agreed in the Stipulation agreement, including the amount to be contributed by our insurance carrier, have been reflected in our financial statements as of April 30, 2016. The Stipulation is subject to approval by the Court following notice to all class members. We cannot assure you that the Court will approve the Stipulation or that this pending litigation will be settled on such terms or at all.\nWe are the subject of certain other pending and threatened litigation, some of which arises, in part, from the securities offering that we conducted in April 2014 and other activities. This litigation is costly and time consuming to defend and may distract our management from the daily operations of our business. We may be the subject of additional future securities litigation, which could adversely affect our company, our business and our liquidity. Although we maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance coverage, we cannot assure you that this insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover the substantial fees of lawyers and other professionals advisors relating to these pending lawsuits or any future litigation, our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors who may become parties to such pending and future actions, or the amount of any judgments or settlements that we may be obligated to pay in connection with these lawsuits. In addition, these actions have caused our insurance premiums and retention amounts to increase, and we may be subject to additional increases in the future or be subjected to other changes in our insurance coverages. Further, given the volatility of the market price of our Common Stock, we may be subject to further class action securities and other litigation. Accordingly, we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial legal expenses, judgments and/or settlements relating to pending, threatened and future litigation and our management\u2019s time and attention may be diverted from the operation of our business, which could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how, particularly with respect to our PowerBuoy control and electricity generating systems. We generally seek to protect this information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nWe have a pending SEC investigation that has caused us to incur significant costs and expenses and has diverted our management time, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to raise capital in the future.\nWe have received two subpoenas from the SEC arising out of public disclosures related to a now-terminated agreement between VWP and ARENA, and related to our April 4, 2014 public offering. We have provided information to the SEC in response to that subpoena, and we continue to respond and cooperate with the SEC in this investigation. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant professional fees and other costs related to the SEC investigation. We are unable to predict what action, if any, might be taken by the SEC or its staff as a result of this investigation or what impact, if any, the cost of responding to the SEC\u2019s investigation or its ultimate outcome might have on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We have not established any provision for losses relating to this matter. If the SEC were to conclude that enforcement action is appropriate, we could be required to pay civil penalties and fines, and the SEC could impose other sanctions against us or against our current and former officers and directors. In addition, our Board of Directors, management and employees may expend a substantial amount of time on the SEC investigation, diverting resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain management and other qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management and other key product development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing employees. We have limited financial resources and cannot be certain that we will be able to attract, retain and motivate such employees. The loss of the services of one or more of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is a risk that we will not be able to retain or replace these key employees. Implementation of our business plans will be highly dependent upon our ability to hire and retain senior executives as well as talented staff in various fields of expertise.\nIn January 2015, we hired a new President and Chief Executive Officer. Following the resignation of a Director in March 2016, we added two new Directors in May 2016 for a total of six Directors. As of July 2016, only three of our six Directors have served on our Board of Directors for 18 months or longer.\nChanges in senior management are inherently disruptive, and efforts to implement any new strategic or operating goals may not succeed in the absence of a long-term management team. Changes to strategic or operating goals with the appointment of new executives may themselves prove to be disruptive. Periods of transition in senior management leadership are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations and due to cultural differences that may result from changes in strategy and style. Without consistent and experienced leadership, customers, employees, creditors, stockholders and others may lose confidence in us.\nTo be successful, we need to retain key personnel. Qualified individuals, including engineers and project managers, are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. With the exception of our President and Chief Executive Officer, all of our officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they can terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace. If we lose the services of key personnel, or do not hire or retain other personnel for key positions, our business, results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our growth, this could adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe scope of our operations to date has been limited, and we do not have experience operating on the scale that we believe may be necessary to achieve profitable operations. Our current personnel, facilities, systems and internal procedures and controls may not be adequate to support future growth. This factor, when combined with the technical complexity of some of our development efforts, may result in our inability to meet certain customer expectations or deadlines and could result in the amendment to, or termination of, customer contracts or relationships. To realize our desired growth, we may need to add sales, marketing and engineering offices in our existing and/or additional locations, which may include Australia, Japan, and continental Europe, and which may result in additional organizational complexity.\nTo manage the expansion of our operations, we may be required to improve our operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, increase our manufacturing capacity and throughput and expand, train and manage our employee base, which may need to increase significantly if we are to be able to fulfill our current manufacturing and growth plans. Our management may also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties, as well as attract new customers and suppliers. If we do not meet these challenges, we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures.\nWe have only manufactured a limited number of PowerBuoys to date over a 15 year period and to date we have not produced PowerBuoys in any significant quantity or for commercial production. Our PowerBuoys have been used for testing and development and may not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how they will perform over their estimated useful life.\nWe began developing and testing wave energy technology over 15 years ago. However, to date, we have only manufactured a limited number of PowerBuoys for use in ocean testing and development. The longest continuous in-ocean deployment of our PowerBuoy was from December 2009 to January 2012 and was an earlier iteration of our PowerBuoy. As a result, our PowerBuoys may not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how they will perform over their estimated useful life. Our technology may not yet have demonstrated that our engineering and test results can be duplicated in volume or in commercial production. We have conducted and plan to continue to conduct practical testing of our PowerBuoy. If our PowerBuoy ultimately proves ineffective or unfeasible, we may not be able to engage in commercial production of our products or we may become liable to our customers for quantities we are obligated but are unable to produce. If our PowerBuoys perform below expectations, we could lose customers and face substantial repair and replacement expenses which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability and positive cash flow.\nWe have incurred net losses since we began operations in 1994, including net losses attributable to Ocean Power Technologies, Inc. of $13.1 million in fiscal 2016 and $13.1 million in fiscal 2015. As of April 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $177.9 million. To date, our activities have consisted primarily of activities related to the development and testing of our technologies and our PowerBuoy. Thus, our losses to date have resulted primarily from costs incurred in our research and development programs and from our selling, general and administrative costs. As we continue to develop our proprietary technologies, we expect to continue to have a net use of cash from operating activities unless or until we achieve positive cash flow from the commercialization of our products and services.\nWe do not know whether we will be able to successfully commercialize our PowerBuoys, or whether we can achieve profitability. There is significant uncertainty about our ability to successfully commercialize our PowerBuoys in our targeted markets. Even if we do achieve commercialization of our PowerBuoy and become profitable, we may not be able to achieve or, if achieved, sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe face numerous accident and safety risks and hazards, including extreme environmental hazards, which are inherent in offshore operations.\nPortions of our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the building, testing, deploying and maintenance of our PowerBuoys. These hazards and risks could result in personal injuries, loss of life, liberation of a PowerBuoy from its moorings due to extreme environmental conditions and damage caused by its drifting, and other damages, which may include damage to our properties, including our PowerBuoy, and the properties of others and other consequential damages, and could lead to the suspension of certain of our operations, large damage claims, damage to our safety reputation and a loss of business. Some of these risks may be uninsurable and some claims may exceed our insurance coverage. Therefore, the occurrence of a significant accident or other risk event or hazard that is not fully covered by insurance could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results and, even if fully covered by insurance, could materially and adversely affect our business due to the impact on our reputation for safety. In addition, the risks inherent in our business are such that we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at reasonable rates.\nWe anticipate that our contracts with our customers will generally include cancellation for convenience clauses that permit our customers to terminate the contract for their convenience; if a customer were to terminate its contract with us for convenience, this could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe anticipate that our contracts with our customers will be structured as capital equipment contracts or capital equipment leases, and could include a cancellation for convenience clause, which we believe is relatively standard in these types of contracts. Cancellation for convenience clauses allow the customer to cancel the contract or lease at their option without cause prior to defined points in time, generally subject to a reasonable notice period. Our agreement with MES includes a cancellation for convenience clause. If MES or any of our future customers were to cancel their contracts with us for convenience, such cancellation could adversely affect our business.\nOur relationships with our strategic partners may not be successful, and we may not be successful in establishing additional relationships, either of which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and services.\nAn important element of our business strategy is to enter into application development agreements and strategic alliances with companies committed to providing products and services which require in-ocean energy sources. Generally, these types of relationships obligate us to provide certain services or perform certain tasks in connection with the relationship with the alliance partner, and we are generally responsible for paying the costs we incur relating to such services or tasks. These relationships generally are not expected to provide us with any revenues or sources of financing. We currently have strategic arrangements with WCS, Gardline and National Buoy Data Center. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable alliance partners, we may fail to meet our business objectives for the commercialization of our PowerBuoys. We may face significant competition in seeking appropriate alliance partners. Moreover, these development agreements and strategic alliances are complex to negotiate and time consuming to document. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish additional strategic relationships or other alternative arrangements. The terms of any additional strategic relationships or other arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us. Furthermore, even if we are able to find, negotiate and enter into these relationships, such arrangements may be conditional upon our receipt of additional funding. There can be no assurance that we will receive such additional funding. In addition, strategic relationships may not be successful, and we may be unable to sell and market our PowerBuoys to these companies and their affiliates and customers in the future, or growth opportunities may not materialize, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are and may become the target of additional securities litigation, which is costly and time-consuming to defend.\nIn the past, companies that experience significant volatility in the market price of their publicly-traded securities have become subject to class action securities litigation. Our stock price has been volatile, and class action securities litigation and derivative lawsuits have been filed against us and it is possible that additional lawsuits could be brought against us in the future. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. These lawsuits assert types of claims that, if resolved against us, could give rise to substantial damages, and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these lawsuits, or any future lawsuits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. Even if these lawsuits, or any future lawsuits, are not resolved against us, the costs of defending such lawsuits may be material to our business and our operations. Moreover, these lawsuits may divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. For more information on our legal proceedings, see Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report and Note 13 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies - Litigation\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016.\nOur future success in our selected markets depends in part on our ability to achieve cost savings over existing and incumbent solutions. If we are unable to achieve cost savings relating to our PowerBuoy, the commercial prospects for our PowerBuoy may be adversely affected.\nOur goal is to commercialize our PowerBuoy. Our success in meeting this objective depends, in part, on our ability to provide energy to our prospective customers at a cost savings over existing and incumbent power solutions already being utilized by our customers and potential customers. We have experienced problems and delays in the development and deployment of our PowerBuoy in the past, and could experience similar delays or other difficulties in the future. If we are unable to demonstrate to our prospective customers that our PowerBuoy is cost competitive with existing alternative power sources, or if it takes us longer to do so than we anticipate, we may be unable to continue our business, achieve commercialization of our PowerBuoy, achieve a competitive position, satisfy our contractual obligations, or become profitable. In addition, if the costs associated with these development efforts exceed our projections, our results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nProblems with the quality or performance of our PowerBuoys would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur agreements with customers will generally include guarantees with respect to the quality and performance of our PowerBuoys. Because of the limited operating history of our PowerBuoys, we have been required to make analytical assumptions regarding the durability, reliability and performance of the systems, and we may not be able to predict whether and to what extent we may be required to perform under the guarantees that we expect to give our customers. Our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our PowerBuoys, causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective systems in the future. We will bear the risk of claims long after we have sold our PowerBuoys and recognized revenue. Moreover, any widespread product failures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting, or if our internal controls are not effective, our business and financial results may suffer.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. In fiscal 2016, our controller voluntarily resigned from our company to accept another position of employment, and we have not replaced her with a full-time employee, but rather have delegated most of her duties to other personnel, including outsourcing a portion of these responsibilities. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to the integrity of our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could also be a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nAny joint venture or other collaborative projects that we enter into, or any failure to identify appropriate joint venture candidates, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is part of our strategy to co-invest in some of our wave power projects with third parties through joint ventures by acquiring non-controlling interests in special purpose entities, or to engage with third parties in other similar collaborative projects. We may not be able to identify appropriate strategic partners, or successfully negotiate, finance or operate any joint ventures or other collaborative projects. Even if an appropriate strategic partner has been identified and engaged, such relationships with third parties could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, loss of sole decision-making authority and control of operations and that are material to our business, and the possibility that a strategic partner might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Strategic alliances may be expensive to implement and there is the associated risk that a strategic partner may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions that are contrary to our policies or objectives. Moreover, disputes between us and a strategic partner may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. Consequently, both a strategic alliance itself and the failure to identify appropriate potential opportunities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have not yet deployed a wave power array of two or more PowerBuoys in a single geographic location. If we are unable to successfully deploy a multiple-system wave power array, our capability to generate revenues may be limited, and we may be unable to achieve and then maintain profitability.\nWe have not yet deployed a wave power array of two or more PowerBuoys. Whether we are able to do so is contingent upon, among other things, our ability to manufacture and produce multiple PowerBuoys in a short period of time, receipt of required governmental permits, obtaining adequate financing, successful array design and implementation and, finally, successful deployment and connection of the PowerBuoys.\nWe have not yet conducted ocean testing or otherwise installed in the ocean a multiple-system wave power array. In particular, unlike single-system wave power arrays, multiple-system wave power arrays may require the use of an underwater substation to connect the power transmission cables from, and collect the electricity generated by, each PowerBuoy in the array. We have not yet deployed an underwater substation connected to multiple PowerBuoys. In addition, unanticipated issues may arise with the logistics and mechanics of deploying and maintaining multiple PowerBuoys at a single site and the additional equipment associated with these multiple-system wave power arrays.\nThe development and deployment of an array of PowerBuoys could require us to incur significant expenses for preliminary engineering, permitting and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed. We may be unsuccessful in accomplishing any of these tasks or doing so on a timely basis.\nFailure by third parties to supply or manufacture components of our products or to deploy our systems timely or properly could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been and expect to continue to be highly dependent on third parties to supply or manufacture components of our PowerBuoys. If, for any reason, our third-party manufacturers or vendors are not willing or able to provide us with components or supplies in a timely fashion, or at all, our ability to manufacture and sell many of our products could be impaired.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with our third-party manufacturers or vendors. If we do not develop ongoing relationships with vendors located in different regions, we may not be successful at controlling unit costs as our manufacturing volume increases. We may not be able to negotiate new arrangements with these third parties on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, we rely on third parties, under our oversight, for the deployment and mooring of our PowerBuoys. We have utilized several different deployment methods, including towing the PowerBuoy to the deployment location and transporting the PowerBuoy to the deployment location by barge or ocean workboat. If these third parties do not properly deploy our systems, cannot effectively deploy the PowerBuoy on a large, commercial scale, or otherwise do not perform adequately, or if we fail to recruit and retain third parties to deploy our systems in particular geographic areas, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience. If we are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity in a cost-effective manner, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe plan to manufacture key components of our PowerBuoys, including the PTO advanced control and generation systems, while outsourcing the manufacturing for other components of our PowerBuoys, including the structure itself. However, we have only manufactured our PowerBuoys in limited quantities for use in development and testing and have limited commercial manufacturing experience, and our work with our vendors has not included work on multiple orders on time-critical deadlines. Our future success depends on our ability to significantly increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput in a cost-effective and efficient manner, and to manage multiple vendors with several orders on specific deadlines. In order to meet our growth objectives, we will need to increase our engineering, contract management, and manufacturing staff. There is intense competition for hiring qualified technical and engineering personnel, and we have limited funding available to retain such additional staff. Therefore, we may not be able to hire a sufficient number of qualified personnel to allow us to meet our growth objectives.\nWe may be unable to develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards or production volumes necessary to successfully commercialize our PowerBuoys. If we cannot do so, we may be unable to expand our business, satisfy our contractual obligations or become profitable. Even if we are successful in developing our manufacturing capabilities and processes, we may not be able to do so in time to meet our commercialization schedule or satisfy the requirements of our customers.\nOur investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on a co-venture\u2019s financial condition and disputes between us and our co-ventures.\nIt is part of our strategy we may co-invest with third parties through joint ventures or by acquiring non-controlling interests in special purpose entities. In these situations, we will not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the joint venture. Investments in joint ventures involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that our co-ventures might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Our co-ventures may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions that are contrary to our policies or objectives. Disputes between us and our co-ventures may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners or co-ventures might result in additional risk.\nIf we infringe or are alleged to have infringed upon intellectual property rights of third parties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur products may infringe, or be claimed to infringe, upon patents or patent applications under which we do not hold licenses or other rights. Third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the United States and abroad. From time to time, we receive correspondence from third parties offering to license patents to us. Correspondence of this nature might be used to establish that we received notice of certain patents in the event of subsequent patent infringement litigation. Third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay manufacturing or sales of the product or component that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party and be required to pay license fees, royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other types of patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. In addition, if we were to license our intellectual property to others, we may be required to indemnify our licensee if the licensed intellectual property is found to be infringing on a third party\u2019s rights. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources.\nOur targeted markets are highly competitive. We compete against incumbent solutions already being utilized by our customers and potential customers. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may be unable to increase our revenues and achieve or maintain profitability.\nIn our targeted markets, which are highly competitive, we compete against incumbent power solutions already being utilized by our customers and potential customers. If we are unable to demonstrate to our customers and our potential customers that our PowerBuoy is cost competitive to their existing alternative power solutions, or if it takes us longer to do so than we anticipate, we may be unable to expand our business, maintain our competitive position, satisfy our contractual obligations, continue to commercialize our PowerBuoy, or become profitable. In addition, if the cost associated with these development efforts exceeds our projections, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, competition may arise from other companies manufacturing similar products, developing different products that produce energy more efficiently than our products, or making improvements to traditional energy-producing methods or technologies, any of which could make our products less attractive or render them obsolete. If we are not successful in manufacturing systems that generate competitively priced power, we may not be able to respond effectively to competitive pressures from other renewable energy technologies or improvements to existing technologies.\nIf we are unable to respond effectively to such competitive forces, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our targeted markets are subject to their own inherent risks, and if those risks should materialize then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur product development costs are substantial and may increase in the future.\nOur product development costs primarily relate to our efforts to increase the output, durability and commercial viability of our PowerBuoy. Our product development costs were $7.0 million in fiscal 2016 and $4.1 million in fiscal 2015. It is our goal to fund the majority of our product development expenses, including cost sharing obligations under some of our customer contracts, over the next several years with sources of external funding, but we do not currently have any such committed sources of funding, and we may not be able to secure any such funding in the future. If we are unable to obtain external funding, our operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we may be required to curtail our product development expenses, among other consequences.\nWe may be subject to additional litigation and other regulatory proceedings that may negatively impact our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to additional litigation and/or regulatory actions relating to our business. The initiation or defense of litigation or regulatory actions would require us to make certain expenditures and divert the attention of our management away from operating our business. In addition, an unfavorable decision or outcome could result in further, potentially significant, expenditures.\nOur PowerBuoys have been subject to periodic in-ocean testing and are reliant in part on the results of computer modeling and simulation.\nOur PowerBuoy systems have been subject to periodic ocean testing since 1997. However, not all PowerBuoys have been subject to extensive ocean testing and may rely on computer modeling and simulation that attempt to predict performance under various ocean wave conditions and other parameters in a deployment environment. Use of accelerated life testing, as well as computer simulation models, has inherent risks and performance could be substantially different than predicted. We have conducted limited operational testing, accelerated life testing and periodic in-ocean testing, and we may later discover one or more significant defects requiring redesign and retrofit into existing systems, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations and revenues.\nWe market and plan to market our products in multiple international markets. If we are unable to manage our international operations effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe market and plan to market our products in multiple global regions, including Europe, Australia, North America and parts of Asia, and we are therefore subject to risks associated with having international operations. Revenues from customers who are based outside of the U.S. accounted for 72% of our revenues in fiscal 2016 and 63% of our revenues in fiscal 2015. Risks inherent in international operations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nchanges in general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nunexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements, including those with respect to renewable energy, environmental protection, permitting, export duties and quotas;\n\u25cf\ntrade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our PowerBuoys and make us less competitive in some countries;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in exchange rates may affect demand for our PowerBuoys and may adversely affect our profitability in U.S. dollars to the extent the price of our PowerBuoys and cost of raw materials and labor are denominated in a foreign currency;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty with staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u25cf\ncomplexity of, and costs relating to compliance with, the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas markets in which we offer and sell our PowerBuoys;\n\u25cf\ninability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems.\nOur business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries. Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, on our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. We may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The current economic environment, particularly the macroeconomic pressures in certain European countries, may increase these risks.\nOur financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. For these reasons, comparing our financial results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. Our future quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may be significantly different from those we have recorded in the past or which we expect for the future. Our financial results in some quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this \"Risk Factors\" section, including the following factors, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u25cf\ndelays in permitting or acquiring necessary regulatory consents;\n\u25cf\ndelays in the timing of contract awards and determinations of work scope;\n\u25cf\ndelays in funding for or deployment of wave energy projects;\n\u25cf\nchanges in cost estimates relating to wave energy project completion, which under percentage-of-completion accounting principles could lead to significant fluctuations in revenue or to changes in the timing of our recognition of revenue from those projects;\n\u25cf\ndelays in meeting, or the failure to meet, specified contractual milestones or other performance criteria under project contracts or in completing project contracts that could delay or prevent the recognition of revenue that would otherwise be earned;\n\u25cf\nreductions in the availability or level of subsidies and incentives for renewable energy sources;\n\u25cf\ndecisions made by parties with whom we have commercial relationships not to proceed with anticipated projects;\n\u25cf\nincreases in the length of our sales cycle; and\n\u25cf\ninherent uncertainties in our manufacturing processes.\nIf we become ineligible for or are otherwise unable to replace our contract with U.S. or foreign governments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nHistorically we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from U.S. federal government contracts, which are subject to special funding restrictions, regulatory requirements and eligibility standards and which the government may terminate at any time or determine not to extend after their scheduled expiration. During fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, we derived 28% and 37%, respectively, of our total revenue from contracts with the U.S. federal government and 72% and 63%, respectively, from contracts with foreign entities. We may not be successful in securing any additional contracts with the U.S. federal government in the future. Any such contracts are dependent on, among other things, appropriate funding by the U.S. Congress. If we are unable to replace these contracts, our business, financial condition and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGovernment contracts are also subject to contractual and regulatory requirements that may increase our costs of doing business and could expose us to substantial contractual damages, civil fines and criminal penalties for noncompliance. These requirements include business ethics, equal employment opportunity, environmental, foreign purchasing, most-favored pricing and accounting provisions, among others. Payments that we receive under government contracts are subject to audit and potential refunds after the final contract payment is received.\nCurrency translation and transaction risk may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. As a result, we are subject to currency translation risk. A large percentage of our revenues may be generated outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies in the future. Changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could affect our revenues and cost of revenues, and could result in exchange losses. In addition, we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or sale transaction using a different currency from our reporting currency. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Currently, we do not engage in any exchange rate hedging activities and, as a result, any volatility in currency exchange rates may have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully negotiate and enter into service contracts with our customers on terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to diversify our revenue stream will be impaired.\nAn important element of our business strategy is to enter into service contracts with our customers under which we would be paid fees for services related to the maintenance and operation of the PowerBuoys purchased from us. In addition, we may offer to lease PowerBuoys, sell power generated by PowerBuoys or sell data gathered by sensors on our PowerBuoys. Even if customers purchase or lease our PowerBuoys, they may not enter into service contracts with us. We may not be able to negotiate service, power sale or other contracts that provide us with any additional profit opportunities. Even if we successfully negotiate and enter into such service contracts, our customers may terminate them prematurely or they may not be profitable for a variety of reasons, including the presence of unforeseen hurdles or costs. In addition, if we were unable to perform adequately under such service contracts our efforts to successfully market the PowerBuoys could be impaired. Any one of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince our PowerBuoys can only be deployed in certain geographic locations, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected.\nNot all coastal areas worldwide have appropriate natural resources for our PowerBuoys to harness wave energy. Seasonal and local variations, water depth and the effect of particular locations of islands and other geographical features may limit our ability to deploy our PowerBuoys in certain coastal areas. If we are unable to identify and deploy PowerBuoys at sufficient sites with appropriate natural resources to permit our PowerBuoys to capture wave energy, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected.\nOur contracts with governmental entities could negatively affect our intellectual property rights, and our ability to commercialize our products could be impaired.\nOur agreements with government agencies in large part fund the research and development of our PowerBuoy. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, technical data and software, generally including, at a minimum, a non-exclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention, technical data or software for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise \"march-in\" rights. March-in rights refer to the right of the U.S. government to require us to grant a license to the technology to a responsible applicant or, if we refuse, the government may grant the license itself. U.S. government-funded inventions must be reported to the government and U.S. government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications; our rights in such inventions will normally be subject to government license rights, periodic post-contract utilization reporting, foreign manufacturing restrictions and march-in rights.\nThe government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the technology or because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to U.S. industry. Our government-sponsored research contracts are subject to audit and require that we provide regular written technical updates on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, and, at the conclusion of the research contract, a final report on the results of our technical research. Because these reports are generally available to the public, third parties may obtain some aspects of our sensitive confidential information. Moreover, if we fail to provide these reports or to provide accurate or complete reports, the government may obtain rights to any intellectual property arising from the related research. Funding from government contracts also may limit when and how we can deploy our technology developed under those contracts. Foreign governments with which we contract to provide funding for our research and development may seek similar rights.\nIf we are unable to obtain all necessary regulatory permits and approvals, we will not be able to implement our planned projects or business plan.\nOffshore deployment of our PowerBuoy is heavily regulated. Each of our deployments is subject to multiple permitting and approval requirements. We are dependent on state, federal and regional government agencies for such permits and approvals. Due to the unique nature of in-ocean power generation and the associated environmental impact of PowerBuoy deployment, we expect our projects to receive close scrutiny by permitting agencies, approval authorities and the public, which could result in substantial delay in the permitting process. Successful challenges by any parties opposed to our deployments could result in increased costs, or in the denial of necessary permits and approvals.\nIf we are unable to obtain necessary permits and approvals in connection with any or all of our projects, those projects would not be implemented and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Further, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with all such permits and approvals. If we violate or fail to comply with these permits and approvals, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.\nRisk Relating to the Referendum on the U.K.\u2019s Membership in the European Union\nThe announcement of the U.K.\u2019s advisory referendum vote to exit from the European Union (\u201cBREXIT\u201d) could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with existing and potential customers, suppliers and employees. The referendum is non-binding; however, if passed into law, negotiations would then commence to determine the terms of the U.K\u2019s future relationship with the E.U., including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the E.U. The effects of BREXIT will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The measures could potentially disrupt some of our target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate, and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, BREXIT could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. In addition, the announcement of BREXIT has caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. The announcement of BREXIT also may create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers and potential customers to monitor their costs and reduce their budgets for our products and services. Any of these effects of BREXIT, among others, could materially adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nBusiness activities conducted by our third-party contractors and us involve the use of hazardous materials, which require compliance with environmental and occupational safety laws regulating the use of such materials. If we violate these laws, we could be subject to significant fines, liabilities or other adverse consequences.\nOur manufacturing operations, particularly some of the activities undertaken by our third-party suppliers and manufacturers, involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. Accordingly, our third-party contractors and we are subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws governing the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those relating to the use, handling and disposal of these materials. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials. In the event of an accident or failure to comply with environmental or health and safety laws and regulations, we could be held liable for resulting damages, including damages to natural resources, fines and penalties, and any such liability could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that environmental laws and regulations will not change or become more stringent in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and any liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWave energy technology may not gain broad commercial acceptance and, therefore, our revenues may not increase and we may be unable to achieve and, even if achieved, sustain profitability.\nWave energy technology is at an early stage of development, and the extent to which wave energy power generation will be commercially viable is uncertain. Many factors may affect the commercial acceptance of wave energy technology, including the following:\n\u25cf\nperformance, reliability and cost-effectiveness of wave energy technology compared to conventional and other renewable energy sources and products;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments relating to other renewable energy generation technologies;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the cost or viability of conventional and renewable energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of oil and other fossil fuels;\n\u25cf\noverall growth in the renewable energy equipment market;\n\u25cf\navailability and terms of government subsidies and incentives to support the development of renewable energy sources, including wave energy;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in capital expenditures by independent power producers, which tend to decrease when the economy slows and interest rates increase; and\n\u25cf\nthe development of new and profitable applications requiring the type of remote electric power provided by our autonomous wave energy systems.\nIf wave energy technology does not gain broad commercial acceptance, it is unlikely that we will be able to commercialize our PowerBuoy and our business will be materially harmed, in which case, we may curtail or cease operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf we issue additional shares of our equity securities in the future, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution in the value of their investment or their ownership interest.\nOur certificate of incorporation currently authorizes us to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of our Common Stock and to issue and designate the rights of, without stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. In the future, in order to raise additional capital, we may offer additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Common Stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share paid by other investors, and dilution to our stockholders in the value of their investment and their ownership and voting interest in the Company could result. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by existing investors, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\nAs discussed below, we have entered into a Stipulation to settle certain pending securities class action litigation under which, if approved by the court following notice to class members, we are obligated to issue an additional 380,000 shares of our Common Stock to class members as partial consideration for the settlement. The issuance of such shares pursuant to the Settlement would be dilutive to our existing stockholders. In addition, we have a significant number of stock options and warrants outstanding. To the extent that outstanding stock options or warrants have been or may be exercised or other shares issued, current stockholders and future investors who have purchased our Common Stock will experience further dilution. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that we issue new securities, or raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders or result in downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock.\nWe may issue or sell shares of our Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our Common Stock in the future and this may depress our stock price.\nOur certificate of incorporation currently authorizes us to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock, and to issue and designate the rights of without stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Future sales of our Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Common Stock, may depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nAlso, we have entered into a Stipulation to settle certain securities class action litigation captioned In re Ocean Power Technologies, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case No. 14-3799 (FLW) (LHG) (District of New Jersey) (the \u201cSecurities Class Action\u201d), which is pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. If approved by the Court, the Stipulation will resolve the claims asserted in the Securities Class Action against us, the underwriter of our April 4, 2014 public offering, and one of our former officers and directors, by a class consisting of investors in the Company from January 14, 2014 through July 29, 2014, and investors who purchased our securities pursuant to and/or traceable to our April 4, 2014 offering of shares of our Common Stock. The Stipulation provides, among other things, for the issuance by the Company of an additional 380,000 shares of our Common Stock (the \u201cSettlement Shares\u201d) to the class members. On June 7, 2016, the Court entered an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement. The terms of the Stipulation, including the settlement payment and the issuance of the Settlement Shares, are subject to approval by the Court following notice to all class members. We cannot assure you that the Court will approve the Stipulation or that this pending litigation will be settled on such terms or at all.\nHistorically, our stock price has been volatile and this is likely to continue; purchasers of our Common Stock could incur substantial losses as a result.\nHistorically, the market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly, and we expect that this will continue. Purchasers of our Common Stock could incur substantial losses relating to their investment in our stock as a result. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, the 52-week high and low prices for our Common Stock were $8.50 and $0.95, respectively. Also, the stock market in general has recently experienced volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations could result in fluctuations in the price of our Common Stock, which could cause purchasers of our Common Stock to incur substantial losses. The market price for our Common Stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our business or with respect to our projects;\n\u25cf\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nquarterly or annual variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions in the conventional and renewable energy industries and issuance of new or changed securities analysts' reports or recommendations;\n\u25cf\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our Common Stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our Common Stock;\n\u25cf\ninvestor perception of our company and of our targeted markets; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us.\nAs a result of our reincorporation in Delaware in April 2007, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u25cf\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; and\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \"poison pill\" that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors.\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation. In addition, absent the approval of our Board of Directors, our bylaws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, which is generally a person who together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Section 203 may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.\nIf securities or industry analysts fail to cover us, or do not publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business or our industry from time to time. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price or trading volume of our Common Stock to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our Common Stock or release a negative report, or if our operating results do not meet analyst expectations, the price of our Common Stock could decline.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 91964, "SIC": 3612, "TIC": "OPTT"}
