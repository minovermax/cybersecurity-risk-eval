{"cik": "1634117", "company": "Barnes & Noble Education, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-07-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones faced by us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and the trading price of our Common Stock could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face significant competition in our business, and we expect such competition to increase.\nThe market for course materials, including textbooks and supplemental materials, is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We are experiencing growing competition from alternative media and alternative sources of textbooks and course-related materials, such as websites that sell or rent textbooks, eTextbooks, digital content and other merchandise directly to students; online resources, including open educational resources; publishers including Cengage, Pearson and McGraw Hill, bypassing the bookstore distribution channel by selling directly to students and educational institutions; print-on-demand textbooks; textbook rental companies; and student-to-student transactions over the Internet. We also have competition from other college bookstore operators and educational content providers, including Akademos, a virtual bookstore and marketplace for academic institutions; Amazon.com, an e-commerce operator and a provider of contract services to colleges and universities; BBA Solutions, a college textbook retailer; bn.com, the e-commerce platform of Barnes & Noble, Inc.; Chegg.com, an online textbook rental company; Civitas Learning, a learning analytics platform; eCampus, an online provider of course materials; Follett Corporation, a contract operator of campus bookstores; IndiCo, an entity created by National Association of College Bookstores (\u201cNACS\u201d); Texas Book Company, bookstore management and operations; and Vital Source Technologies, Inc., a digital course materials provider. We also have competition from providers of eTextbooks, such as Apple iTunes, Blackboard, Google, and Redshelf; Vital Source Technologies, Inc., and various private textbook rental websites. In addition, Akademos and Amazon have recently begun to develop relationships with colleges and universities to provide online bookstore solutions which not only competes with our physical bookstore operations but also competes with our subsidiary MBS\u2019 Direct virtual solution. MBS Direct also faces competition from Ambassador Educational Solutions, eCampus, edMap, EdTech, Follett Corporation, Texas Book Company, Tree of Life, and VitalSource Technologies, Inc. MBS Wholesale competes with Amazon, BBA Solutions, Follett Corporation, IndiCo, Nebraska Book Company, and Texas Book Company. Competitors that compete with our general merchandise offerings include Fanatics, Sodexo & Aramark, online retailers, and physical and online office supply stores. Students often purchase from multiple textbook providers, are highly price sensitive, and can easily shift spending from one provider or format to another. As a consequence, in addition to being competitive in the services we provide to our customers, our textbook business faces significant price competition. Some of our competitors have adopted, and may continue to adopt, aggressive pricing policies and devote substantial resources to marketing, website and systems development. In addition, a variety of business models are being pursued for the provision of print and digital textbooks, some of which may be more profitable or successful than our business model. Furthermore, the market for course materials is diluted from counterfeiting and piracy of digital and print copies or illegal copies of selected chapters made by students or others; user and faculty created content; and sharing or non-purchase of required course materials by students.\nWe may not be able to enter into new managed bookstore contracts or successfully retain or renew our managed bookstore contracts on profitable terms.\nAn important part of our business strategy for both BNC and MBS Direct is to expand sales for our college bookstore operations by being awarded additional contracts to manage physical and/or online bookstores for colleges and universities, and private/parochial K-12 schools, across the United States. Our ability to obtain those additional contracts is subject to a number of factors that we are not able to control. In addition, the anticipated strategic benefits of new and additional college and university bookstores may not be realized at all or may not be realized within the time frames contemplated by management. In particular for BNC\u2019s operation of physical bookstores, contracts for additional managed stores may involve a number of special risks, including adverse short-term effects on operating results, diversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources, standardization of accounting systems, dependence on retaining, hiring and training key personnel, unanticipated problems or legal liabilities, and actions of our competitors and customers. Because certain terms of any contract are generally fixed for the initial term of the contract and involve judgments and estimates that may not be accurate, including for reasons outside of our control, we have contracts that are not profitable and may have such contracts in the future. The retail price charged to the consumer for textbooks is set by our contracts with colleges and universities to be a maximum markup based on the publishers\u2019 costs and if prices were reduced by publishers, it could negatively impact our revenues and margin. Even if we have the right to terminate a contract, we may be reluctant to do so even when a contract is unprofitable due to, among other factors, the potential effect on our reputation.\nIn addition, we may face significant competition in retaining existing physical and online store contracts and when renewing those contracts as they expire. Our BNC contracts are typically for five years with renewal options, but can range from one to 15 years, and most contracts are cancelable by either party without penalty with 90 to 120 days' notice. Our MBS Direct contracts are typically for three to five years and most are cancellable without penalty with notice. Despite the lower startup and ongoing\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\noperating expense associated with online stores, the loss of such contracts could impact revenue and profitability. We may not be successful in retaining our current contracts, renewing our current contracts or renewing our current contracts on terms that provide us the opportunity to improve or maintain the profitability of managing stores that are the subject matter of such contracts.\nWe face the risk of disruption of supplier relationships and/or supply chain and/or inventory surplus.\nThe retail products that we sell and products for the MBS wholesale business originate from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. During Fiscal 2017, BNC\u2019s four largest retail suppliers, including MBS, accounted for approximately 42% of our merchandise purchased, with the largest supplier accounting for approximately 17% of our merchandise purchased. MBS Wholesale sources over 80% of its inventory from two primary channels, approximately 50% from retail bookstores (including BNC) and approximately 32% from third party suppliers. While we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good, suppliers may modify the terms of these relationships due to general economic conditions or otherwise or, especially with respect to wholesale inventory, publishers could terminate distribution to wholesalers such as MBS.\nWe do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content or services, particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop selling merchandise, content or services to us on acceptable terms, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, we may be unable to procure the same merchandise, content or services from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Furthermore, certain of our merchandise is sourced indirectly from outside the United States. Political or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, natural disasters, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of foreign-sourced merchandise.\nIn addition, our retail and wholesale businesses are dependent on the continued supply of textbooks. The publishing industry generally has suffered recently due to, among other things, changing consumer preferences away from the print medium and the economic climate. A significant disruption in this industry generally or a significant unfavorable change in our relationships with key suppliers could adversely impact our business. In addition, any significant change in the terms that we have with our key suppliers including, purchase or rental general terms, payment terms, return policies, the discount or margin on products or changes to the distribution model of textbooks, could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. For example, some textbook publishers have proposed to supply textbooks on consignment terms, instead of selling to us, which would eliminate those titles from the used textbook inventory supply. With respect to the business of MBS Wholesale, the demand for used and new textbooks is typically greater than the available supply, and MBS is highly dependent upon its ability to build its textbook inventory from publishers and suppliers in advance of the selling season. These relationships are not generally governed by long-term contracts and publishers and suppliers could choose not to sell to MBS. Any negative impact on MBS's ability to build its textbook inventory could have an adverse impact on financial results.\nIn addition, we have significantly increased our textbook rental business, offering students a lower cost alternative to purchasing textbooks, which is also subject to certain inventory risks, such as textbooks not being resold or re-rented due to textbooks being returned late or in poor condition, faculty members not continuing to adopt or use certain textbooks, or, as discussed above, changes in the way publishers supply textbooks to us.\nOur results also depend on the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives. We may not be able to implement these strategies successfully, on a timely basis, or at all.\nOur ability to grow depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to implement our strategic initiatives to retain and expand existing customer relationships, acquire new accounts, expand sales channels and marketing efforts, develop and market higher education digital products and adapt to changing industry trends. While we believe we have the capital resources, experience, management resources and internal systems to successfully operate our business, we may not be successful in implementing these strategies. The implementation of our digital strategy is a complex process and relies on leveraging our core products, services and relationships to help accelerate the adoption of our new digital products and services. Success of our future operating results will be dependent upon rapid customer adoption of our new digital products and services and our ability to scale our business to meet customer demand appropriately. If colleges and universities, faculty and students are not receptive to our new products and services or our new products and services do not meet the expectations of these constituencies, there could be a negative impact on the implementation of our strategy. To successfully execute on this strategy, we need to continue to further evolve the focus of our organization towards the delivery of cost effective and unique solutions for our customers. Any failure to successfully execute this strategy could adversely affect our operating results. Further, even if successfully implemented, our business strategy may not ultimately produce positive results.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nWe may not achieve the strategic objectives, anticipated synergies, and/or other expected potential benefits of the recent acquisition of MBS Textbook Exchange, LLC.\nWe recently announced the acquisition of MBS Textbook Exchange, LLC (\u201cMBS\u201d). MBS is the largest contract operator of virtual bookstores for the institutional client market and one of the largest textbook wholesalers in the U.S. We expect to realize strategic and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the acquisition of MBS, including leveraging MBS\u2019s wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems to enable BNC to optimize its textbook sourcing, purchasing and liquidation processes, and increasing sales of product offerings through relationships with MBS customers. However, we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which these benefits will actually be achieved or the timing of any such benefits. The following factors, among others, may prevent us from realizing these benefits:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to leverage additional sales from the expanded customer base;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to retain key employees; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to integrate the business of MBS in an efficient and effective manner.\nIn addition, the integration process could also take longer than we anticipate and could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefits it anticipates.\nMBS Wholesale may not be able to manage its inventory levels effectively which may lead to excess inventory or inventory obsolescence.\nMBS Wholesale sources new textbooks from publishers and new and used textbooks from other suppliers to resell to its customers. If it is unable to appropriately manage its inventory and anticipate the release of new editions of titles, faculty\u2019s change in choice of titles, return rate, or use of alternative educational material, MBS Wholesale could be exposed to risks of excess inventory and less marketable or obsolete inventory. This may lead to excess or obsolete inventory which might have to be sold at a deep discount impacting its revenues and profit margin and may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategy includes pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships and we may not be able to identify and successfully complete such transactions.\nIn addition to the MBS acquisition, as part of our strategy, we have acquired, and, may in the future acquire, businesses or business operations, or enter into other business transactions, such as our acquisition of LoudCloud Systems, Inc. and strategic commercial agreement with Vital Source Technologies, Inc. We may not be able to identify suitable candidates for additional business combinations and strategic investments, obtain financing on acceptable terms for such transactions, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, if any, or otherwise consummate such transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we compete for acquisitions with other potential acquirers, some of which may have greater financial or operational resources than we do. This competition may increase costs of acquiring desirable businesses, and, as a result, we may be unable to make acquisitions or be forced to pay more or agree to less advantageous acquisition terms for the businesses that we are able to acquire. Any strategic acquisitions or investments that we are able to identify and complete may also involve a number of risks, including our inability to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees; the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing business to integrate operations and personnel; possible material adverse effects on our results of operations during the integration process; becoming subject to contingent or other liabilities, including liabilities arising from events or conduct predating the acquisition that were not known to us at the time of the acquisition; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction, including the inability to achieve cost savings and synergies. Acquisitions may also have unanticipated tax, legal, regulatory and accounting ramifications, including recording goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges and incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets.\nOur business is dependent on the overall economic environment, college enrollment and consumer spending patterns.\nA deterioration of the current economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results, as well as our ability to fund our growth and strategic business initiatives. Our business is affected by funding levels at colleges and universities and by changes in enrollments at colleges and universities, changes in student enrollments and lower spending on textbooks and general merchandise. The growth of our business depends on our ability to attract new students and to increase the level of engagement by existing students. To the extent we are unable to attract new students or students spend less generally, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business relies on certain key personnel.\nManagement believes that our continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of certain of our key personnel. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance on any of our officers or other employees.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nOur business is seasonal.\nOur retail business is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second and third fiscal quarters, when college students generally purchase textbooks for the upcoming semesters, and lowest in the first and fourth fiscal quarters. Sales attributable to the MBS wholesale business are generally highest in our first, second and third quarter as it sells textbooks for retail distribution, which somewhat offsets the decreased first quarter sales attributable to our retail business. Less than satisfactory net sales during our peak fiscal quarters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results for the year, and our results of operations from those quarters may not be sufficient to cover any losses that may be incurred in the other fiscal quarters of the year.\nOur international operations could result in additional risks.\nHistorically, our operations have been limited to the United States; however, we contract with service providers outside the United States and we recently have acquired operations in India (and we may continue to expand internationally). Such international expansion may result in additional risks that are not present domestically and which could adversely affect our business or our results of operations, including compliance with additional United States regulations and those of other nations applicable to international operations; cultural and language differences; currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, which are harder to predict in the current adverse global economic climate; restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; potentially adverse tax consequences and limitations on our ability to utilize losses generated in our foreign operations; different regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business; and different or less stable political and economic environments. Further, conducting business abroad subjects us to increased regulatory compliance and oversight. For example, in connection with our international operations, we are subject to laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in regulatory enforcement actions as well as substantial civil and criminal penalties assessed against us and our employees.\nWe face data security risks with respect to personal information.\nOur business involves the receipt, storage, processing and transmission of personal information about customers and employees. We may share information about such persons with vendors and third parties that assist with certain aspects of our business. Also, in connection with our student financial aid platform and the processing of university debit cards, we secure and have access to certain student personal information that has been provided to us by the universities we serve. Our handling and use of personal information is regulated at the international, federal and state levels and by industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. As an entity that provides services to institutions of higher education, we are contractually bound to handle certain personal information from student education records in accordance with the requirements of Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d). Privacy and information security laws, regulations, and industry standards change from time to time, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new processes and may be difficult to achieve. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations and standards, we could be subjected to legal risk. In addition, even if we fully comply with all laws, regulations and standards, and even though we have taken significant steps to protect personal information, we could experience a data security breach, and our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in a material breach of contract with one or more of our clients, lost future sales or decreased usage of credit and debit card products. Further, in the event that we disclose student information in violation of FERPA, the U.S. Department of Education could require a client to suspend our access to their student information for at least five years. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our users\u2019 proprietary information and cause interruption in our operations. Any compromise of our data security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage, increased operating costs associated with remediation, equipment acquisitions or disposal and added personnel, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business or affect investor confidence. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, actions by an employee.\nComputer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data. Our computer systems may be vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion, ransomware and random attack. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of service, social engineering, ransomware and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our key business partners face similar risks, and a security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. While we continue to invest data protection and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nLaws or regulations may be enacted which restrict or prohibit use of emails or similar marketing activities that we currently rely on.\nOur marketing efforts are centered around an active digital community, which includes engaged email subscribers and our continuous dialogue with customers on our school-customized social media channels. For example, the following laws and regulations may apply:\n\u2022the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states regulate unsolicited commercial emails, create civil and criminal penalties for emails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online marketing practices; and\n\u2022the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has guidelines that impose responsibilities on companies with respect to communications with consumers and impose fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respect to advertising or marketing practices they may deem misleading or deceptive.\nEven if no relevant law or regulation is enacted, we may discontinue use or support of these activities if we become concerned that students or potential students deem them intrusive or they otherwise adversely affect our goodwill and brand. If our marketing activities are curtailed, our ability to attract new students may be adversely affected.\nOur business could be impacted by changes in federal, state, local or international laws, rules or regulations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws relating to all aspects of our business. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, our access to student financial aid, pricing and availability of educational materials, competition and/or antitrust, content, copyrights, distribution, college distribution, mobile communications, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services, unencumbered Internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, digital content (including governmental investigations and litigation relating to the agency pricing model for digital content distribution), the characteristics and quality of products and services and labor and employee benefits (including the costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or any legislation enacted in connection with repeal of the Affordable Care Act). Changes in federal, state, local or international laws, rules or regulations relating to these matters could increase regulatory compliance requirements in addition to increasing our costs of doing business or otherwise impact our business. For example, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws could raise the wage requirements for certain of our employees at our retail locations, which would increase our selling costs and may cause us to reexamine our wage structure for such employees.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations might adversely impact our businesses or financial performance.\nWe collected sales tax on the majority of the products and services that we sold in our respective prior fiscal years that were subject to sales tax, and we generally have continued the same policies for sales tax within the current fiscal year. While management believes that the financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K reflect management\u2019s best current estimate of any potential additional sales tax liability based on current discussions with taxing authorities, we cannot assure you that the outcome of any discussions with any taxing authority will not result in the payment of sales taxes for prior periods or otherwise, or that the amount of any such payments will not be materially in excess of any liability currently recorded. In the future, our businesses may be subject to claims for not collecting sales tax on the products and services we currently sell for which sales tax is not collected. In addition, our provision for income taxes and our obligation to pay income tax is based on existing federal, state and local tax laws. Changes to these laws, in particular as they relate to depreciation, amortization and cost of goods sold, could have a significant impact on our income tax provision, our projected cash tax liability, or both.\nOur expansion into new products, services and technologies subjects us to additional business, legal, financial and competitive risks.\nWe may require additional capital in the future to sustain or grow our business. Our gross profits and margins in our newer activities may be lower than in our traditional activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. In addition, we may have limited or no experience in our newer products and services, and our customers may not adopt our new product or service offerings. Some of these offerings may present new and difficult technological challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues.\nWe are dependent upon access to the capital markets, bank credit facilities, and short-term vendor financing for liquidity needs.\nWe must have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund working capital requirements. We believe that the combination of cash-on-hand, cash flow received from operations, funds available under our revolving senior credit facility and short-term vendor financing will be sufficient to meet our normal working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. If these sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, and the availability of credit. These factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing, and our financial position and results of operations would be adversely impacted. Volatility in global financial markets may also limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nlike, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions. Accordingly, if the economy worsens, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely upon third party web service providers to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with such services would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.\nAmazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) and other third party web service providers provide a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a \u201ccloud\u201d computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities, and other services provided by AWS and other providers. Any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS or other third party service providers would impact our operations and our business would be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe rely heavily on proprietary technology to process deliveries and returns of the textbooks and to manage other aspects of our operations.\nWe, primarily through our subsidiary MBS, use a proprietary system to source, distribute and manage inventory of textbooks and to manage other aspects of our operations, including systems to consider the market pricing for textbooks, general availability of textbook titles and other factors to determine how to buy textbooks and set prices for textbooks and other content in real time. MBS has invested significant amounts of resources in the hardware and software to develop this system. We rely on the expertise of our engineering and software development teams to maintain and enhance the equipment and software used for our distribution operations. We cannot be sure that the maintenance and enhancements we make to our distribution operations will achieve the intended results or otherwise be of value to students. If we are unable to maintain and enhance our technology to manage textbook sourcing, distribution and inventory, it could disrupt our business operation and have a material adverse impact on our results.\nDefects, errors, installation difficulties or performance issues with our point-of-sales and other systems could expose us to potential liability, harm our reputation and negatively impact our business.\nMBS sells and services point-of-sales systems to its college bookstore customers. These systems are complex and incorporate third-party hardware and software. Despite testing and quality control, we cannot be certain that defects or errors will not be found in these systems. In addition, because these systems are installed in different environments, we may experience difficulty or delay in installation. Our products may be integrated with other components or software, and, in the event that there are defects or errors, it may be difficult to determine the origin of defects or errors. Additionally, any difficulty or failure in the operation of these systems could cause business disruption for MBS\u2019 customers. If any of these risks materialize, they could result in additional costs and expenses, exposure to liability claims, diversion of technical and other resources to engage in remediation efforts, loss of customers or negative publicity, each of which could impact our business and operating results.\nOur MBS subsidiary relies on a sophisticated system for warehousing and distribution of the vast majority of our textbooks and any material failure of that system could impair our ability to operate our businesses.\nMBS is dependent on sophisticated equipment and related software technology for the warehousing and distribution of the vast majority of textbooks supplied to us and others located at MBS\u2019 facility in Columbia, Missouri. MBS\u2019 ability to efficiently manage its business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, especially if such events were to occur during peak periods, could adversely affect our operation, the ability to serve our customers and our results of operations. In addition, substantially all of MBS\u2019 inventory is located in the Columbia warehouse facility. We could experience significant interruption in the operation of this facility or damage or destruction of our inventory due to physical damage to the facility caused by natural disasters, accidents or otherwise. If a material portion of our inventory were to be damaged or destroyed, we would likely incur significant financial loss, including loss of revenue and harm to our customer relationships.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, domain name regulations, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights, including our use of the Barnes & Noble trademark. Laws and regulations may not adequately protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary or licensed rights.\nWe may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nmisappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\nOther parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. Because of the changes in Internet commerce and digital content businesses, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others.\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, we could be subject to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\nIn addition, the publishing industry has been, and we expect in the future will continue to be, the target of counterfeiting and piracy. While we have in place anti-counterfeit policies and procedures (which include removing from distribution suspected counterfeit titles) for preventing the proliferation of counterfeit textbooks, we may inadvertently purchase counterfeit textbooks which may unknowingly be included in the textbooks we offer for sale or rent to students or we may purchase such textbooks through our buyback program. As such, we may be subject to allegations of selling counterfeit books. We have in the past and may continue to receive communications from publishers alleging that certain textbooks sold or rented by us are counterfeit. When receiving such communications, we cooperate, and will continue to cooperate in the future, with such publishers in identifying fraudulent textbooks and removing them from our inventory. We may implement measures in an effort to protect against these potential liabilities that could require us to spend substantial resources. Any costs incurred as a result of liability or asserted liability relating to sales of counterfeit textbooks could harm our business, reputation and financial condition.\nLegal proceedings may significantly harm our business.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other proceedings in the ordinary course of business. It is possible that such litigation or proceedings may significantly harm our future results of operations or financial condition due to expenses we may incur to defend ourselves or the ramifications of an adverse decision.\nWe do not own the Barnes & Noble trademark and instead rely on a license of that trademark and certain other trademarks, which license imposes limits on what those trademarks can be used to do.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, Barnes & Noble, Inc. granted us an exclusive, perpetual, fully paid up, non-transferable and non-assignable license to use the trademarks \u201cBarnes & Noble College,\u201d \u201cB&N College,\u201d \u201cBarnes & Noble Education\u201d and \u201cB&N Education\u201d and the non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paid up, non-transferable and non-assignable license to use the marks \u201cBarnes & Noble,\u201d \u201cB&N\u201d and \u201cBN,\u201d solely in connection with the contract management of college and university bookstores and other bookstores associated with academic institutions and related websites, as well as education products and services (including digital education products and services) and related websites. These restrictions may materially limit our ability to use the licensed marks in the expansion of our operations in the future. In addition, we are reliant on Barnes & Noble, Inc. to maintain the licensed trademarks.\nWe rely on third-party digital content and applications, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe contract with certain third-parties to offer their digital content. Our licensing arrangements with these third-parties do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for us to license our content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit our access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. If we are unable to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Spin-Off from Barnes & Noble, Inc.\nWe could have an indemnification obligation to Barnes & Noble, Inc. if the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition treatment.\nIf, due to any of our covenants in the Tax Matters Agreement being breached, it were determined as a tax matter that the Spin-Off did not qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, we could be required to indemnify Barnes & Noble, Inc. for the resulting taxes and related expenses. In addition, Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), generally creates a presumption that the Spin-Off would be taxable to Barnes & Noble, Inc., but not to holders, if we or our stockholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change by vote or value in the ownership of our stock during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the Spin-Off, unless it were established that such transactions and the Spin-Off were not part of a plan or series of related transactions giving effect to such a change in ownership. If the Spin-Off were taxable to Barnes & Noble, Inc. due to such 50% or greater change in the ownership of our stock, Barnes & Noble, Inc. would have to recognize gain in an amount up to the fair market value of our stock held by it immediately before the\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nSpin-Off, and we generally would be required to indemnify Barnes & Noble, Inc. for the tax on such gain and related expenses. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Agreements with Barnes & Noble-Tax Matters Agreement\u201d in our Prospectus dated July 15, 2015 and filed with SEC on that date for more information.\nWe have agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the Spin-Off, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nWe have agreed in the Tax Matters Agreement to covenants and indemnification obligations that address compliance with Section 355(e) of the Code. These covenants and indemnification obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that might maximize the value of our business, and could discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our stockholders may consider favorable. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Agreements with Barnes & Noble-Tax Matters Agreement\u201d in our Prospectus dated July 15, 2015 and filed with SEC on that date for more information.\nWe have limited operating history as an independent publicly-traded company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent publicly-traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nWe derived certain historical financial information for the period prior to the Spin-Off included in this Form 10-K from Barnes & Noble, Inc.\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position we would have achieved as an independent publicly-traded company during the periods presented (prior to the Spin-Off) or those that we will achieve in the future. Prior to the Spin-Off, we operated as part of Barnes & Noble, Inc.\u2019s broader corporate organization, and Barnes & Noble, Inc. performed various corporate functions for us. Our historical financial information reflects allocations of corporate expenses from Barnes & Noble, Inc. for these and similar functions. These allocations do not necessarily reflect the costs we now incur for similar services as an independent publicly-traded company.\nFor additional information about our past financial performance and the basis of presentation of our financial statements, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Part II - Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\nWe may have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with Barnes & Noble, Inc..\nWe entered into agreements with Barnes & Noble, Inc. related to our separation from Barnes & Noble, Inc., including the Separation Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, the Trademark License Agreement and Employee Matters Agreement, while we were still part of Barnes & Noble, Inc.. Accordingly, these agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arms-length negotiations between unaffiliated parties. The terms of the agreements relate to, among other things, allocations of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations between Barnes & Noble, Inc. and us. We may have received better terms from third parties than we received from Barnes & Noble, Inc. because third parties would have competed with each other to win our business, but we are now bound by the terms of the agreements we entered into with Barnes & Noble. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u201d in our Prospectus dated July 15, 2015 and filed with SEC on that date for more information.\nWe are dependent on Barnes & Noble, Inc. to provide certain services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nAlthough we have developed the capabilities to handle certain corporate and administrative services such as information technology and financial, we will continue to rely on Barnes & Noble, Inc. to provide Human Resources Information Systems pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement until we provide such services from unaffiliated third parties. If Barnes & Noble, Inc. is unable or unwilling to provide such services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, or if the agreement is terminated prior to the end of its term, we may be unable to provide such services ourselves or we may have to incur additional expenditures to obtain such services from another provider. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we were granted access to Barnes & Noble, Inc.\u2019s product procurement and merchandising systems for a perpetual period of time unless a termination event occurs. These systems provide inventory management and buying for BNC\u2019s trade books. In the event these systems no longer operated or were otherwise not available to BNC, BNC would incur substantial expense replicating these systems.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our Common Stock may trade. The market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our businesses;\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies, including our digital education initiative;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industries;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our Common Stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our Company and the college bookstore industry;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nThe concentration of our Common Stock ownership may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and may involve other risks.\nA portion of our Common Stock is controlled by a few stockholders. This control may limit the ability of the Company\u2019s other stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions with which our other stockholders do not agree.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, any return on your investment in our Common Stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. We expect to retain future earnings, if any, for reinvestment in our business. Also, our credit agreements may restrict our ability to pay dividends. Whether we pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects and any other factors our Board deems relevant. Therefore, any return on your investment in our Common Stock must come from increases in the fair market value and trading price of our Common Stock. For more information, see Part II - Item 5. Market for Registrants - Dividends.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect to grant to our directors, officers and other employees. We have an incentive plan that provides for the grant of Common Stock-based equity awards to our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, we may issue equity as all or part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and strategic investments that we may make in the future or as necessary to finance our ongoing operations.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated By-laws contain provisions which, together with applicable Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable, including provisions that:\n\u2022\ndivide our Board into three staggered classes of directors that are each elected to three-year terms;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by or at the direction of a majority of our Board or the chairman of our Board; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominations.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nThese provisions may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of the Company, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their Common Stock at a price above the prevailing market price. See \u201cDescription of Our Capital Stock-Certain Provisions of Delaware Law, Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws\u201d in our Prospectus dated July 15, 2015 and filed with SEC on that date for more information.\nOur Amended and Restated By-laws designate courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Amended and Restated By-laws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, the state and federal courts of the State of Delaware are the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated By-laws or (d) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.\nAlternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Amended and Restated By-laws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 15489, "SIC": 5940, "TIC": "BNED"}
