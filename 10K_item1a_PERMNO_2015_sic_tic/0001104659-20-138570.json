Risk Factors.\nEach reader should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, because they could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, prospects, and the value of an investment in IS&S common stock.\nSummary\nAn investment in our common stock involves various risks, including risks related to the items listed below. However, you are urged to carefully consider all of the matters discussed in this Part I, Item 1A of this Report under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d (not just those discussed in this summary) in considering our business and prospects.\nIS&S-Specific Risk Factors\nThe Company faces risks relating to:\n\u00b7 continued market acceptance of the Company\u2019s air data systems and other products;\n\u00b7 the deferral or termination of programs or contracts for convenience by customers;\n\u00b7 the potential for losses due to cost overruns on fixed-price contract projects;\n\u00b7 U.S. federal government budget deficits and audit practices, including the possibility of reductions in government expenditures;\n\u00b7 the possibility that IS&S may lose one or more key customers;\n\u00b7 the self-insured portion of IS&S\u2019 employee medical insurance program;\n\u00b7 our lack of substantial backlog;\n\u00b7 the ability to service the international market; and\n\u00b7 intense competition with key competitors.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company faces risks relating to:\n\u00b7 the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u00b7 the ability to respond to technological change;\n\u00b7 delays in receiving components from third-party suppliers;\n\u00b7 challenges associated with the complexity of our products;\n\u00b7 our ability to protect our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 failure to retain/recruit key personnel;\n\u00b7 succession planning;\n\u00b7 variations in our revenue and operating results over time;\n\u00b7 a cyber security incident;\n\u00b7 potential litigation;\n\u00b7 the costs of compliance with present and future laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 changes in law, including changes to corporate tax laws in the United States and the availability of certain tax credits;\n\u00b7 Brexit;\n\u00b7 volatility and weakness in capital markets; and\n\u00b7 the efficacy of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIS&S-Specific Risk Factors\nGrowth of the Company\u2019s customer base could be limited by delays or difficulties in completing development and introduction of planned products or product enhancements. If IS&S fails to enhance existing products, or to develop and achieve market acceptance for flat panel displays, flight management systems, autothrottle technology and other new products that meet customer requirements, its business, reputation and statements of income may be affected adversely.\nCurrently, IS&S spends a large portion of its R&D efforts in developing and marketing the FPDS, FMS, ThrustSense\u00ae Autothrottle and complementary products. The Company\u2019s ability to grow and diversify its operations through introduction and sale of new products is dependent upon its continued success in product development and engineering activities, its sales and marketing efforts, and its ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals to sell such products. Sales growth will depend in part on market acceptance of and demand for the FPDS, FMS, ThrustSense\u00ae Autothrottle and future products. IS&S cannot be certain that it will be able to develop, introduce or market its FPDS, FMS, ThrustSense\u00ae Autothrottle or other new products or product enhancements in a timely or cost-effective manner, or that any new products or product enhancements will receive market acceptance or necessary regulatory approval. In addition, the Company\u2019s business is dependent upon maintaining its reputation and relationships with existing customers. If the Company\u2019s performance does not meet its customers\u2019 expectations, the Company\u2019s reputation and its relationships could be damaged, which may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and statements of income, including reductions in sales.\nIn seeking new customers, the Company may have difficulty in displacing the products of incumbent competitors. IS&S cannot be assured that potential customers will accept its products or that existing customers will not abandon them.\nContracts can be terminated by many of the Company\u2019s customers at any time and, therefore, may not result in sales.\nIS&S\u2019s contracts, including contracts with government agencies, includes various terms and conditions that impose certain requirements on IS&S, including the ability of the government agency or general contractor to alter the price, quantity or delivery schedule of the products. Additionally, government agencies and general contractors typically retain the right to terminate the contract at any time at their convenience. Upon alteration or termination of these contracts, IS&S is entitled typically to an equitable adjustment to the contract price so that it would be compensated for delivered items and allowable costs incurred. However, because these contracts can be terminated for convenience, the Company cannot be assured that its backlog will result in sales.\nThe Company enters into fixed-price contracts or service arrangements to perform specified design and EDC services related to its products that could subject IS&S to losses in the event the Company incurs cost overruns on its projects.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, approximately 4% percent of the Company\u2019s total sales were from fixed-price EDC arrangements with customers to perform specified design and EDC services related to its products. These arrangements allow IS&S to benefit by recovering some of its product development costs, but it carries the risk of potential cost overruns. If the Company\u2019s initial cost estimates are incorrect, it can incur potentially large one time charges and losses on these contracts. These EDC arrangements can expose the Company to potential losses because the customer may compel IS&S to complete a project or, in the event of a termination for default, pay the incremental cost of its replacement by another provider. Because some of these projects involve new technologies and applications, and can last for more than a year, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with subcontractors, and cost overruns can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to IS&S over time. Furthermore, if the Company does not meet project deadlines or if its products do not meet customer specifications, it may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages, or suffer losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. The Company\u2019s results of operations are dependent on its ability to maximize earnings from the EDC service arrangements. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nA portion of IS&S sales come from government contracts, which could be adversely affected by continued high U.S. federal budget deficits. Government contracts are also subject to special risks as a result of the U.S. government\u2019s audit practices.\nA portion of IS&S sales has been, and is expected to continue to be, from defense contractors or government agencies in connection with government aircraft retrofit or OEM contracts. Sales to government contractors and government agencies could decline as a result of DoD spending cuts and general budgetary constraints which may become more severe as the federal budget deficit remains high.\nIn addition, the U.S. government regularly conducts investigations, inquiries and audits into its suppliers\u2019 compliance with procurement regulations and performance under the relevant government contracts. If an investigation reveals or an audit finds that the Company violated applicable law or regulations, its government contracts could be terminated and it could be restricted from future procurement activities. Moreover, if an investigation, inquiry or audit finds that the Company acted improperly or was involved in illegal activities, the Company could be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, and administrative sanctions. As a result, the Company\u2019s reputation could be harmed even if the allegations were later determined to be false.\nReductions in government expenditures could adversely affect IS&S business.\nReductions in funding of the DoD and U.S. defense spending could have significant consequences to the Company\u2019s business and industry. While the full impact of such reductions is not determinable, the impact of any resulting reductions in defense appropriations, and/or reductions in U.S. defense spending could result in delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and negatively affect the IS&S\u2019s revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of a key customer or a significant deterioration in the financial condition of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue is concentrated with a limited number of customers. During fiscal year 2020 IS&S derived 63% of revenue from the top five customers. IS&S expects a relatively small number of customers to account for a majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result of the concentrated customer base, a loss of one or more of these customers or a dispute or litigation with one of these key customers could affect adversely its revenue and results of operations. The Company monitors and evaluates the credit status of its customers and attempts to adjust sales terms as appropriate. Despite these efforts, a significant deterioration in the financial condition or bankruptcy filing of a key customer could affect adversely the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to credit risk associated with the concentration of accounts receivable from its key customers. If any of the Company\u2019s top customers were to become bankrupt or insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the products and services provided by the Company, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their businesses or financial conditions, then the Company may incur significant write-offs of accounts receivable, incur other impairment charges or result in a significant loss of expected revenues, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nWe self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance program, which may expose us to unpredictable costs and negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance program and related benefit claims. The estimated liability for the self-funded portion of our insurance program is determined actuarially, based on claims filed historically, demographic factors and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. We maintain stop loss insurance coverage to limit our exposure for the self-funded portion of our health insurance program both on a per employee and aggregate basis, and liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions or management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the premiums for this coverage could increase in the future, or we could be forced to raise our self-insured retention amounts. If these expenses increase, or if we experience a claim in excess of our reserve and/or coverage limits, it could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe currently operate without a substantial backlog.\nDuring periods of economic uncertainty, the rate of customer orders can quickly decrease, and a substantial backlog may help promote greater efficiency in production, facilitate business planning and improve revenue visibility. As of September 30, 2020, none of the Company\u2019s backlog was expected to be filled beyond fiscal 2021, which is below the Company\u2019s historical expectations and may result in lower revenues in future periods. As a result, future revenue will be dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter, and may not be predictable with any degree of certainty. Furthermore, certain contracts may represent a significant portion of our revenue and profits for a quarter such that the loss or deferral of even one such contract could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nThe Company has limited experience in marketing and distributing its products internationally.\nIS&S plans to derive increasing revenues from sales outside the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia. Risks inherent in doing business internationally include:\n\u00b7 differing regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 legal uncertainty regarding liability and the enforceability of agreements;\n\u00b7 tariffs, trade and investment barriers, and other regulatory barriers;\n\u00b7 political and economic instability, including changes in government budgets;\n\u00b7 changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u00b7 failure by our employees or agents to comply with U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended;\n\u00b7 difficulty with staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u00b7 the impact of recessions in economies outside the United States; and\n\u00b7 variances and unexpected changes in local laws and regulations.\nCurrently, all of the Company\u2019s international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. An increase in the dollar\u2019s value compared to other currencies could render the Company\u2019s products less competitive in the international markets. In the future, IS&S may be required to conduct sales in the foreign country\u2019s local currency, thus exposing it to fluctuations and volatility in exchange rates that could adversely affect its operating results. Further, as we pursue customers in Asia and other less developed markets throughout the world, our potential inability to ensure the creditworthiness of counterparties could impose additional risks and affect our overall profitability. Emerging market operations in particular can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls.\nWhile these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s competition includes other manufacturers of air data systems and flight information displays against whom it may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Competitors include Honeywell International Inc., Collins Aerospace, Thales Defense & Security, Inc., Garmin Ltd. and GE Aviation Systems. All these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than does IS&S. In addition, these competitors have much greater experience in and resources for marketing their products. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer preferences, or to devote greater resources to development, promotion and sale of their products than IS&S can. The Company\u2019s competitors may have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases. Such competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect IS&S.\nThe ongoing global outbreak of coronavirus, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 and a national emergency by the President of the United States on March 13, 2020, has caused and is continuing to cause business slowdowns and shutdowns and turmoil in the financial markets both in the United States and abroad. IS&S is monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, including how it has impacted and will impact the Company\u2019s employees, customers, suppliers and distribution channels. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the quarantines and other governmental and non-governmental restrictions that have been imposed throughout the world in an effort to contain or mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption which may adversely affect IS&S\u2019 business and has caused and is continuing to cause significant market turbulence and disruption that may continue for some time even after business restrictions are lifted and the threat of the coronavirus diminishes. For example, governmental authorities in several jurisdictions have recently implemented or reimplemented orders mandating the cessation of all business activity that is deemed non-essential and, although the Company\u2019s business has to date been deemed essential in many affected markets, there is a risk that these shutdown orders will be extended or expanded or that similar shutdown orders will be implemented in other regions.\nWhile the Company has not yet seen a material impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, financial position, liquidity, or ability to service customers or maintain critical operations, the nature and magnitude of this unprecedented crisis\u2019 ultimate impact on the Company will depend on numerous evolving factors, future developments and cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that the Company is not able to predict, including: the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the international actions and business restrictions that are being undertaken and implemented as a result of it; governmental, business and other responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the promotion of \u201csocial distancing,\u201d the issuance of shelter in place orders and restrictions on the Company\u2019s operations, and the possibility that government officials may mandate that the Company provide products or services; the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly delay the issuance of required government approvals, including necessary certifications from the FAA; potential disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chain; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s ability to execute its short term and long-term business strategies and initiatives; the extent to which forced remote working arrangements reduce the Company\u2019s ability to manage its business effectively; the extent to which staffing shortages due to members of the Company\u2019s workforce being quarantined or exposed to the coronavirus may be detrimental to the Company\u2019s operations; and the possibility that federal or state governments (including government agencies such as the Treasury Department, the Small Business Administration or the SEC) could promulgate new statutes, regulations, guidance or relief measures, or rescind or modify existing statutes, regulations, guidance or relief measures, in a way that is detrimental to the Company or its business in light of the Company\u2019s prior Paycheck Protection Program loan.\nIn addition, while the Company cannot predict the magnitude of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its customers and suppliers or their financial conditions, any material effect on the Company\u2019s customers or suppliers could adversely impact the Company. For example, the Company\u2019s customers or suppliers may themselves assert, or attempt to terminate various agreements and arrangements with us on the basis of, contractual force majeure provisions, and any termination of a significant commercial agreement may adversely harm our operations. Earlier in the 2020 fiscal year, certain of the Company\u2019s customers temporarily suspended product deliveries as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and while these deliveries subsequently resumed, there is a possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in other suspensions, delays or order cancellations by the Company\u2019s customers or suppliers. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and related travel restrictions and other containment efforts have had a significant impact on the travel industry, which may result in reduced demand for products in the general aviation and commercial air transport markets and therefore for the Company\u2019s products and systems. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risk factors described under this Part I, Item 1A of this Report, any of which could have a material effect on the Company. For example, the risks associated with potential cybersecurity threats may be magnified given that many of the Company\u2019s employees are currently working remotely using personal electronic devices and home internet connections.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. At this point, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its overall impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nIf IS&S is unable to respond to rapid technological change, its products could become obsolete and its reputation could suffer.\nFuture generations of flat panel displays, air data systems, engine and fuel displays, flight management systems and autothrottle technology which embody new technologies or new industry standards could render the Company\u2019s products obsolete. The market for aviation products is subject to rapid technological change, new product introductions, changes in customer preferences, and evolving industry standards and government regulations. The Company\u2019s future success will depend on its ability to:\n\u00b7 embrace rapidly changing technologies;\n\u00b7 adapt the Company\u2019s products to evolving industry standards and government regulations; and\n\u00b7 develop and introduce timely, high-quality, cost effective new products and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers.\nIf IS&S fails to modify or improve its products in response to evolving industry standards and government regulations, its products could rapidly become obsolete.\nThe Company\u2019s products are currently subject to direct regulation by the FAA and other equivalent organizations. The Company\u2019s products, as they relate to aircraft applications, must be approved by the FAA, EASA, or other equivalent organizations before they can be installed in an aircraft. To be certified, IS&S must demonstrate that its products are accurate and able to maintain certain levels of repeatability over time. Although the certification requirements of the FAA and EASA are substantially similar, no formal reciprocity exists between the two regulators. Accordingly, even though the Company\u2019s products are FAA approved, the Company may need to obtain approval from EASA or other appropriate organizations to have them certified for installation outside the United States.\nSignificant delay in receiving certification for newly developed products or enhancements to the Company\u2019s products, or the loss of certification for its existing products, could result in lost sales or delays in sales. Furthermore, new regulations or product standards, and changes to existing product standards could require IS&S to change its products and underlying technology. IS&S cannot ensure that it will receive regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all.\nIS&S relies on third-party suppliers for components of its products, including any necessary raw materials, and any interruption in the supply of these components could hinder its ability to deliver products on a timely basis.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing process consists primarily of assembling components purchased from its supply chain. The suppliers may not continue to be available to IS&S, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their businesses or financial conditions. If the Company is unable to maintain relationships with key third-party suppliers, the development and distribution of its products could be delayed until equivalent components can be obtained and integrated into the products. In addition, substitution of certain components from other manufacturers may require product redesign or FAA, EASA or other approvals, which could delay the Company\u2019s ability to ship products, and any increase in component costs, including the costs of any necessary raw materials, in the Company\u2019s supply chain could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nInasmuch as the Company\u2019s products utilize sophisticated technology and are deployed in complex aircraft cockpit environments, problems with these products may arise that could harm the Company\u2019s reputation for quality assurance and, consequently, its business prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s products use complex system designs and components that may contain errors, omissions, or defects, particularly when the Company incorporates new technologies into its products or when it releases new versions or enhancements of its existing products. Despite the Company\u2019s quality assurance process, errors, omissions or defects could occur in its current products, in new products, or in new versions or enhancements of existing products. IS&S may be required to redesign or recall those products or pay damages. Such an event could result in the following:\n\u00b7 delay or loss of revenues;\n\u00b7 cancellation of customer contracts;\n\u00b7 diversion of development resources;\n\u00b7 damage to the Company\u2019s reputation;\n\u00b7 increased service and warranty costs; or\n\u00b7 litigation costs.\nAlthough IS&S carries product liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses in the event of a large product liability claim. In addition, IS&S may not be able to maintain such insurance in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to protect its proprietary rights against potential risk of infringement. If IS&S is unable to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be unable to compete effectively.\nThe Company\u2019s success and ability to compete will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for its technology and products, both in the United States and internationally. In addition, IS&S must operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.\nAs of September 30, 2020, IS&S holds 47 U.S. patents and has 5 U.S. patent applications pending relating to its technology. In addition, the Company holds 102 international patents and has 12 international patent applications pending. IS&S cannot be certain that patents will be issued on any of its present or future applications. In addition, existing patents or future patents may not adequately protect the Company\u2019s technology if they are not broad enough or are successfully challenged, or if other entities are able to develop competing methods without violating its patents. If IS&S is not successful in protecting its intellectual property, competitors could begin to offer products that incorporate its technology. Patent protection involves complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, is highly uncertain. Litigation relating to intellectual property is often very time consuming and expensive. If a successful claim of patent infringement were made against IS&S, and if the Company were unable to develop non-infringing technology, or to license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, the Company might not be able to produce and sell some of its products. Further, IS&S has incurred, and may continue to incur, significant legal and other costs in defense of its intellectual property.\nIS&S depends on key personnel to manage its business effectively, and an inability to retain its key employees and plan for management succession could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to compete.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on the efforts, abilities, and expertise of its senior management and other key personnel. There can be no assurance IS&S will be able to retain such employees, and the loss of some could damage its ability to execute its business strategy. The Company intends to continue hiring key management, engineering, and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, and IS&S may not be able to attract or retain additional qualified personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s future success will depend in part on its ability to implement and improve its operational, administrative and financial systems and controls and to manage, train and expand its employee base. IS&S cannot provide assurance that current and planned personnel levels, systems, procedures, and controls will be adequate to support its current and future customer base. In such a circumstance, the Company may not be able to fully capitalize on existing and potential market opportunities. Any delays or difficulties encountered could impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract new customers or maintain its relationships with existing customers. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management and other key personnel could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may cause its stock price to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 demand for products and/or delivery schedule changes by its customers;\n\u00b7 capital expenditure budgets of aircraft owners and operators, and appropriation cycles of the U.S. government;\n\u00b7 changes in the use of the Company\u2019s products, including air data systems, flat panel displays, flight management systems and autothrottle technology;\n\u00b7 delays in introducing or obtaining government approval for new products;\n\u00b7 new product introductions by competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in IS&S pricing policies or pricing policies of competitors; and\n\u00b7 costs related to possible acquisition of technologies or businesses.\nA cyber security incident or other technology disruption could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe face certain security threats and technology disruptions, including threats to our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our or our customers\u2019 proprietary or classified information, threats of terrorism events, and failures of our technology tools and systems. Our IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. We are also involved with IT systems for certain customers and other third parties, for which we face similar security threats as for our own, in particular the DoD. In particular, cybersecurity threats-which include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, spyware and malware, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches-are persistent and evolve quickly. In general, such threats have increased in frequency, scope and potential impact in recent years. Further, a variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned IT and technological services provided by outside parties, support our critical functions. These technologies, as well as our products, are subject to failure and the user\u2019s inability to have such technologies properly supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies and, in certain cases, may contain open source and third-party software which may unbeknownst to us contain defects or viruses that pose unintended risks. These risks, if not effectively mitigated or controlled, could materially harm our business or reputation. While we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures and controls, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data.\nThe security measures we have implemented may become subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our IT systems. These security systems cannot provide absolute security. To the extent we were to experience a breach of our systems and were unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise impact the use of our IT systems. Moreover, if a security breach of our IT systems affects our computer systems or results in the release of personally identifiable or other sensitive information of customers, business partners, employees and other third parties, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability.\nSuch an event could require significant management attention and resources, negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions with customers, employees and others. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for breaches of contract or from product defects, and we are also subject to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management\u2019s attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome, or could harm the Company\u2019s reputation with customers, employees, investors and others.\nTax changes could affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and future profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s future results could be affected negatively by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in the overall profitability and changes to statutory tax rates in the United States and in other jurisdictions, changes in tax legislation, and the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns. In addition, adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations or future changes in tax law could lead to changes in the value of tax assets or liabilities that we currently or in the future may hold, which could materially affect our results of operations. Further, the nature and impact of any future changes to tax law, and the resulting impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, are uncertain.\nThe Company is subject to various laws and regulations. Changes to, or failure by the Company to comply with, these laws and regulations could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nThe Company is subject to, and must comply with, various laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the product-related and other regulations of the FAA and the EASA, U.S. government procurement regulations, the rules and regulations of the SEC, and local, state, federal, and international tax codes, import and export controls and customs laws, employment and employment-related laws, environmental laws, intellectual property laws, and consumer protection statutes. Failure to comply with all applicable laws could result in investigation and remediation costs to the Company and could adversely impact the operations and profits of the Company. In addition, the evolving and at times overlapping regulatory regimes to which the Company is subject may change at any time, including as a result of the upcoming change in the U.S. presidential administration. Any changes to existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could increase our compliance costs and operating costs. In addition, failure to timely comply with regulatory changes could cause payments to be withheld and/or an impact on future business.\nThe economic effects of \u201cBrexit\u201d may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d On January 31, 2020, the U.K. officially left the E.U. pursuant to Brexit, with a transitional period during which the U.K. remains bound to the E.U.\u2019s rules and regulations, which is set to expire on December 31, 2020. The ultimate impact on the Company\u2019s business as a result of Brexit will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations and on the ultimate manner and timing of the U.K.\u2019s final withdrawal from the E.U. following the transitional period.\nAs a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the British pound as compared to the U.S. dollar. A potential devaluation of the local currencies of our international customers relative to the U.S. dollar may impair the purchasing power of our international customers and could cause international customers to decrease their volume of orders or cancel orders completely.\nBrexit may also lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate, and those laws and regulations may be cumbersome, difficult or costly in terms of compliance. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nVolatility and weakness in capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs, which could adversely affect IS&S.\nBank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. During these periods of volatility and disruption, risks to IS&S include:\n\u00b7 declines in revenues and profitability from reduced orders, payment delays or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers;\n\u00b7 reprioritization of government spending away from defense programs in which IS&S participates;\n\u00b7 reduced access to credit sources; and\n\u00b7 disruptions in supplies associated with any financial constraints faced by vendors.\nIf the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to accurately report its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the Company and, as a result, the value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires, among other things, that the Company maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company is required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by management in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company\u2019s compliance with Section 404 requires that it compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform an appropriate evaluation. During the evaluation and testing process, if the Company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, it will be unable to assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective. The Company cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit the Company\u2019s ability to accurately report its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If the Company is unable to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if its independent registered public accounting firm determines the Company has a material weakness or significant deficiency in its internal control over financial reporting once that firm begin its reviews, the Company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, the market price of its common stock could decline, and it could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict the Company\u2019s future access to the capital markets.", "PERMNO": 88534, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "ISSC"}
