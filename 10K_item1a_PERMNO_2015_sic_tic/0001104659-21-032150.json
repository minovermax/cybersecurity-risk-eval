{"cik": "894158", "company": "Synthetic Biologics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the risks related to our business set forth in this Annual Report and the other information included in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the risks described below before purchasing our securities. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe will need to raise additional capital to operate our business and our failure to obtain funding when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our development programs or commercialization efforts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our operating activities used net cash of approximately $12.2 million and as of December 31, 2020 our cash and cash equivalents were $6.2 million. With the exception of the three months ended December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2010, we have experienced significant losses since inception and have a significant accumulated deficit. As of December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit totaled approximately $248.1 million on a consolidated basis. We expect to incur additional operating losses in the future and therefore expect our cumulative losses to increase. With the exception of the quarter ended June 30, 2010, and limited laboratory revenues from Adeona Clinical Laboratory, which we sold in March 2012, we have generated very minimal revenues. We do not expect to derive revenue from any source in the near future until we or our potential partners successfully commercialize our products. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our anticipated activities, particularly as we continue research and development, initiate and conduct clinical trials, and seek marketing approval for our product candidates. Until such time as we receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we will not be permitted to sell our products and therefore will not have product revenues from the sale of products. For the foreseeable future we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from equity and debt offerings, cash on hand, licensing and collaboration fees and grants, if any.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and meet our current timelines and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. Based on our current plans, our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to complete our planned Phase 1a/2a clinical trial of SYN-004, our planned Phase 1 single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose clinical trials of SYN-020, and a potential Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-020 but, may not be sufficient for post-Phase 2a future clinical programs for SYN-020 or additional trials of SYN-004, which are expected to require significant cash expenditures. In addition, based on the significant anticipated cost of a Phase 3 clinical program in a broad indication for SYN-004, we expect it will not be feasible for us to initiate and complete this trial at this time without a partner given the capital constraints tied to our current market cap and share price. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our ability to conduct our business and also have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. A failure otherwise to secure additional funds when needed in the future whether through an equity or debt financing or a sufficient amount of capital without a strategic partnership could result in us being unable to complete planned preclinical and clinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be forced to delay, discontinue or curtail product development, forego sales and marketing efforts, and forego licensing in attractive business opportunities. We also may be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available.\nThe COVID-19 global health crisis has impacted our planned operations, including our clinical studies\nIn January 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic for the novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19. Since then, the COVID-19 coronavirus has spread to multiple countries, including throughout the United States. We have experienced disruptions that have impacted our business and clinical trials and expect to experience additional disruptions as the pandemic continues, including:\n\u2022 unwillingness of potential study participants to enroll in new clinical trials and/or visit healthcare facilities;\n\u2022 postponement of enrollment in our SYN-004 Phase 1b/2a clinical study;\n\u2022 postponement of the initiation of our SYN-020 single ascending and multiple ascending dose studies;\n\u2022 diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical site visits by study participants and clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others;\n\u2022 limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u2022 delays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n\u2022 delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022 interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials, such as investigational drug product used in our clinical trials;\n\u2022 changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\u2022 delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; and\n\u2022 delay in the timing of interactions with the FDA due to absenteeism by federal employees or by the diversion of their efforts and attention to approval of other therapeutics or other activities related to COVID-19.\nOur business and the business of the suppliers of our clinical product candidates has been and is expected to continue to be materially and adversely affected by the pandemic. Such events could result in the continued delay or complete or partial closure of clinical trial sites or one or more manufacturing facilities which could impact our supply of our clinical product candidates. In addition, it could impact economies and financial markets, resulting in an economic downturn that could impact our ability to raise capital or slow down potential partnering relationships.\nIn response to the spread of COVID-19 as well as public health directives and orders, we have implemented a number of measures designed to ensure employee safety and business continuity. We have limited access to our offices and are allowing our administrative employees to continue their work outside of our offices in order to support the community efforts to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and protect employees, complying with guidance from federal, state and local government and health authorities. The effects of the governmental orders and our work-from-home policies may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course.\nIn addition. the COVID-19 outbreak could disrupt our operations due to absenteeism by infected or ill members of management or other employees, or absenteeism by members of management and other employees who elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office, or due to quarantines. The COVID-19 illness could also impact members of our Board of Directors resulting in absenteeism from meetings of the directors or committees of directors, and making it more difficult to convene the quorums of the full Board of Directors or its committees needed to conduct meetings for the management of our affairs.\nThe global outbreak of the virus continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the virus may continue to impact our business and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, operations, or the global economy as a whole. While the spread of COVID-19 may eventually be contained or mitigated, there is no guarantee that a future outbreak of this or any other widespread epidemics will not occur, or that the global economy will recover, either of which could seriously harm our business.\nWe recently have experienced delays in clinical testing of our product candidates due to COVID-19 and may in the future experience other delays. These delays may result in the need for trials to be redesigned and will impact whether they will be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic, delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial, in securing clinical trial agreements with prospective sites with acceptable terms, in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site, in recruiting patients to participate in a clinical trial or in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials. Manufacturing considerations for clinical development candidates may include an expected several month lead time following a decision to commence any clinical trial(s) and capacity considerations of our third-party contract manufacturers to provide clinical supply of our product candidates could cause delays in clinical trials. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many manufacturers have been prioritizing the manufacture of COVD-19 related products, increasing the manufacturing lead times for non-COVID-19 related products. Many factors affect patient enrollment, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and new drugs approved for the conditions we are investigating. Clinical investigators will need to decide whether to offer their patients enrollment in clinical trials of our product candidates versus treating these patients with commercially available drugs that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and timeliness and approval process and delay our ability to generate revenue.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures.\nOther than with respect to the three months ended December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2010, we have a history of losses and we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial losses and negative operating cash flow. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we may still incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may not sustain profitability. We expect that later stage clinical trials, including a Phase 3 clinical program of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) for the prevention of CDI will enroll a greater number of patients than our prior clinical trials and will be more costly than our prior clinical trials. In addition, we anticipate a need for additional employees as we undertake later stage clinical trials. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will substantially increase in the foreseeable future as we do the following:\n\u2022 continue to undertake preclinical development and mid and late-stage clinical trials for our product candidates, including SYN-004 (ribaxamase), and SYN-020;\n\u2022 seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u2022 develop our product candidates for commercialization;\n\u2022 implement additional internal systems and infrastructure;\n\u2022 license or acquire additional technologies;\n\u2022 lease additional or alternative office facilities;\n\u2022 manufacture product for clinical trials; and\n\u2022 hire additional personnel, including members of our management team.\nWe may experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our development and clinical programs with capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to raise additional capital or generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability, which we do not anticipate will occur in the near future, could negatively impact the value of our common stock and underlying securities.\nThe actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many risk factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022 the progress of our research activities;\n\u2022 the number and scope of our research programs;\n\u2022 the progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities;\n\u2022 the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into research and development agreements and amount of funding received from partners and collaborators;\n\u2022 our ability to maintain current research and development licensing arrangements and to establish new research and development and licensing arrangements;\n\u2022 our ability to achieve our milestones under licensing arrangements;\n\u2022 the costs associated with manufacturing-related services to produce materials for use in our clinical trials;\n\u2022 the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 the costs incurred to screen and enroll patients; and\n\u2022 The costs and timing of regulatory approvals.\nWe have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of our shares or debt and other sources. Additionally, we may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements. We do not have any committed sources of financing at this time, and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe currently have no products approved for commercial sale, have no significant source of revenue and may never generate significant revenue.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends heavily on:\n\u2022 our ability to raise additional capital on a timely basis to continue to fund our clinical trials;\n\u2022 demonstration in current and future clinical trials that our lead product candidates, SYN-004 (ribaxamase) for the prevention C. difficile infection and aGVHD and SYN-020, are safe and effective;\n\u2022 our ability to seek and obtain regulatory approvals, including with respect to the indications we are seeking;\n\u2022 successful manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates; and\n\u2022 market acceptance of our products.\nAll of our existing product candidates are in various stages of development and will require extensive additional clinical evaluation, regulatory review and approval, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they could provide us with any revenue. As a result, even if we successfully develop, achieve regulatory approval and commercialize our products, we may be unable to generate revenue for many years, if at all. We do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from product sales for at least several years, if at all. If we are unable to generate revenue from product sales, we will not become profitable, and we may be unable to continue our operations.\nOur research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may limit our ability to achieve profitability. We are largely dependent on the success of our lead product candidates, SYN-004 and SYN-020, which require significant additional clinical testing before we can seek regulatory approval and we cannot be certain that these product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nWe must continue to explore opportunities that may lead to new products and technologies. To accomplish this, we must commit substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Any such expenditures that we make will be made without any assurance that our efforts will be successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.\nThe success of our business currently depends on our development, approval and commercialization of our lead product candidates, SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and SYN-020. Our planned Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 for the prevention of aGVHD in allogeneic HCT recipients and planned Phase 1 single ascending and multiple ascending dose studies of SYN-020 are not designed as registrational clinical trials and we currently do not have the necessary funding to complete any registrational clinical trials. There are many uncertainties known and unknown that may affect the outcome of future clinical trials. All of our product candidates, including SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and SYN-020, will require additional clinical and non-clinical development, regulatory review and approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenue from product sales. Regardless of whether our clinical trials are deemed to be successful, promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or satisfy regulatory criteria, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) or SYN-020 in a timely manner would have a material adverse impact on our business. Even if we successfully develop SYN-004 (ribaxamase) or SYN-020 or other new products or enhancements, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors\u2019 innovations. Innovations may not be quickly accepted in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our products under development will be launched, whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire drug candidates or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause our products to become obsolete, which may limit our ability to achieve profitability.\nWe are actively seeking and may form or seek strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements.\nWe are actively seeking and may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If we license products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to retain rights licensed to us by others to commercialize key products and may not be able to establish or maintain the relationships we need to develop, manufacture, and market our products.\nIn addition to our own patent applications, we also currently rely on licensing agreements with third party patent holders/licensors for our products. We entered into an option agreement with MGH to enter into an exclusive license to intellectual property and technology related to the use of IAP to maintain GI and microbiome health, diminish systemic inflammation, and treat age-related diseases. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reach agreement on license terms or that the terms will be favorable to us. This license agreement is expected to require us to meet certain diligence requirements and timelines in order to keep the license agreement in effect. In addition, certain license agreements, including the one that may potentially be entered into with MGH, typically contain provisions requiring royalty free non-exclusive licenses to the U.S government if any federal funding was used to invent any of the patents being licensed. In the event we or our sublicensee are not able to meet our diligence requirements contained in the license agreement with MGH or any other license agreement, we may not be able to retain the rights granted under our agreement or renegotiate with our arrangement institution on reasonable terms, or at all. If any license were to terminate and we were to lose the right to commercialize our products, our business opportunity would be adversely affected. Furthermore, we currently have very limited product development capabilities, and limited marketing or sales capabilities. For us to research, develop, and test our product candidates, we would need to contract with outside researchers, in most cases those parties that did the original research and from whom we have licensed the technologies. Our ECC agreement with Intrexon provides that Intrexon may terminate an agreement if we do not perform certain specified requirements, including developing therapies considered superior. Our agreement with UT Austin allows UT Austin to terminate its agreement if we fail to comply with the terms of the agreement.\nWe can give no assurances that any of our issued patents licensed to us or any of our other patent applications will provide us with significant proprietary protection or be of commercial benefit to us. Furthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability, nor does the issuance of a patent provide the patent holder with freedom to operate without infringing the patent rights of others.\nWe may incur additional expenses in connection with our licenses and collaboration arrangements and our development of our product candidates.\nOur agreements with Washington University and MGH may require that we initiate certain studies and file or have accepted an NDA within a certain amount of time, each of which are costly and will require additional expenditures. Although all manufacturing, preclinical studies and human clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, costs associated with the manufacturing, research and development of biologic product candidates are generally greater in comparison to small molecule product candidates. Due to our corporate restructuring plan to reduce cost that was implemented in 2018, we have a reduced work force and expect in future years to require additional personnel to support our later stage research and development efforts. In addition, we intend to commence manufacturing of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and SYN-020 materials to support potential future clinical studies which will require us to incur additional expenses.\nBecause development activities in our collaborations are sometimes determined pursuant to joint steering committees, future development costs associated with these programs may be difficult to anticipate and may exceed our expectations. Our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include, but are not limited to, unanticipated technical challenges, enrollment challenges, changes in the focus and direction of our development activities or adjustments necessitated by changes in the competitive landscape in which we operate. If we are unable to continue to financially support such collaborations due to our own working capital constraints, we may be forced to delay our activities. If we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may be forced to seek licensing partners or discontinue development.\nDevelopments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including the monoclonal antibody industry, are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multi-national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies developing both generic and proprietary therapies to treat serious diseases. Many of our competitors have drugs that have already been commercialized and therefore benefit from being first to market their products. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, human, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of our potential competitors have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages in the therapeutic areas we are currently pursuing. Academic research centers, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those being developed by us. In addition, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent protection, obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us, including for different indications of the same active ingredients that comprise our pipeline products. These competitors will compete with us in product sales as well as recruitment and retention of qualified scientific and management personnel, establishment of clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in the acquisition of technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for the prevention and treatment of C. difficile infection include: Actelion Pharmaceutical Ltd., Artugen Therapeutics, Inc., AzurRx, Inc., Da Volterra, Deinove, Merck & Co. Inc., Merus B.V., Pfizer Inc., Rebiotix, Inc., Seres Therapeutics, Inc., Summit Therapeutics plc., and Vedanta Biosciences, Inc. Companies that sell or are developing products for the treatment or prevention of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) include: Amgen, Inc., Astellas Pharma, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Mallinckrodt plc, Novartis International AG, Pfizer, Inc., Roche AG and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for pertussis include: GlaxoSmithKline plc, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation and Sanofi S.A. AG. The infectious disease market is highly competitive with many generic and proprietary intravenous and oral formulations available to physicians and their patients. For our monoclonal antibodies, we currently do not expect to be able to deliver our infectious disease candidates via the oral route and may thus be limited to the in-patient and/or acute treatment setting. In addition, academic research centers may develop technologies that compete with our SYN-004, SYN-020, and SYN-005 products and our other technologies. Should clinicians or regulatory authorities view alternative therapeutic regiments as more effective than our products, this might delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for our products, or it might prevent us from obtaining favorable reimbursement rates from payers, such as Medicare, Medicaid, hospitals and private insurers.\nWe may seek to selectively establish collaborations, and, if we are unable to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur product development programs and the potential commercialization of our clinical product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates (such as our planned phase 3 clinical trial of SYN-004) we may decide to collaborate with governmental entities or additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with our product candidate.\nIf the parties we depend on for supplying substance raw materials for our product candidates and certain manufacturing-related services do not timely supply these products and services in sufficient quality or quantity, it may delay or impair our ability to develop, manufacture and market our product candidates.\nWe rely on suppliers for the substance raw materials of our product candidates and third parties for manufacturing-related services to produce material that meets appropriate content, quality and stability standards and use in clinical trials of our products and, after approval, for commercial distribution. To succeed, clinical trials require adequate supplies of study material, which may be difficult or uneconomical to procure or manufacture and there can be no assurance that we will successfully procure such study material or even if procured, that we can do so in quantities and in a timely manner to allow our clinical trials to proceed as planned. We and our suppliers and vendors may not be able to (i) produce our study material to appropriate standards for use in clinical studies, (ii) perform under any definitive manufacturing, supply or service agreements with us, or (iii) remain in business for a sufficient time to successfully produce and market our product candidates. If we do not maintain important manufacturing and service relationships, we may fail to find a replacement supplier or required vendor or manufacturer which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any. If we do find replacement manufacturers and vendors, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us and there could be a substantial delay before a new facility could be qualified and registered with the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities.\nThe third-party manufacturers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and drug product for our lead product candidates, SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and SYN-020, are established cGMP manufacturers. For all other therapeutic areas, we have not yet established cGMP manufacturers for our biologic and drug candidates. We do not currently have a definitive agreement with any third-party vendors for the manufacture of additional quantities of SYN-004 or SYN-020 and we currently have only one manufacturer for each of our lead product candidates. Although we believe additional manufacturers are available, if either of our manufacturers were to limit or terminate production or otherwise fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy the supply commitments, the process of locating and qualifying alternate sources could require up to several months, during which time our production could be delayed. Any curtailment in the availability of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) or SYN-020 could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, because regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for pharmaceutical products, changes in raw material suppliers may result in production delays or higher raw material costs.\nThe manufacture of our product candidates requires significant expertise and manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations. We may experience longer than expected lead times with respect to the manufacture of clinical drug supply, which may result from the increase in manufacturing scale necessary to conduct our anticipated late stage clinical trials and result in trial delays. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many manufacturers have been prioritizing the manufacture of COVID-19 related products, increasing the manufacturing lead times for non-COVID-19 related products. In addition, any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with conducting our clinical trials and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at significant additional expense or to terminate a clinical trial.\nWe are responsible for ensuring that each of our contract manufacturers comply with the cGMP requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities from which we seek to obtain product approval. While we oversee compliance, we do not have control over our manufacturers and their compliance with regulatory requirements. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. The approval process for NDAs includes a review of the manufacturer\u2019s compliance with cGMP requirements. We are responsible for regularly assessing a contract manufacturer\u2019s compliance with cGMP requirements through record reviews and periodic audits and for ensuring that the contract manufacturer takes responsibility and corrective action for any identified deviations.\nA failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. Furthermore, if our manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be unable to meet demand for any approved products and would lose potential revenues.\nWe may fail to retain or recruit necessary personnel, and we may be unable to secure the services of consultants.\nAs of March 3, 2021, we employed 10 full-time employees. We have also engaged clinical consultants to advise us on our clinical programs and regulatory consultants to advise us on our dealings with the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities. Due to our corporate restructuring plan to reduce cost that was implemented in 2018, we have reduced our work force and expect in future years to require additional personnel to support our later stage research and development efforts. We have been and may be required to retain additional consultants and employees in order to fulfill our obligations under our licenses and collaborations for our development of SYN-004, SYN-020 and our agreements with Washington University and other collaborators. Our future performance will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate newly hired officers into our management team and our ability to develop an effective working relationship among senior management.\nCertain of our directors, scientific advisors, and consultants serve as officers, directors, scientific advisors, or consultants of other biopharmaceutical or biotechnology companies that might be developing competitive products to ours. Other than corporate opportunities, none of our directors are obligated under any agreement or understanding with us to make any additional products or technologies available to us. Similarly, we can give no assurances, and we do not expect and stockholders should not expect, that any biomedical or pharmaceutical product or technology identified by any of our directors or affiliates in the future would be made available to us other than corporate opportunities. We can give no assurances that any such other companies will not have interests that are in conflict with our interests.\nLosing key personnel or failing to recruit necessary additional personnel would impede our ability to attain our development objectives. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the drug and biologic development areas, and we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel we would need to develop our business.\nWe rely on independent organizations, advisors, and consultants to perform certain services for us, including handling substantially all aspects of regulatory approval, clinical management, manufacturing, marketing, and sales. We expect that this will continue to be the case. Such services may not always be available to us on a timely basis when we need them.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems and are vulnerable to damage and interruption.\nWe rely on our information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client and supplier information. Additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer and process data. Our information technology systems, as well as the systems of our suppliers and other partners, whose systems we do not control, are vulnerable to outages and an increasing risk of continually evolving deliberate intrusions to gain access to company sensitive information. Likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. A cyber-attack or other significant disruption involving our information technology systems, or those of our vendors, suppliers and other partners, could also result in disruptions in critical systems, corruption or loss of data and theft of data, funds or intellectual property. We may be unable to prevent outages or security breaches in our systems. We remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or yet unknown threats as, in some instances, we, our suppliers and our other partners may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We also face the risk that we expose our vendors or partners to cybersecurity attacks. Any or all of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and our business reputation.\nAny failure to maintain the security of information relating to our customers, employees and suppliers, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures, and could disrupt our operations and harm our reputation.\nIn connection with the pre-clinical and clinical development, sales and marketing of our products and services, we may from time to time transmit confidential information. We also have access to, collect or maintain private or confidential information regarding our clinical trials and the patients enrolled therein, employees, and suppliers, as well as our business. Cyberattacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is possible that computer hackers and others might compromise our security measures, or security measures of those parties that we do business with now or in the future, and obtain the personal information of patients in our clinical trials, vendors, employees and suppliers or our business information. A security breach of any kind, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and attacks by hackers, employees or others, could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, government enforcement actions, regulatory penalties and costly response measures, and could seriously disrupt our operations. Any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation, which could cause us to lose market share and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nREGULATORY RISKS\nIf we do not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in the U.S. and/or other countries we will not be able to sell our product candidates.\nWe cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates or any product candidates we acquire or develop in the future. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the U.S. and approvals from the FDA-equivalent regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions. We will be required to conduct clinical trials that will be costly and we currently do not have the funding to complete any registrational clinical trials. We cannot predict whether our clinical trials will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates or if the results of any clinical trials will be sufficient to advance to the next phase of development or for approval from the FDA. We also cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs or therapeutics that the FDA considers safe and effective for the proposed indications. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process. The approval process may be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may prevent or delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from our product candidates; and diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise believe that we hold.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs or BLAs. We may never obtain regulatory clearance for any of our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us without a saleable product, and therefore without any source of revenues, until another product candidate can be developed. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire another product candidate.\nIn addition, the FDA may require us to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies, as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product. The results generated after approval could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product. The FDA has significant post-market authority, including the explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The FDA\u2019s exercise of its authority has in some cases resulted, and in the future could result, in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products.\nIn foreign jurisdictions, we must also receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize any products, which can be time consuming and costly. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above. There can be no assurance that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidate for sale outside the United States.\nIf the FDA approves any of our product candidates, the labeling, manufacturing, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping for our products will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements and continued regulatory oversight and review. Our drug manufacturers and subcontractors that we retain will be required to comply with FDA and other regulations. We may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and/or may be subject to product recalls, seizures, suspension of regulatory approval, suspension of production, injunctions or civil or criminal sanctions. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product, and could include withdrawal of the product from the market.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to design and implement.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming. We estimate that clinical trials for our product candidates would take at least several years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. Commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:\n\u2022 obtaining an IND application with the FDA to commence clinical trials;\n\u2022 identification of, and acceptable arrangements with, one or more clinical sites;\n\u2022 obtaining IRB approval to commence clinical trials;\n\u2022 unforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022 determination of dosing;\n\u2022 lack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u2022 slower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u2022 inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u2022 inability to obtain supply of our drug candidate in a timely manner;\n\u2022 inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u2022 unwillingness of the FDA or IRBs to permit the clinical trials to be initiated.\nIn addition, we, IRBs or the FDA may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if IRBs or the FDA finds deficiencies in our submissions or conduct of our trials.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims and the results of preclinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results.\nTo date, long-term safety and efficacy have not yet been demonstrated in clinical trials for any of our product candidates. Favorable results in our early studies or trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials as was the case with SYN-010. Even if our clinical trials are initiated and completed as planned, we cannot be certain that the results will support our product candidate claims. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. Success of our predecessor P1A clinical product or positive topline data from our previous SYN-004 (ribaxamase) Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, does not ensure success of SYN-004 (ribaxamase),. Furthermore, the FDA could determine that SYN-004 (ribaxamase) has not demonstrated safety and require additional clinical trials and safety data, despite positive results from our SYN-004 (ribaxamase) Phase 2b clinical trial and the determination by clinical sites investigators and an independent third party that the serious adverse events that occurred in the group that received SYN-004 in our Phase 2b clinical trial were not drug related. We cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials would replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing nor that they would satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety issues, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved as products. Any such failure could cause us or our sublicensee to abandon a product candidate and might delay development of other product candidates. Preclinical and clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals or commercialization. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay our obtaining FDA approval for the affected product candidate and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize that product candidate.\nDifficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials or delays in enrollment are expected to result in our clinical development activities being delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased cost or may adversely affect timing or outcome of planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates. This can lead to delays in completion of clinical trials as well as additional expense for recruitment of patients. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may result in fewer technicians being available to conduct clinical testing for patients currently enrolled in our clinical trial.\nPatients who are administered our product candidates may experience unexpected side effects or other safety risks that could cause a halt in their clinical development, preclude approval of our product candidates or limit their commercial potential.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended at any time for a number of reasons. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to the clinical trial patients. For example, the FDA could determine that SYN-004 has not demonstrated safety, that adverse events are drug related and require additional clinical trials and safety data, despite positive results from our SYN-004 Phase 2b clinical trial and the determination by clinical sites investigators and an independent third party that the adverse events that occurred in the group that received SYN-004 in our Phase 2b clinical trial were not drug related.\nAdministering any product candidate to humans may produce undesirable side effects. These side effects could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of our product candidates and could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying further development or approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Ultimately, some or all of our product candidates may prove to be unsafe for human use. Moreover, we could be subject to significant liability if any volunteer or patient suffers, or appears to suffer, adverse health effects as a result of participating in our clinical trials. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates and could substantially increase commercialization costs.\nOur product candidates, if approved for sale, may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenues.\nIf one of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any approved product by physicians, healthcare professionals and third-party payors and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 demonstration of safety and efficacy;\n\u2022 changes in the practice guidelines and the standard of care for the targeted indication;\n\u2022 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u2022 budget impact of adoption of our product on relevant drug formularies;\n\u2022 the availability, cost and potential advantages of alternative treatments, including less expensive generic drugs;\n\u2022 pricing, reimbursement and cost effectiveness, which may be subject to regulatory control;\n\u2022 effectiveness of our or any of our partners\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022 the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries; and\n\u2022 the availability of adequate third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement.\nIf any product candidate that we develop does not provide a treatment regimen that is as beneficial as, or is perceived as being as beneficial as, the current standard of care or otherwise does not provide patient benefit, that product candidate, if approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, likely will not achieve market acceptance. Our ability to effectively promote and sell any approved products will also depend on pricing and cost-effectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive price and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. If any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and third-party payors, our ability to generate revenues from that product would be substantially reduced. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources, may be constrained by FDA rules and policies on product promotion, and may never be successful.\nWe depend on third parties, including researchers and sublicensees, who are not under our control. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to seek or obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have in-licensed some of our product candidates, have sublicensed a product candidate, and have collaboration agreements for the development of other product candidates. As a result, we depend upon our sublicensee and independent investigators and scientific collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions or private physician scientists, to advise us and to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. These collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs or the timing of their procurement of clinical-trial data or their compliance with applicable regulatory guidelines. Should any of these scientific inventors/advisors or those of our sublicensee become disabled or die unexpectedly, or should they fail to comply with applicable regulatory guidelines, we or our sublicensee may be forced to scale back or terminate development of that program. They may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking those programs ourselves. Failing to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug-development programs, or substandard performance and failure to comply with regulatory guidelines, could result in delay of any FDA applications and our commercialization of the drug candidate involved.\nThese collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. Our collaborators assisting our competitors could harm our competitive position.\nWith respect to our product candidate for pertussis in collaboration with UT Austin, we are dependent on its research laboratories as we have no such facilities or capabilities of our own. If any of the foregoing were to become inaccessible or terminated, it would be difficult for us to develop and commercialize our synthetic biologic product candidates.\nWe have in the past and expect to have in the future agreements with third-party contract research organizations (CROs) under which we have delegated to the CROs the responsibility to coordinate and monitor the conduct of our SYN-004 and SYN-020 clinical trials and to manage data for our clinical programs. Our planned Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 and planned Phase 1 clinical trials of SYN-020 will be conducted by clinical sites over which we have little direct control. We, our CROs and our clinical sites are required to comply with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, regulations and guidelines issued by the FDA and by similar governmental authorities in other countries where we are conducting clinical trials. We have an ongoing obligation to monitor the activities conducted by our CROs and at our clinical sites to confirm compliance with these requirements. In the future, if we, our CROs or our clinical sites fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations and will require a large number of test subjects. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. If our CROs or investigator-sponsored clinical sites do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nWe currently have no marketing, sales or distribution organization and have no experience in marketing products as a company. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe currently have no marketing, sales or distribution capabilities and have no experience in marketing products. We may develop an in-house marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. We will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel.\nIf we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to commercialize any product in the United States or overseas.\nReimbursement may not be available for our product candidates, which would impede sales.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidates may depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and health care reform measures. Decisions about formulary coverage as well as levels at which government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, reimburse patients for the price they pay for our products as well as levels at which these payors pay directly for our products, where applicable, could affect whether we are able to commercialize these products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any of our products. Also, we cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize our products.\nIn recent years, officials have made numerous proposals to change the health care system in the United States. These proposals include measures that would limit or prohibit payments for certain medical treatments or subject the pricing of drugs to government control. In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. If our products are or become subject to government regulation that limits or prohibits payment for our products, or that subjects the price of our products to governmental control, we may not be able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nAs a result of legislative proposals and the trend towards managed health care in the United States, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may also impose strict prior authorization requirements and/or refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly-approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates\u2019 commercial success.\nThe U.S. government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing continued healthcare reform. Any government-adopted reform measures could adversely impact the pricing of healthcare products and services in the United States or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third party payors. The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.\nNew laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, that relate to healthcare availability, methods of delivery or payment for products and services, or sales, marketing or pricing, may limit our potential revenue, and we may need to revise our research and development programs. The pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging due to several reasons, including policies advanced by the current executive administration in the United States, new healthcare legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits related to the testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we sell our product candidates commercially. Currently, we are not aware of any anticipated product liability claims with respect to our product candidates. In the future, an individual may bring a liability claim against us if one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against the product liability claim, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 decreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 injury to our reputation;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 costs of related litigation;\n\u00b7 initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u00b7 distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u00b7 product recalls;\n\u00b7 loss of revenue; and\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have clinical trial liability insurance. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for our product candidates. Our current insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us. In addition, because of the increasing costs of insurance coverage, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy liabilities that may arise.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nWe rely on patent applications and various regulatory exclusivities to protect some of our product candidates and our ability to compete may be limited or eliminated if we are not able to protect our products.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual questions. We may incur significant expenses in protecting our intellectual property and defending or assessing claims with respect to intellectual property owned by others. Any patent or other infringement litigation by or against us could cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management. Even for our issued patents, we do not have a guarantee of patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity of the ingredients for our drugs under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, even if we are granted FDA approval of our products.\nOthers may file patent applications or obtain patents on similar technologies or compounds that compete with our products. We cannot predict how broad the claims in any such patents or applications will be, and whether they will be allowed. Once claims have been issued, we cannot predict how they will be construed or enforced. We may infringe intellectual property rights of others without being aware of it. If another party claims we are infringing their technology, we could have to defend an expensive and time consuming lawsuit, pay a large sum if we are found to be infringing, or be prohibited from selling or licensing our products unless we obtain a license or redesign our product, which may not be possible.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Some of our current or former employees, consultants, scientific advisors, current or prospective corporate collaborators, may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors or use our proprietary technology for their own benefit. Furthermore, enforcing a claim alleging the infringement of our trade secrets would be expensive and difficult to prove, making the outcome uncertain. Our competitors may also independently develop similar knowledge, methods, and know-how or gain access to our proprietary information through some other means.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights, as well as costs associated with lawsuits.\nIf any other person files patent applications, or is issued patents, claiming technology also claimed by us in pending applications, we may be required to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention. We, or our licensors, may also need to participate in interference proceedings involving our issued patents and pending applications of another entity.\nThe intellectual property environment in the monoclonal antibody field is particularly complex, constantly evolving and highly fragmented. We have not conducted freedom-to-use patent searches on all aspects of our product candidates or potential product candidates, and we may be unaware of relevant patents and patent applications of third parties. In addition, the freedom-to-use patent searches that have been conducted may not have identified all relevant issued patents or pending patents. We cannot provide assurance that our proposed products in this area will not ultimately be held to infringe one or more valid claims owned by third parties which may exist or come to exist in the future or that in such case we will be able to obtain a license from such parties on acceptable terms.\nWe cannot guarantee that the practice of our technologies will not conflict with the rights of others. In some foreign jurisdictions, we could become involved in opposition proceedings, either by opposing the validity of another\u2019s foreign patent or by persons opposing the validity of our foreign patents.\nWe may also face frivolous litigation or lawsuits from various competitors or from litigious securities attorneys. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to these areas, even if deemed frivolous or resolved in our favor, could be substantial and could distract management from our business. Uncertainties resulting from initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our operations.\nIf we infringe the rights of others, we could be prevented from selling products or forced to pay damages.\nIf our products, methods, processes, and other technologies are found to infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could be required to pay damages, or we may be required to cease using the technology or to license rights from the prevailing party. Any prevailing party may be unwilling to offer us a license on commercially acceptable terms.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR SECURITIES\nWe cannot assure you that our common stock will be liquid or that it will remain listed on the NYSE American. A failure to regain compliance with the NYSE American stockholders\u2019 equity listing requirements or failure to continue to meet the other listing requirements could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE American. The NYSE American\u2019s listing standards generally mandate that we meet certain requirements relating to stockholders\u2019 equity, stock price, market capitalization, aggregate market value of publicly held shares and distribution requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the continued listing standards of the NYSE American. The NYSE American requires companies to meet certain continued listing criteria including a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $6.0 million if an issuer has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent years, as outlined in the NYSE American Company Guide. At December 31, 2020, we had a stockholders\u2019 deficit of $7.5 million. The NYSE American Company Guide also states that the NYSE normally will not consider removing from listing securities of an issuer if it is in compliance with all of the following:a total value of market capitalization of at least $50.0 million; 1,100,000 publicly-held shares; a market value of publicly held shares of at least $15.0 million; and 400 round lot shareholders. Although we have more than 1,100,000 shares publicly held and 400 round lot shareholders, our stock price is volatile and, during 2019 and 2020, the price of our common stock experienced a sustained decrease resulting in a period where our market capitalization fell below $50.0 million. Our market capitalization is currently above $50.0 million.\nIf our common stock falls below $0.20 per share on a 30-trading-day average it will become subject to the continued listing evaluation and follow-up procedures set forth in Section 1009 of the NYSE American Company Guide which could, among other things, result in initiation of immediate delisting procedures. In the event that we were to fail to meet the requirements of NYSE American per share price requirement or stockholders\u2019 equity requirement and we could not timely cure such deficiency, our listing could become subject to NYSE American continued listing evaluation and follow-up procedures, which could result in delisting procedures.\nOn November 25, 2019, we announced that we received written communication from the NYSE American stating we were no longer in compliance with certain continued listing standards as set forth in the NYSE American Company Guide relating to stockholders\u2019 equity as of September 30, 2019. Specifically, the Deficiency Letter stated that we were not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) (requiring stockholders\u2019 equity of $6.0 million or more if it has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years). The Deficiency Letter noted that the Company had a stockholders\u2019 equity of $4.9 million as of September 30, 2019, and had reported net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. On December 20, 2019, we submitted a plan of compliance to the NYSE American outlining our plan to regain compliance with certain continued listing standards as set forth in Part 10, Section 1003(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide by November 25, 2020, the conclusion of the compliance plan period. On February 7, 2020, we received notice from the NYSE American that it had accepted our plan and granted a plan period through November 25, 2020 to regain compliance. On July 30, 2020 we received written communication from NYSE American stating that in addition to Section 1003(iii), we were also not in compliance with Section 1003(i) and Section 1003(ii) of the NYSE American Company Guide since we reported a stockholders\u2019 deficit of ($4.0) million as of March 31, 2020 and losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2019. As a result, the Company is now subject to the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 1009 of the Company Guide. We remain subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange\u2019s letter dated November 25, 2019 for the initial equity noncompliance. The NYSE Regulation staff will review our company periodically for compliance with the initiatives outlined in the plan. If we are not in compliance with the continued listing standards by November 25, 2020 or if we do not make progress consistent with the plan during the plan period, NYSE Regulation staff may initiate delisting proceeding as appropriate. On November 23, 2020 we received written communication from NYSE American notifying us that we have had been granted an extension until May 25, 2021 to regain compliance with certain continued listing standards as set forth in Sections 1003(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide. We will remain subject to periodic review by NYSE American staff during the extension period. Failure to make progress consistent with the plan or regain compliance with the continued listing standards by the end of the extension period could result in the Company being delisted from the NYSE American.\nThere can be no assurance that we can regain compliance with the listing standards of the NYSE American, or that the NYSE American will continue to list our common stock if we regain compliance, or if we continue to fail to maintain the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity. In addition, in the future we may not be able to maintain such minimum stockholders\u2019 equity and/or issue additional equity securities in exchange for cash or other assets, if available, to maintain certain minimum stockholders\u2019 equity required by the NYSE American. If we are delisted from the NYSE American then our common stock will trade, if at all, only on the over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board securities market, and then only if one or more registered broker-dealer market makers comply with quotation requirements. In addition, delisting of our common stock could depress our stock price, substantially limit liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Delisting from the NYSE American could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities we cannot assure you that our common stock will be liquid or that it will remain listed on the NYSE American. A failure to regain compliance with the NYSE American stockholders\u2019 equity requirements or failure to continue to meet the other listing requirements could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nWe expect to seek to raise additional capital in the future, which may be dilutive to stockholders or impose operational restrictions.\nWe expect to seek to raise additional capital in the future to help fund development of our proposed products. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or of debt securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced. We may also enter into strategic transactions, issue equity as part of license issue fees to our licensors, compensate consultants or settle outstanding payables using equity that may be dilutive Our stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share and any additional equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share paid by existing stockholders, thereby subjecting such stockholders to dilution. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by existing stockholders, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. In the event that we sell shares or other securities at prices below the exercise price of the warrants that we issued in our October 2018 offering, the price protection anti-dilution provisions of the warrant provide that the exercise price of the warrants sold in our October 2018 offering is to be reduced which may result in additional warrant exercises and additional dilution to stockholders as was the case in 2020 and during the first quarter of 2021 when we utilized our at-the-market facility and the warrant exercise price was reduced. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by existing stockholders.\nHolders of our warrants issued in our October 2018 offering have no rights as common stockholders until they exercise their warrants and acquire our common stock.\nUntil the holders of the warrants we issued in our October 2018 offering acquire shares of our common stock by exercising their warrants, the holders of the warrants have no rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares of common stock underlying their securities. Upon exercise of the warrants they will be entitled to the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.\nWhether the outstanding warrants will have any value will depend on the market conditions for, and the price of, our common stock, which conditions will depend on factors related and unrelated to the success of our clinical development program, and cannot be predicted at this time. If our common stock price does not increase to an amount sufficiently above the exercise price of the warrants during the periods the warrants are exercisable, holders of warrants will be unable to recover any of their investment in the warrants\nBecause there is no established public trading market for the October 2018 warrants we issued, the liquidity of each such security is limited. We do not expect a market to develop, nor do we intend to apply to list the warrants on any securities exchange. Upon exercise of the warrants, our stockholders will experience dilution.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and adversely affected by various factors.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future. By way of example, on October 2, 2020, the price of our common stock closed at $0.32 per share while on February 9, 2021, our stock price closed at $1.10 per share with no discernable announcements or developments by the company or third parties. On January 5, 2021, the intra-day sales price of our common stock fluctuated between a reported low sale price of $0.93 and a reported high sales price of $1.70. We may incur rapid and substantial decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition, the recent outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused broad stock market and industry fluctuations. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:\n\u00b7 investor reaction to our business strategy;\n\u00b7 the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7 our continued compliance with the listing standards of the NYSE American;\n\u00b7 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products;\n\u00b7 results of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our products, clinical studies, manufacturing process or sales and marketing terms;\n\u00b7 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 the success of our efforts to acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates;\n\u00b7 developments concerning our collaborations or partners;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our products;\n\u00b7 our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u00b7 declines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u00b7 trading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u00b7 other events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of our suppliers or result in political or economic instability.\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Further, recent increases are significantly inconsistent with any improvements in actual or expected operating performance, financial condition or other indicators of value. Since the stock price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past, has been recently volatile and may be volatile in the future, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current prices or that future sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors.\nAdditionally, recently, securities of certain companies have experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. While we have no reason to believe our shares would be the target of a short squeeze, there can be no assurance that we won\u2019t be in the future, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws and Nevada law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur articles of incorporation, as amended, our amended and restated bylaws and Nevada law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. The Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of an additional series of preferred stock that would grant holders preferred rights to our assets upon liquidation, special voting rights, the right to receive dividends before dividends would be declared to common stockholders, and the right to the redemption of such shares, possibly together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the common stock. To the extent that we do issue additional preferred stock, the rights of holders of common stock could be impaired thereby, including without limitation, with respect to liquidation.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, as amended and our amended and restated bylaws may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. In particular, our articles of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, among other things:\n\u00b7 provide the board of directors with the ability to alter the bylaws without stockholder approval; and\n\u00b7 provide that vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum.\nOur failure to fulfill all of our registration requirements may cause us to suffer liquidated damages, which may be very costly.\nPursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement that we entered into with Intrexon and an affiliated entity, we were required to file a registration statement with respect to securities issued and are required to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement. The failure to do so could result in the payment of damages by us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement, and therefore there can be no assurance that we will not incur damages with respect to such agreements.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the operation and growth of our business and currently do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if the market price of our common stock price appreciates. Our Series A Preferred Stockholders rank senior to our common stockholders with respect to dividends.\nResales of our common stock in the public market by our stockholders may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nWe may issue common stock from time to time in connection with future offerings. Any issuance from time to time of new shares of our common stock, or our ability to issue shares of common stock in future offerings, could result in resales of our common stock by our current stockholders concerned about the potential dilution of their holdings. In turn, these resales could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock.\nThe shares of common stock offered under our current Amended and Restated At Market Issuance Sales Agreement may be sold in \u201cat the market\u201d offerings, and investors who buy shares at different times will likely pay different prices.\nInvestors who purchase shares that are sold under our current Amended and Restated At Market Issuance Sales Agreement at different times will likely pay different prices, and so may experience different outcomes in their investment results. We will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices, and numbers of shares sold, and there is no minimum or maximum sales price.\nInvestors may experience declines in the value of their shares as a result of share sales made at prices lower than the prices they paid.", "PERMNO": 92130, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SYN"}
