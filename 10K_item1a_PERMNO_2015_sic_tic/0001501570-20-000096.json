RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before you decide to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the disclosures in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, you could experience a partial or complete loss of your investment.\nRisks Related to Veritex\u2019s Business\nOur business concentration in Texas, and specifically the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area, imposes risks and may magnify the consequences of any regional or local economic downturn affecting the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area, including any downturn in the real estate sector.\nWe primarily conduct operations in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area. As of December 31, 2019, the substantial majority of the loans in our loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live and/or conduct business in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area, and the substantial majority of secured loans were secured by collateral located in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area. Accordingly, we are significantly exposed to risks associated with a lack of geographic diversification. The economic conditions in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area are highly dependent on the real estate sector as well as the technology, financial services, insurance, transportation, manufacturing and energy sectors. Any downturn or adverse development in these sectors, particularly the real estate sector, or a decline in the value of single-family homes in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and the Houston metropolitan area, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. Any adverse economic developments, among other things, could negatively affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of nonperforming assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of loans in our portfolio. Volatility in oil prices may have an impact on the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects (1) existing or prospective borrowers, (2) the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex or Houston metropolitan area or (3) property values in its market areas, may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our competitors whose operations are less geographically focused.\nUncertain market conditions and economic trends could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in an uncertain economic environment, including generally uncertain conditions nationally and locally in our industry and market. Financial institutions continue to be affected by volatility in the real estate market in some parts of the country and uncertain regulatory and interest rate conditions. We retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate market in Texas, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and Houston metropolitan area, and are affected by these events.\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our loan portfolio is made more complex by uncertain market and economic conditions. While certain economic conditions in the U.S. have shown signs of improvement in recent years, economic growth has been slow and uneven as consumers continue to recover from previously high unemployment rates, lower housing values, concerns about the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address this, as well as economic and political conditions in the global markets. Unfavorable economic trends, sustained high unemployment, and declines in real estate values can cause a reduction in the availability of commercial credit and can negatively impact the credit performance of commercial and consumer loans, resulting in increased write-downs. These negative trends can cause economic pressure on consumers and businesses and diminish confidence in the financial markets, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to access capital. A worsening of these conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial services industry.\nOur risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific industries and our credit approval practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. A national economic recession or deterioration of conditions in our market could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in one or more of the following consequences:\n\u2022increases in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022increases in nonperforming assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022decreases in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our liquidity position; and\n\u2022decreases in the value of the collateral securing our loans, especially real estate, which could reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power and repayment ability\nDeclines in real estate values, volume of home sales and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment, including job losses, could have an adverse effect on our borrowers and/or their customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rate shifts could reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, our earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of net interest income, or the difference between the interest income earned on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease net interest income because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive as of December 31, 2019, meaning that we estimate net interest income would increase more from rising interest rates than from falling interest rates.\nAn increase in interest rates may also, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume, loan portfolio and overall results. Although our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nAdditionally, interest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increases the potential for default and could result in a decrease in the demand for loans. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as borrowers refinance their loans at lower rates. In addition, in a low interest rate environment, loan customers often pursue long-term fixed rate credits, which could adversely affect our earnings and net interest margin if rates increase. Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities and other assets. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. At the same time, we continue to incur a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense on deposits and borrowings, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. We would incur a higher cost of funds to retain these deposits in a rising interest rate environment. Our net interest income could be adversely affected if the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings increase more rapidly than the rates we earn on loans and investment securities. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on our net interest income.\nA large portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial loans secured by receivables, promissory notes, inventory, equipment or other commercial collateral, the deterioration in value of which could increase the potential for future losses.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $1.7 billion, or 28.9%, of our total loans, consisted of commercial loans to businesses. In general, these loans are collateralized by general business assets including, among other things, accounts receivable, promissory notes, inventory and equipment, and most are backed by a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. These commercial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis. Additionally, the repayment of commercial loans is subject to the ongoing business operations of the borrower. The collateral securing such loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in\nvalue more rapidly than we anticipate, thereby exposing us to increased credit risk. A significant portion of our commercial loans are secured by promissory notes that evidence loans made by Veritex to borrowers that in turn make loans to others that are secured by real estate. Accordingly, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of the collateral securing these loans. Significant adverse changes in the economy or local market conditions in which our commercial lending customers operate could cause rapid declines in loan collectability and the values associated with general business assets resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose us to credit losses and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe phasing out and ultimate replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate and changes in the manner of calculating other reference rates may adversely impact the value of loans and other financial instruments we hold that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates in ways that are difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial condition.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021, and for LIBOR to be replaced with an alternative reference rate that will be calculated in a different manner. Our commercial and consumer businesses issue, trade and hold various products that are currently indexed to LIBOR. As of December 31, 2019, we had a material amount of loans, investment securities, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (the \u201cFHLB\u201d) and notional value of derivatives indexed to LIBOR that will mature after 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based instruments or arrangements. One of the major identified risks is inadequate fallback language in the various instruments\u2019 contracts that may result in issues establishing the alternative index and adjusting the margin as applicable. We have (1) established a cross-functional team to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the transition of LIBOR and other benchmark rates; (2) developed an inventory of affected products; and (3) implemented more robust fallback contract language.\nUncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities we have issued. If not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks to financial markets and institutions, including to Veritex. In addition, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nSignificant increases of nonperforming assets from the current level, or greater than anticipated costs to resolve these credits, will have an adverse effect on Veritex\u2019s earnings.\nOur nonperforming assets, which consist of non-accrual loans, assets acquired through foreclosure and troubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d), adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans and assets acquired through foreclosure. We must establish an allowance for loan losses which reserves for losses inherent in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable. From time to time, we also write down the value of properties in our portfolio of assets acquired through foreclosure to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to assets acquired through foreclosure. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract management from daily operations and other income producing activities. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance for loan losses accordingly, which will have an adverse effect on our earnings. Significant increases in the level of our nonperforming assets from the current level, or greater than anticipated costs to resolve these credits, will have an adverse effect on our earnings.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium-sized businesses. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which characteristics may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small or medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loans. If general economic conditions negatively impact the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, Houston metropolitan area or Texas generally, and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business developments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe establish an allowance for loan losses and maintain it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses based on our analysis of the loan portfolio and market environment. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available to us. Our allowance for loan losses consists of a general component based upon probable but unidentified losses inherent in the portfolio and a specific component based on individual loans that are considered impaired. The general component is based on various factors including historical loss experience, historical loss experience for peer banks, growth trends, loan concentrations, migration trends between internal loan risk ratings, current economic conditions and other qualitative factors. The specific component of the allowance for loan losses is calculated based on a review of individual loans considered impaired. The analysis of impaired losses may be based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective loan rate, an observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral on collateral dependent loans. In determining the collectability of certain loans, management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral. The amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic, operating or other conditions beyond ourcontrol, and any such differences may be material.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan losses was 0.50% of our total loans. Loans acquired are initially recorded at fair value, which includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition. Additional loan losses may occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we previously experienced. We may be required to take additional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan losses, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so or requirements by our banking regulators. In addition, bank regulatory agencies will periodically review the allowance for loan losses and the value attributed to non-accrual loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us to recognize future charge-offs. These adjustments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting policies, standards and interpretations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This update amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. We anticipate a significant change in the processes and procedures to calculate the loan losses, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. The change in methodology may result in material changes in our accounting for credit losses on financial instruments and create more volatility in our level of allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Refer to \u201cRecent Accounting\nPronouncements\u201d in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.\nWe may be unable to implement aspects of our growth strategy, which may affect our ability to maintain historical earnings trends.\nOur business has grown rapidly, with a strategy focused on organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions. Financial institutions that grow rapidly can experience significant difficulties as a result of rapid growth. We may be unable to execute on aspects of our growth strategy to sustain our historical rate of growth or may be unable to grow at all. More specifically, we may be unable to generate sufficient new loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances, obtain the personnel or funding necessary for additional growth or find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit the growth of our operations, the opening of new branches and the consummation of acquisitions. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect our growth. The success of our strategy also depends on our ability to effectively manage growth, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including the ability to adapt existing credit, operational, technology and governance infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. If we fail to build infrastructure sufficient to support rapid growth or fails to implement one or more aspects of our strategy, We may be unable to maintain historical earnings trends, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe intend to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions. An acquisition strategy involves significant risks, including the following:\n\u2022finding suitable candidates for acquisition;\n\u2022attracting funding to support additional growth within acceptable risk tolerances;\n\u2022maintaining asset quality;\n\u2022retaining customers and key personnel, including bankers;\n\u2022obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, which we may have difficulty obtaining or be unable to obtain;\n\u2022conducting adequate due diligence and managing known and unknown risks and uncertainties;\n\u2022integrating acquired businesses; and\n\u2022maintaining adequate regulatory capital.\nThe market for acquisition targets is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to find acquisition candidates that fit its strategy and standards. We face significant competition in pursuing acquisition targets from other banks and financial institutions, many of which possess greater financial, human, technical and other resources. Our ability to compete in acquiring target institutions will depend on the financial resources available to fund acquisitions, including the amount of cash and cash equivalents and the liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, increased competition may also drive up the acquisition consideration that we will be required to pay in order to successfully capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition targets, an important component of our growth strategy may not be realized.\nAcquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties, such as unknown or contingent liabilities with no available manner of recourse, exposure to unexpected problems such as asset quality, the retention of key employees and customers and other issues that could negatively affect our business. We may not be able to complete future acquisitions or, if completed, may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, technology platforms, management, products and services of the entities acquired or realize a reduction of redundancies. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from our management that would otherwise be directed toward servicing existing business and developing new business. Failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations in a timely or effective manner may increase our operating costs significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisition. In addition, the carrying amount of any goodwill that is currently maintained or that may be acquired may be subject to impairment in future periods.\nOur ability to retain bankers and recruit additional successful bankers is critical to the success of our business strategy, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur ability to retain and grow loans, deposits and fee income depends upon the business generation capabilities, reputation and relationship management skills of our bankers. If we were to lose the services of any of our bankers, including successful bankers employed by banks that we may acquire, to a new or existing competitor or otherwise, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our customers could choose to use the services of a competitor instead.\nOur growth strategy also relies on our ability to attract and retain additional profitable bankers. We may face difficulties in recruiting and retaining bankers of the desired caliber, including as a result of competition from other financial institutions. In particular, some of our competitors are significantly larger with greater financial resources, and may be able to offer more attractive compensation packages and broader career opportunities. Additionally, we may incur significant expenses and expend significant time and resources on training, integration and business development before we are able to determine whether a new banker will be profitable or effective. If we are unable to attract and retain successful bankers, or if its bankers fail to meet expectations in terms of customer relationships and profitability, we may be unable to execute our business strategy and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be adversely affected.\nLoss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could impair relationships with our customers and adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on the continued service and skills of its executive management team. Our goals, strategies and marketing efforts are closely tied to the banking philosophy and strengths of its executive management team. Our success is also dependent in part on the continued service of our market presidents and relationship managers. The loss of any of these key personnel could adversely affect our business because of their skills, years of industry experience, relationships with customers and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. We cannot guarantee that these executive officers or key employees will continue to be employed with us in the future.\nThe relatively unseasoned nature of a significant portion of our loan portfolio may expose us to increased credit risks.\nThe business of lending is inherently risky, including risks that the principal of or interest on any loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting the loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. Our loan portfolio has grown to $5.9 billion as of December 31, 2019, from $100.9 million as of December 31, 2010. This growth is related to both organic growth and loans acquired in connection with business acquisitions. The organic portion of this increase is due to increased loan production in the Texas markets in which we operate. It is difficult to assess the future performance of acquired or recently originated loans because our relatively limited experience with such loans does not provide us with a significant payment history from which to judge future collectability. These loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur commercial real estate and construction and land loan portfolios expose us to credit risks that could be greater than the risks related to other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $2.5 billion, or 42.1% of total loans, consisted of commercial real estate loans (including owner occupied commercial real estate loans) and $629.4 million, or 10.6% of total loans, consisted of construction and land loans. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate due to the fluctuation of real estate values. Additionally, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio could require us to increase the allowance for loan losses, which would reduce profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConstruction and land loans also involve risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are secured by a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. It can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project, and construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, we may be unable to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause a significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $4.0 billion, or 67.7% of total loans, consisted of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in the Texas markets in which we operate could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. Real estate values in many Texas markets have experienced periods of fluctuation over the last five years, and the market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, and could result in losses that adversely affect credit quality, financial condition and results of operations. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may need to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase the allowance for loan losses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n.\nWe may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the foreclosure on real estate assets securing our loan portfolio.\nHazardous or toxic substances or other environmental hazards may be located on the properties that secure our loans. If we acquire such properties as a result of foreclosure or otherwise, we could become subject to various environmental liabilities. For example, we could be held liable for the cost of cleaning up or otherwise addressing contamination at or from these properties. We could also be held liable to a governmental entity or third party for property damage, personal injury or other claims relating to any environmental contamination at or from these properties. In addition, we may own and operate certain properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks during any given fiscal year. At December 31, 2019, we did not own any foreclosed real estate assets. Although we have policies and procedures that are designed to mitigate certain environmental risks, we may not detect all environmental hazards associated with these properties. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to increased credit losses and credit related expenses in the event of a major natural disaster, public health crisis, other catastrophic event or significant climate change effects.\nThe occurrence of a major natural or environmental disaster, public health crisis or similar catastrophic event, as well as significant climate change effects such as rising sea levels or wildfires, especially in densely populated geographic areas, could increase our credit losses and credit related expenses. A natural disaster, public health crisis or catastrophic event or other significant climate change effect that either damages or destroys residential or multifamily real estate underlying mortgage loans or real estate collateral, or negatively affects the ability of borrowers to continue to make payments on loans, could increase our serious delinquency rates and average loan loss severity in the affected areas. Such events could also cause downturns in economic and market conditions generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We may not have adequate insurance coverage for some of these natural, catastrophic, public health or climate change-related events.\nWe have a concentration of loans outstanding to a limited number of borrowers, which may increase our risk of loss.\nWe have extended significant amounts of credit to a limited number of borrowers, and as of December 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of loans to our 10 and 25 largest borrowers (including related entities) amounted to $464.7 million, or 7.8% of total loans, and $906.1, or 15.3% of total loans, respectively. As of such date, none of these loans were nonperforming loans. Concentration of a significant amount of credit extended to a limited number of borrowers increases the risk in our loan portfolio. If one or more of these borrowers is unable to make payments of interest and principal in respect of such loans, the potential loss to us is more likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of liquidity could impair our ability to fund operations, adversely affect our operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of our investment securities, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity.\nOur most important source of funds is core deposits. Core deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other products, such as money market funds, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing funding costs and reducing net interest income and net income.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity and debt securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from our brokered deposit network, which includes the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (the \u201cFRB\u201d). We also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. Access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on acceptable terms, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Our access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the level of business activity as a result of a downturn in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex or the Houston metropolitan area or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against Veritex.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses or fulfill obligations such as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on liquidity and could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a limited operating history and, accordingly, investors will have little basis on which to evaluate its ability to achieve our business objectives.\nWe were formed as a bank holding company in 2009 and commenced banking operations in 2010. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business and future prospects. As a result, it is difficult, if not impossible, to predict future operating results and to assess the likelihood of the success of our business. As a relatively young financial institution, Veritex Bank is also subject to risks and levels of risk that are often greater than those encountered by financial institutions with longer established operations and relationships. New financial institutions often require significant capital from sources other than operations. Since we are a relatively new financial institution, our management team and employees will shoulder the burdens of the business operations and a workload associated with business growth and capitalization that is disproportionately greater than a more mature, established financial institution.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as the ability to maintain regulatory compliance, could be adversely affected.\nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. In addition, we, on a consolidated basis, and Veritex Bank, on a standalone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Importantly, regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels, which could require us to raise additional capital or reduce our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital if needed or on acceptable terms. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could recognize losses on investment securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nWhile we attempt to invest a significant percentage of our assets in loans (our loan to deposit ratio was 100.5% as of December 31, 2019), we also invest a percentage of our total assets in investment securities (12.5% as of December 31, 2019) with the primary objectives of providing a source of liquidity, providing an appropriate return on funds invested, managing interest rate risk, meeting pledging requirements and meeting regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio was $964.4 million, which included a net unrealized gain of $22.2 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities, and continued instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct our operations exclusively in Texas and particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and Houston metropolitan area. Many of our competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking services within the same market area. These competitors include banks with nationwide operations, regional banks and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based non-bank lenders and certain other non-financial entities, such as retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing or deposit terms than we can. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices, or otherwise solicit deposits, in our market area. Increased competition in our market may result in reduced loans and deposits, as well as reduced net interest margin, fee income and profitability. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue to grow loan and deposit portfolios, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022our ability to develop, build and maintain long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022customer satisfaction with our level of service;\n\u2022the ability to expand our market position; and\n\u2022industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative public opinion regarding Veritex or our failure to maintain our reputation in the community could adversely affect our business and prevent us from continuing to grow our business.\nAs a community bank, our reputation within the community we serve is critical to our success. We strive to enhance our reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities Veritex serves and delivering superior service to our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, we may be less successful in attracting new customers, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Further, negative public opinion could expose us to litigation and regulatory action as we seek to implement our growth strategy.\nWe may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely as a publicly listed company if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are required to file periodic reports containing our consolidated financial statements with the SEC within a specified time following the completion of quarterly and annual periods. Maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures is necessary to identify information we must disclose in our periodic reports and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary to produce reliable financial statements and to prevent fraud. If we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or effective internal control over financial reporting, we may experience difficulty in satisfying our SEC reporting obligations. Any failure by us to file our periodic reports with the SEC in a timely manner could harm our reputation and cause investors and potential investors to lose confidence in us and reduce the market price of our common stock, and could result in a suspension or delisting of our common stock.\nWe must also comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), which requires that we perform an annual evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. During the course of our evaluation and testing, we may identify deficiencies, including material weaknesses, which would have to be remediated to satisfy SEC rules for attesting to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined by the standards issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If a material weakness is determined to exist, we must disclose this deficiency in periodic reports we file with the SEC. The existence of a material weakness would preclude management from concluding that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and would also preclude our independent auditors from attesting to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, disclosures of this type in our SEC reports could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nMore generally, if we are unable to meet the demands that have been placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results in future periods, or report them within the timeframes required by law or stock exchange regulations. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could also potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Under such circumstances, we may be unable to implement the necessary internal controls in a timely manner, or at all, and future material weaknesses may exist or may be discovered. If we fail to implement the necessary improvements, or if material weaknesses or other deficiencies occur, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position could be impaired, which could result in late filings of our annual and quarterly reports with the SEC, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, a decline in our stock price, suspension or delisting of our common stock, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Even if we are able to report our financial statements accurately and in a timely manner, any failure in our efforts to implement the improvements or disclosure of material weaknesses in our future filings with the SEC could cause our reputation to be harmed and our stock price to decline significantly.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee or customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud, as well as insurance coverage designed to protect us from material losses associated with these risks, including losses resulting from any associated business interruption. If these internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans to originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which Veritex relies is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected, or we may fund a loan that it would not have funded or on terms we would not have extended. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or another third party, we will generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. A loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically\nunsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentations are often difficult to locate, and recovery of any of the resulting monetary losses we may suffer could be difficult.\nWe have a continuing need for technological change and may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations as it continues to grow and expand the products and services offered. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in an inability to fully realize the anticipated benefits from such new technology or significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.\nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to provide such products and services.\nOur operations could be interrupted if third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, we receive certain services from third parties including, but not limited to, core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems, online banking services, deposit processing and other processing services. Our operations could be interrupted if any of these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, particularly on a timely basis. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. In addition, we may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third-party failures, and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from interruptions of third-party services. Even if we are able to replace third-party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnauthorized access, cyber-crime and other threats to data security may require significant resources, harm our reputation, and otherwise cause harm to our business.\nWe necessarily collect, use and hold personal and financial information concerning individuals and businesses with which we have a banking relationship. This information includes non-public, personally identifiable information that is protected under applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, certain of these data processing functions are outsourced to third-party providers. Our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to threats to data security, security breaches, acts of vandalism and other physical security threats, computer viruses or compromises, ransomware attacks, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of our confidential business, employee or customer information, whether originating with us, our vendors or retail businesses, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of civil litigation and liability, require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking of costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a security breach, disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any damage, failure or security breach that causes breakdowns or disruptions in our general ledger, deposit, loan or other systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is difficult or impossible to defend against every risk being posed by changing technologies, as well as criminal intent on committing cyber-crime, and controls employed by our information technology department and our other employees and vendors could prove inadequate. Increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals and terrorists make keeping up with new threats difficult and could result in a breach. Cyber-security risks appear to be growing and, as a result, the cyber-resilience of banking organizations is of increased importance to federal and state banking agencies and other regulators. New or revised laws and regulations may significantly impact our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, the collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and employee information, and current or planned business activities. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products\nand services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. In the last few years, there have been an increasing number of cyber incidents, including several well-publicized cyber-attacks that targeted other U.S. companies, including financial services companies much larger than us. These cyber incidents have been initiated from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. As technology advances, the ability to initiate transactions and access data has also become more widely distributed among mobile devices, personal computers, automated teller machines, remote deposit capture sites and similar access points, some of which are not controlled or secured by us. It is possible that we could have exposure to liability and suffer losses as a result of a security breach or cyber-attack that occurred through no fault of Veritex. Further, the probability of a successful cyber-attack against us or one of our third-party service providers cannot be predicted. As cyber threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to spend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective and preventative measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may also become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, and viruses and malware.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing consumers to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds, general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards or other mobile payment services. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, which may increase as consumers become more comfortable with these new technologies and offerings, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the goodwill that we have recorded or may record in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require charges to earnings, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeded the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with the purchase of another financial institution. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs which indicates that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amounts, including goodwill. We have an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test, and we may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity shall perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. Under the first step, the estimation of fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If step one indicates a potential impairment, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. If the carrying amount of the reporting goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in the results of operations in the periods in which they become known. As of December 31, 2019, goodwill totaled $370.8 million. Although we have not recorded any impairment charges since the goodwill was initially recorded, future evaluations of existing goodwill or goodwill acquired in the future may result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Veritex\u2019s Industry and Regulation\nThe ongoing changes in regulation could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. This statute and the implementing regulations have imposed significant regulatory and compliance changes on many industries, including ours. The enactment of EGRRCPA in 2018 and other rulemaking by the agencies may impose other costs or provide regulatory relief. This evolving regulatory framework may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, require the development of new compliance infrastructure, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or failure to comply with them, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect our shareholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers, depositors, the DIF, and the overall financial stability of the United States. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividends or distributions that the Bank can pay to Veritex, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles would require. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nState and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations, and failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or may become subject as a result of such examinations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTexas and federal banking agencies, including the TDB and the Federal Reserve, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a Texas or federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that Veritex, the Bank or their respective management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to prohibit \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital levels, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against Veritex, the Bank or their respective officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance upon notice and hearing. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.\nMany of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict future growth.\nWe intend to complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and other complementary businesses. Generally, we must receive state and federal regulatory approval before we can acquire a depository institution insured by the FDIC or related business. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, our financial condition, our future prospects and the impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution\u2019s record of compliance under the CRA) and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may also be required to sell branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, as opportunities arise, we plan to continue de novo branching as a part of its organic growth strategy. De novo branching and any acquisitions carry with them numerous risks, including the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals. The failure to obtain these regulatory approvals for potential future strategic acquisitions and de novo branches could impact our business plans and restrict our growth.\nFinancial institutions, such as the Bank, face a risk of noncompliance with and enforcement action under the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Department of\nthe Treasury, or the Treasury Department, to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements, and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nIn order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, we have dedicated significant resources to our Bank Secrecy Act anti-money laundering programs. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plans, such as acquisitions and de novo branching.\nWe are subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the Justice Department and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nThe FDIC\u2019s restoration plan and the related increased assessment rate could adversely affect our earnings and results of operations.\nAs a result of economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC revised its deposit insurance assessment methodology, which has had the effect of raising deposit premiums for many insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the DIF to meet its funding requirements, special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional financial institution failures that affect the DIF, we may be required to pay FDIC premiums higher than current levels. Our FDIC insurance related costs were $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The decrease in FDIC insurance related costs during 2019 was a result of FDIC applied credits to small banks as a result of the DIF exceeding its reserve ratio. If a bank acquired another bank that was owed credits through merger or consolidation after the reserve ratio was exceeded, the acquiring bank is considered successor to any credits of the acquired small bank. As such, Green's credit was included in the FDIC insurance related costs for 2019. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could adversely affect our earnings and results of operations.\nWe are subject to increased capital requirements, which may adversely impact return on equity or prevent us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based and leverage capital requirements to apply to banks and bank and savings and loan holding companies. In 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted revised risk-based and leverage capital requirements as well as a revised method for calculating risk-weighted assets. The capital rules apply to all bank holding companies with $1 billion or more in consolidated assets and all banks regardless of size.\nThe revised capital rules subjected us to higher required capital levels on January 1, 2015, with a phase-in period for certain provisions over four years that began in 2016. As of January 1, 2019, the capital requirements were fully phased in. The application of more stringent capital requirements on us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions such as the inability to pay dividends or repurchase shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nEGRRCPA provides for a new community bank leverage ratio of between 8% and 10% for banking organizations with no more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets in place of the current risk-based and leverage capital requirements, including the capital conservation buffer. The federal banking agencies are still developing a regulation for this leverage ratio and we cannot currently predict the possible impact of those regulations on our business at this time.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nA bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank at times when the bank holding company may not be inclined to do so and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failing to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Accordingly, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\nSuch a capital injection may be required at a time when our resources are limited and we may be required to borrow the funds to make the required capital injection. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of any note obligations.\nWe could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due. Any such losses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the U.S. money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of both the discount rate and the federal funds rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Although we cannot determine the effects of such policies on us at this time, such policies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of Our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022the public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions, innovations or new programs and services;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts that cover our common stock or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022general economic conditions and overall market fluctuations;\n\u2022the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022changes in business, legal or regulatory conditions, or other developments affecting participants in our industry, and publicity regarding our business or any of our significant customers or competitors;\n\u2022changes in governmental monetary policies, including the policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock by us or our directors, executive officers or significant shareholders; and\n\u2022changes in economic conditions in and political conditions affecting our target markets.\nIn particular, the realization of any of the risks described in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and cause the value of your investment to decline. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock over the short, medium or long-term, regardless of our actual performance. If the market price of our common stock reaches an elevated level, it may materially and rapidly decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were to be involved in a class action lawsuit, it could divert the attention of senior management and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about Veritex or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, either absolutely or relative to our competitors, our stock price could decline significantly.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of the common stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments and pursuant to compensation and incentive plans. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of its common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition or under a compensation or incentive plan), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of its securities.\nThe holders of our debt obligations will have priority over our common stock with respect to payment in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Veritex and with respect to the payment of interest and preferred dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $115.0 million outstanding in aggregate principal amount of subordinated promissory notes held by investors, and, in the aggregate, $33.9 million of junior subordinated debentures issued to four statutory trusts that in turn issued $32.9 million in the aggregate of trust preferred securities. In the future, we may incur additional indebtedness. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets until after all of our obligations to our debt holders have been satisfied and holders of trust preferred securities have received any payment or distribution due to them. In addition, we are required to pay interest on our outstanding indebtedness before we pay any dividends on our common stock. Since any decision to issue debt securities or incur other borrowings in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts is uncertain. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future issuances of debt securities or our incurrence of other borrowings will negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe depend on the Bank for cash flow, and the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions is restricted, which could impact our ability to satisfy its obligations.\nOur primary asset is the Bank. As such, we depend upon the Bank for cash distributions through dividends on the Bank\u2019s stock to pay our operating expenses and satisfy our obligations, including debt obligations. There are numerous laws and banking regulations that limit the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to Veritex. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Veritex, we will not be able to satisfy our obligations. Federal and state statutes and regulations restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions to Veritex. These statutes and regulations require, among other things, that the Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. Further, federal and state banking authorities have the ability to restrict the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends through supervisory action.\nOur dividend policy may change without notice, our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions, and we may not pay dividends in the future.\nIn January 2019, we initiated a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, investment opportunities, growth opportunities, any legal, regulatory, contractual or other limitations on our ability to pay dividends and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. As a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is also affected by the policies and enforcement powers of the Federal Reserve and any future payment of dividends will depend on the Bank\u2019s ability to make distributions and payments to Veritex as our principal source of funds to pay such dividends. Veritex Bank is also subject to various legal, regulatory and other restrictions on its ability to make distributions and payments to Veritex. In addition, in the future, we may enter into borrowing or other contractual arrangements that restrict its ability to pay dividends. As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common stock. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. See also \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation and Supervision-Regulatory Limits on Dividends and Distributions.\u201d\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management.\nWe completed our initial public offering in October 2014. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We also incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, stock exchange rules and the rules implemented by the SEC. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nShareholders may be deemed to be acting in concert or otherwise in control of us, which could impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements upon them and result in adverse regulatory consequences for such holders.\nVeritex is a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve. Banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution or a company that controls an FDIC-insured depository institution, such as a bank holding company. These laws include the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act. The determination as to whether an investor \u201ccontrols\u201d a depository institution or holding company is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment.\nAs a general matter, a party is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the party (1) owns or controls 25.0% or more of any class of voting stock of the bank or other company, (2) controls the election of a majority of the directors of the bank or other company, or (3) has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or other company. In addition, subject to rebuttal, a party may be presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10.0% or more of any class of voting stock. Ownership by affiliated parties, or parties acting in concert, is typically aggregated for these purposes. \u201cActing in concert\u201d generally means knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards the common goal of acquiring control of a bank or a parent company, whether or not pursuant to an express agreement. The manner in which this definition is applied in individual circumstances can vary and cannot always be predicted with certainty.\nAny shareholder that is deemed to \u201ccontrol\u201d us for regulatory purposes would become subject to notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements and may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences. Potential investors are advised to consult with their legal counsel regarding the applicable regulations and requirements.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is not guaranteed by the FDIC, so you could lose some or all of your investment.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss or guaranteed by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. An investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 15022, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "VBTX"}
