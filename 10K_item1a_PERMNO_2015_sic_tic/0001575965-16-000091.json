{"cik": "1575965", "company": "Gaming & Leisure Properties, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nWe are dependent on Penn (including its subsidiaries) until we substantially diversify our portfolio, and an event that has a material adverse effect on Penn's business, financial position or results of operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nA subsidiary of Penn is the lessee of substantially all of our properties pursuant to the Penn Master Lease and accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. Additionally, because the Penn Master Lease is a triple-net lease, we depend on Penn to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with these leased properties and to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with its business. There can be no assurance that Penn will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its payment obligations under the Penn Master Lease. The inability or unwillingness of Penn to meet its subsidiary's rent obligations and other obligations under the Penn Master Lease could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders as required to maintain our status as a REIT. For these reasons, if Penn were to experience a material adverse effect on its gaming business, financial position or results of operations, our business, financial position or results of operations could also be materially adversely affected.\nDue to our dependence on rental payments from Penn and its tenant subsidiary as our main source of revenues, we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under the Penn Master Lease or to terminate the lease with respect to a particular property. Failure by Penn's tenant subsidiary to comply with the terms of the Penn Master Lease or to comply with the gaming regulations to which the leased properties are subject could require us to find another lessee for such leased property and there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by Penn. In such event, we may be unable to locate a suitable lessee at similar rental rates or at all, which would have the effect of significantly reducing our rental revenues.\nFollowing the completion of the Pinnacle transaction, we will be significantly dependent on two tenants and their respective subsidiaries and substantially all of our revenues will be based on the revenue derived under the master leases with Pinnacle and Penn. We will continue to be subject to the risks described above.\nOur pursuit of investments in, and acquisitions or development of, additional properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, lenders, gaming companies (including gaming companies considering REIT structures) and other investors, some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources and lower costs of capital. Increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives. If we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of gaming properties and other properties at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business, financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, the fact that we must distribute 90% of our net taxable income in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT may limit our ability to rely upon rental\npayments from our leased properties or subsequently acquired properties in order to finance acquisitions. As a result, if debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms, further acquisitions might be limited or curtailed and completing proposed acquisitions may be adversely impacted. Furthermore, fluctuations in the price of our common stock may impact our ability to finance additional acquisitions through the issuance of common stock and/or cause significant dilution.\nInvestments in and acquisitions of gaming properties and other properties we might seek to acquire entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including that the investment's performance will fail to meet expectations, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will underperform. Real estate development projects present other risks, including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis, and the incurrence of significant development costs prior to completion of the project.\nWe may not complete the acquisition of substantially all of Pinnacle\u2019s real property assets within the time frame we anticipate or at all, which could have a negative effect on our business and our results of operations.\nOn July 20, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire substantially all of Pinnacle\u2019s real property assets. In connection with the acquisition, Pinnacle has agreed that it will effect the separation of its real property assets and gaming and other operating assets and effect a pro rata distribution to its stockholders of common stock representing a 100% interest in a newly formed public company that will own Pinnacle\u2019s gaming operating assets and other specified assets (the \"Pinnacle Spin-Off\"). Immediately following the Pinnacle Spin-Off, we will acquire substantially all of Pinnacle\u2019s real property assets through the merger of Pinnacle with and into one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions, such as the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Pinnacle common stock; the approval of the issuance of shares of our common stock as merger consideration by a majority vote of the holders of our common stock; the absence of any governmental order or law prohibiting the consummation of the transactions, including the Pinnacle Spin-Off; the effectiveness of the registration statement for our common stock to be issued as merger consideration; the effectiveness of the Pinnacle Spin-Off registration statement and completion of the Pinnacle Spin-Off, and the receipt of the required anti-trust and other regulatory approvals. These conditions may not be satisfied or may take longer than expected to be satisfied. The transaction is also subject to other risks and uncertainties.\nWe have already devoted substantial time and resources and incurred substantial costs in connection with the transaction, many of which must be paid even if the acquisition is not completed. In addition, we will generally be obligated to pay a termination fee of $150 million to Pinnacle if the acquisition is terminated because the required regulatory approvals were not obtained. We also could be required to pay an expense reimbursement fee of up to $20 million to Pinnacle if the acquisition is terminated because our shareholders fail to approve the issuance of our common stock in connection with the Merger. The payment of any of these costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that the acquisition will be completed or that there will not be a delay in the completion of the acquisition. Furthermore, our ability to raise the amount of capital necessary to fund the acquisition of the Pinnacle real estate assets is subject to market and economic conditions. If the acquisition is not consummated, our reputation in our industry and in the investment community could be damaged, and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIf the acquisition of substantially all of Pinnacle\u2019s real property assets is completed, we may not achieve the intended benefits and the acquisition may disrupt our current plans or operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully realize the expected benefits of the acquisition. Following the completion of the acquisition, we will have significant financial exposure to Pinnacle\u2019s performance of its contractual obligations to us, and adverse changes in Pinnacle\u2019s business or finances, over which we will have no control other than the limited contractual protections afforded to us as a landlord, could adversely affect us. We also may not be able to finance the acquisition on attractive terms, which could result in increased costs, substantial dilution to our shareholders and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, our business may be negatively impacted following the acquisition if we are unable to effectively manage our expanded operations.\nThe transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, could have material and adverse effects on us.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval by GLPI shareholders of the share issuance proposal, approval by Pinnacle stockholders of the Merger Agreement proposal and consummation of the spin-off,\nwhich make the completion and timing of the completion of the transactions uncertain. Also, either GLPI or Pinnacle may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been consummated by March 31, 2016 or, in GLPI\u2019s sole discretion-if the only conditions to closing that have not been satisfied or waived by that date are those related to regulatory approvals, consents or clearances, an outstanding judgment, injunction, order or law of a governmental authority prohibiting or enjoining the transactions or an action pending before, or threatened in writing by, the U.S. Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission that would prevent the performance of the transactions-June 30, 2016, except that this right to terminate the Merger Agreement will not be available to any party whose material breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of such party under the Merger Agreement resulted in the failure of the transactions to be consummated on or before that date.\nIf the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not completed on a timely basis, or at all, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the transactions, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay our costs relating to the transactions, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the transactions are completed;\n\u2022\ntime and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the transactions could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the transactions will be completed.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn connection with the pendency of the transactions, it is possible that certain persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us, as the case may be, as a result of the transactions, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, Pinnacle and GLPI are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their business prior to the effective time of the Merger, which may adversely affect their respective abilities to execute certain of their business strategies, including, the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures. Such limitations could negatively affect Pinnacle\u2019s businesses and operations prior to the completion of the transactions.\nThe Merger is subject to the receipt of approvals, consents or clearances from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the transactions.\nCompletion of the Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental approvals, including, without limitation, gaming regulatory approvals. Although each party has agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals, there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained and that the other conditions to completing the Merger will be satisfied. In addition, the governmental authorities from which the regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger or other agreements to be entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding consummation of the transaction or of imposing additional costs or limitations on GLPI or Pinnacle following completion of the Merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on GLPI or Pinnacle following completion of the Merger. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, however, (i) subject to certain conditions, Pinnacle is not required to agree to amendments to the Pinnacle Master Lease Agreement or take certain divestiture actions and (ii) GLPI is not required to take any divesture actions that would be expected to result in a loss of $150 million or more. One or more divesture actions, in the aggregate, that would reasonably be expected to result in a loss of $150 million or more is referred to in this Form 10-K as a \"Regulatory MAE.\" For additional information about the regulatory approvals process, see \"The Merger-Regulatory Approvals\" section of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.\nThe completion of the transactions may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Pinnacle is a party. If GLPI and Pinnacle are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if GLPI and Pinnacle are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Pinnacle.\nWe are subject to provisions under the Merger Agreement that, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay a termination fee of up to $150 million to Pinnacle.\nAs discussed in the risk factor above, completion of the Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental approvals. If regulatory approvals are not obtained as a result of a Regulatory MAE and the Merger Agreement is terminated by GLPI or Pinnacle under certain conditions, then, so long as the primary cause of such termination was not an adverse suitability finding under gaming laws with respect to the business of OpCo and its affiliates, GLPI will be required to pay Pinnacle a termination fee of $150 million, less any expense payments previously paid. In addition, GLPI will be required to pay Pinnacle a termination fee of $150 million, less any expense payments previously paid, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by either GLPI or Pinnacle because there is a permanent injunction restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and the injunction has become final and nonappelable, so long as the primary cause of such termination was not an adverse suitability finding under gaming laws with respect to the business of OpCo and its affiliates. For more information, see the section titled \"The Merger Agreement-Expenses and Termination Fees Relating to the Termination of the Merger Agreement\" of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.\nIf such a termination fee is payable under any such circumstance, the payment of this fee could have material and adverse consequences to the financial condition and operations of GLPI.\nFollowing the Merger, the market price of GLPI common stock may be volatile, and holders of GLPI\u2019s common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment due to drops in the market price of GLPI\u2019s common stock following completion of the transactions.\nThe market price of GLPI\u2019s common stock may be volatile, and following completion of the Merger, shareholders may not be able to resell their shares of GLPI common stock at or above the price at which they acquired the common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement or otherwise due to fluctuations in its market price, including changes in price caused by factors unrelated to GLPI\u2019s performance or prospects.\nSpecific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for GLPI\u2019s common stock include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding GLPI\u2019s common stock or other comparable REITs;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in GLPI\u2019s revenue stream or future prospects;\n\u2022\nreaction to public announcements by GLPI following the Merger;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions taken by GLPI or its competitors, such as acquisitions;\n\u2022\nfailure of GLPI to achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger, including financial results, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to GLPI\u2019s business and operations or the gaming industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax or accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nadverse conditions in the financial markets or general U.S. or international economic conditions, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism and responses to such events; and\n\u2022\nsales of GLPI common stock by Pinnacle stockholders, members of GLPI\u2019s management team or other significant shareholders.\nUnder the separation agreement, Pinnacle will have to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that these indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Pinnacle\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nUnder the separation agreement, Pinnacle will agree to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Pinnacle will agree to retain, and there can be no assurance that Pinnacle will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Pinnacle\nany amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from Pinnacle.\nWe are expected to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the Pinnacle transactions.\nWe are expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the transactions. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the expenses.\nWe are dependent on the gaming industry and may be susceptible to the risks associated with it, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nAs the owner of gaming facilities, we are impacted by the risks associated with the gaming industry. Therefore, our success is to some degree dependent on the gaming industry, which could be adversely affected by economic conditions in general, changes in consumer trends and preferences and other factors over which we and our tenants have no control. As we are subject to risks inherent in substantial investments in a single industry, a decrease in the gaming business would likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio, particularly because a component of the rent under the Penn Master Lease is based, over time, on the performance of the gaming facilities operated by Penn on our properties.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an increasing number of gaming facilities with an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, land-based casinos, video lottery, sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming and other forms of gaming in the U.S. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings, could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our TRS Properties and the business of our tenants and, indirectly, our business. Such internet wagering services are often illegal under federal law but operate exclusively in certain states and from overseas locations, and are accessible to certain domestic gamblers. Currently, there are proposals that would legalize internet poker and other varieties of internet gaming in a number of states and at the federal level. Several states, including Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware, have enacted legislation authorizing intrastate internet gaming and internet gaming operations have begun in these states. Expansion of internet gaming in other jurisdictions (both legal and illegal) could further compete with our traditional operations, which could have an adverse impact on our business and result of operations.\nThe operations of our TRS Properties and of our tenants in our leased facilities are subject to disruptions or reduced patronage as a result of severe weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualty events. Because many of our facilities are located on or adjacent to bodies of water, they are subject to risks in addition to those associated with land-based facilities, including loss of service due to casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, flood, hurricane or other severe weather conditions. A component of the rent under the Penn Master Lease is based, over time, on the performance of the gaming facilities operated by Penn on our properties; consequently, a casualty that leads to the loss of use of a casino facility subject to the Penn Master Lease for an extended period may negatively impact our revenues.\nWe face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities.\nThe ownership, operation, and management of gaming and racing facilities are subject to pervasive regulation. These regulations impact both our ownership and operation of the TRS Properties and the operations of our gaming tenants. Our ownership and operation of the TRS Properties subject GLPI and its officers and directors to the jurisdiction of the gaming regulatory agencies in Louisiana and Maryland. Further, many gaming and racing regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which our tenants operate require GLPI and its affiliates to maintain a license as a key business entity or supplier because of GLPI's status as landlord.\nIn many jurisdictions, gaming laws can require certain of our shareholders to file an application, be investigated, and qualify or have his, her or its suitability determined by gaming authorities. Gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant should be deemed suitable. Subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved, for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities.\nMany jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and, in some jurisdictions, non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to gaming authorities, and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability, subject to limited exceptions for \"institutional investors\" that hold a company's voting securities for investment purposes only.\nSome jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest.\nAdditionally, substantially all material loans, significant acquisitions, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by GLPI and its subsidiaries must be reported to and in some cases approved by gaming authorities. Neither GLPI nor any of its subsidiaries may make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain gaming authorities. Changes in control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or otherwise are subject to receipt of prior approval of gaming authorities. Entities seeking to acquire control of GLPI or one of its subsidiaries must satisfy gaming authorities with respect to a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control.\nRequired regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our gaming properties, which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive rent for such properties.\nThe tenants of our gaming properties are operators of gaming facilities, which operators must be licensed under applicable state law. Prior to the transfer of gaming facilities, the new operator generally must become licensed under state law. In the event that the Penn Master Lease or any future lease agreement we enter into is terminated or expires and a new tenant is found, any delays in the new tenant receiving regulatory approvals from the applicable state government agencies, or the inability to receive such approvals, may prolong the period during which we are unable to collect the applicable rent.\nOur charter restricts the ownership and transfer of our outstanding stock, which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or change of control of our company.\nIn order for GLPI to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, not more than 50% in value of its outstanding shares of stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year after the first year for which GLPI elected to qualify to be taxed as a REIT (2014). Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own GLPI stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year (other than the first taxable year for which GLPI elects to be taxed as a REIT). GLPI's charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes the Board of Directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve GLPI's qualification as a REIT. GLPI's charter also provides that, subject to certain exceptions exempted by the Board of Directors, no person may beneficially or constructively own more than 7% in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive, of GLPI's outstanding shares of all classes and series of stock. The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control of GLPI that might involve a premium price for shares of GLPI stock or otherwise be in the best interests of GLPI shareholders. The acquisition of less than 7% of our outstanding stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own beneficially or constructively in excess of 7% in value of our outstanding stock, and thus violate our charter's ownership limit. Our charter prohibits any person from owning shares of our stock that would result in our being \"closely held\" under Section 856(h) of the Code. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the transfer being automatically void. GLPI's charter also provides that shares of GLPI's capital stock acquired or held in excess of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and that any person who acquires shares of GLPI's capital stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the market price on the day the shares were transferred to the trust or the amount realized from the sale. GLPI or its designee will have the right to purchase the shares from the trustee at this calculated price as well. A transfer of shares of GLPI's capital stock in violation of the limit may be void under certain circumstances. GLPI's 7% ownership limitation may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of GLPI, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for GLPI's shareholders. To assist GLPI in complying with applicable gaming laws, our charter also provides that capital stock of GLPI that is owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or an affiliate of an unsuitable person will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and that any such unsuitable person or affiliate will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid by the unsuitable person or affiliate for the shares or the amount realized from the sale, in each case less a discount in a percentage (up to 100%) to be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion. The shares shall additionally be redeemable by GLPI, out of funds legally available for that redemption, to the extent required by the gaming authorities making the determination of unsuitability or to the extent determined to be necessary or advisable by our Board of Directors, at a redemption price equal to the lesser of (i) the market price on the date of the redemption notice, (ii) the market price on the redemption date, or (iii) the actual amount paid for the shares by the owner thereof, in each case less a discount in a percentage (up to 100%) to be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole and absolute discretion.\nPennsylvania law and provisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent takeover attempts by third parties and therefore inhibit GLPI's shareholders from realizing a premium on their stock.\nGLPI's charter and bylaws, in addition to Pennsylvania law, contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with GLPI's Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. GLPI's charter and bylaws, among other things (i) permit the Board of Directors, without further action of the shareholders, to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock, which may have rights senior to those of the common stock; (ii) establish certain advance notice procedures for shareholder proposals, and require all director candidates to be recommended by the nominating committee of the Board of Directors; (iii) classify our Board of Directors into three separate classes with staggered terms; (iv) provide that a director may only be removed by shareholders for cause and upon the vote of 75% of the shares entitled to vote; (v) not permit direct nomination by shareholders of nominees for election to the Board of Directors, but instead permit shareholders to recommend potential nominees to the compensation and governance committee; (vi) require shareholders to have beneficially owned at least 1% of the outstanding GLPI common stock in order to recommend a person for nomination for election to the Board of Directors, or to present a shareholder proposal, for action at a shareholders meeting; and (vii) provide for supermajority approval requirements for amending or repealing certain provisions in our charter and in order to approve an amendment or repeal of any provision of our bylaws that has not been proposed by our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, specific anti-takeover provisions in Pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions require (i) approval of certain transactions by a majority of the voting stock other than that held by the potential acquirer; (ii) the acquisition at \"fair value\" of all the outstanding shares not held by an acquirer of 20% or more; (iii) a five-year moratorium on certain \"business combination\" transactions with an \"interested shareholder;\" (iv) the loss by interested shareholders of their voting rights over \"control shares;\" (v) the disgorgement of profits realized by an interested shareholder from certain dispositions of GLPI shares; and (vi) severance payments for certain employees and prohibiting termination of certain labor contracts.\nGLPI's believes these provisions will protect its shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with GLPI's Board of Directors and by providing GLPI's Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make GLPI immune from takeovers or to prevent a transaction from occurring. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that GLPI's Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of GLPI. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nOur management team, including chairman and chief executive officer, Peter M. Carlino, and chief financial officer, William J. Clifford, has limited experience operating a REIT.\nThe requirements for qualifying as a REIT are highly technical and complex. Our management team, including chairman and chief executive officer, Peter M. Carlino, and chief financial officer, William J. Clifford, has limited experience in complying with the income, asset and other limitations imposed by the REIT provisions of the Code. Any failure to comply with those provisions in a timely manner could prevent GLPI from qualifying as a REIT or could force GLPI to pay unexpected taxes and penalties. In such event, GLPI's net income would be reduced and GLPI could incur a loss, which could materially harm its business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, there is no assurance that their past experience with the acquisition, development and disposition of gaming facilities will be sufficient to enable them to successfully manage GLPI's portfolio of properties as required by its business plan or the REIT provisions of the Code.\nIf we lose our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.\nOur success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team, particularly Peter M. Carlino, our chief executive officer, and William J. Clifford, our chief financial officer. If we lose the services of Messrs. Carlino or Clifford, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. Furthermore, the Company does not have any employment agreements in place with the members of its executive management team at this time.\nWe may experience uninsured or underinsured losses, which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property, decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense.\nWhile the Penn Master Lease requires, and new lease agreements are expected to require, that comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance be maintained by the tenants, a tenant's failure to comply could lead to an uninsured or underinsured loss and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover such uninsured or underinsured amounts from such tenant. Futher, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. Insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or\ncurrent replacement cost of a loss. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore the economic position with respect to such property.\nIf we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our policy coverage limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties were subject to recourse indebtedness, we could continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if these properties were irreparably damaged.\nIn addition, even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance, a disruption of our business caused by a casualty event may result in the loss of business or tenants. The business interruption insurance we carry may not fully compensate us for the loss of business or tenants due to an interruption caused by a casualty event. Further, if one of our tenants has insurance but is underinsured, that tenant may be unable to satisfy its payment obligations under its lease with us.\nA disruption in the financial markets may make it more difficult to evaluate the stability, net assets and capitalization of insurance companies and any insurer's ability to meet its claim payment obligations. A failure of an insurance company to make payments to us upon an event of loss covered by an insurance policy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nOur stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as variations in operating results, changes in market interest rates, actions by various regulatory agencies and legislatures, operating competition, market perceptions, progress with respect to potential acquisitions, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the actions of rating agencies, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments.\nAs an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Although we will not operate or manage most of our property, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release.\nIn addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property's value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Further, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination.\nAlthough we intend to require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities, including environmental liabilities they cause, the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Status of GLPI as a REIT\nIf GLPI does not qualify to be taxed as a REIT, or fails to remain qualified as a REIT, GLPI will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders of GLPI.\nGLPI elected on its 2014 U.S. federal income tax return to be treated as a REIT and intends to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit it to qualify as a REIT. GLPI currently operates, and intends to continue to operate, in a manner that will allow GLPI to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. GLPI received an opinion from its special tax advisors, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and KPMG LLP (collectively the \"Special Tax Advisors\"), with respect to its qualification as a REIT in connection with the Spin-Off. Investors should be aware, however, that opinions of advisors are not binding on the IRS or any court. The opinions of the Special Tax Advisors represent only the view of the Special Tax Advisors based on their review and analysis of existing law and on certain representations as to factual matters and covenants made by GLPI, including representations relating to the values of GLPI's assets and the sources of GLPI's income. The opinions are expressed as of the date issued. The Special Tax Advisors have no obligation to advise GLPI or the holders of GLPI common stock of any subsequent change in the matters stated, represented or assumed or of any\nsubsequent change in applicable law. Furthermore, both the validity of the opinions of Special Tax Advisors and GLPI's qualification as a REIT will depend on GLPI's satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis, the results of which will not be monitored by the Special Tax Advisors. GLPI's ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon GLPI's analysis of the characterization and fair market values of its assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which GLPI will not obtain independent appraisals.\nPenn has received a private letter ruling from the IRS with respect to certain issues relevant to GLPI's qualification as a REIT. In general, the ruling provides, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, that (1) certain of the assets to be held by GLPI after the Spin-Off and (2) the methodology for calculating a certain portion of rent received by GLPI pursuant to the Penn Master Lease will not adversely affect GLPI's qualification as a REIT. Although GLPI may generally rely upon the ruling, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge GLPI's qualification as a REIT on the basis of other issues or facts outside the scope of the ruling.\nIf GLPI were to fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT in any taxable year, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on its taxable income at regular corporate rates, and dividends paid to GLPI shareholders would not be deductible by GLPI in computing its taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to its shareholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of GLPI common stock. Unless GLPI were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, GLPI also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which GLPI failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nQualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize GLPI's REIT qualification. GLPI's qualification as a REIT will depend on its satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. In addition, GLPI's ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify to be taxed as a REIT may depend in part on the actions of third parties over which it has no control or only limited influence.\nGLPI could fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT if income it receives from Penn or its subsidiaries is not treated as qualifying income.\nUnder applicable provisions of the Code, GLPI will not be treated as a REIT unless it satisfies various requirements, including requirements relating to the sources of its gross income. Rents received or accrued by GLPI from Penn or its subsidiaries will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if the Penn Master Lease is not respected as a true lease for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is instead treated as a service contract, joint venture or some other type of arrangement. If the Penn Master Lease is not respected as a true lease for U.S. federal income tax purposes, GLPI may fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT. Furthermore, GLPI's qualification as a REIT will depend on GLPI's satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. GLPI's ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon GLPI's analysis of the characterization and fair market values of its assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which GLPI will not obtain independent appraisals.\nIn addition, subject to certain exceptions, rents received or accrued by GLPI from Penn or its subsidiaries will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if GLPI or an actual or constructive owner of 10% or more of GLPI stock actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Penn stock entitled to vote or 10% or more of the total value of all classes of Penn stock. GLPI's charter provides for restrictions on ownership and transfer of its shares of stock, including restrictions on such ownership or transfer that would cause the rents received or accrued by GLPI from Penn or its subsidiaries to be treated as non-qualifying rent for purposes of the REIT gross income requirements. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that such restrictions will be effective in ensuring that rents received or accrued by GLPI from Penn or its subsidiaries will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of REIT qualification requirements.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to income from \"qualified dividends\" payable by U.S. corporations to U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is currently 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. Although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts or estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including GLPI's stock.\nREIT distribution requirements could adversely affect GLPI's ability to execute its business plan.\nGLPI generally must distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, in order for GLPI to qualify to be taxed as a REIT (assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied) so that U.S. federal corporate income tax does not apply to earnings that GLPI distributes. To the extent that GLPI satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation as a REIT but distributes less than 100% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains, GLPI will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net taxable income. In addition, GLPI will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that GLPI distributes to its shareholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. GLPI intends to make distributions to its shareholders to comply with the REIT requirements of the Code.\nFrom time to time, GLPI may generate taxable income greater than its cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. If GLPI does not have other funds available in these situations, GLPI could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell assets at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions to make distributions sufficient to enable GLPI to pay out enough of its taxable income to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. These alternatives could increase GLPI's costs or reduce its equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder GLPI's ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of GLPI stock. Restrictions in GLPI's indebtedness following the Spin-Off, including restrictions on GLPI's ability to incur additional indebtedness or make certain distributions, could preclude it from meeting the 90% distribution requirement. Decreases in funds from operations due to unfinanced expenditures for acquisitions of properties or increases in the number of shares of GLPI common stock outstanding without commensurate increases in funds from operations each would adversely affect the ability of GLPI to maintain distributions to its shareholders. Moreover, the failure of Penn to make rental payments under the Penn Master Lease would materially impair the ability of GLPI to make distributions. Consequently, there can be no assurance that GLPI will be able to make distributions at the anticipated distribution rate or any other rate.\nEven if GLPI remains qualified as a REIT, GLPI may face other tax liabilities that reduce its cash flow.\nEven if GLPI remains qualified for taxation as a REIT, GLPI may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state, and local taxes on its income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state or local income, property and transfer taxes. For example, GLPI holds certain of its assets and conducts related activities through TRS subsidiary corporations that are subject to federal, state, and local corporate-level income taxes as regular C corporations as well as state and local gaming taxes. In addition, GLPI may incur a 100% excise tax on transactions with a TRS if they are not conducted on an arm's-length basis. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to GLPI shareholders.\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause GLPI to forego otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nTo qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, GLPI must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of its assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and \"real estate assets\" (as defined in the Code), including certain mortgage loans and securities. The remainder of GLPI's investments (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of GLPI's total assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a TRS) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20% of the value of GLPI's total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If GLPI fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, it must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, GLPI may be required to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments. These actions could have the effect of reducing GLPI's income and amounts available for distribution to GLPI shareholders.\nIn addition to the asset tests set forth above, to qualify to be taxed as a REIT GLPI must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of its income, the amounts it distributes to GLPI shareholders and the ownership of GLPI stock. GLPI may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to GLPI in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a REIT. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder GLPI's ability to make certain attractive investments.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit GLPI's ability to hedge effectively and may cause GLPI to incur tax liabilities.\nThe REIT provisions of the Code substantially limit GLPI's ability to hedge its assets and liabilities. Income from certain hedging transactions that GLPI may enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or from transactions to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that satisfy the REIT gross income tests (including gain from the termination of such a transaction) does not constitute \"gross income\" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests that apply to REITs, provided that certain identification requirements are met. To the extent that GLPI enters into other types of hedging transactions or fails to properly identify such transaction as a hedge, the income is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, GLPI may be required to limit its use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of GLPI's hedging activities because the TRS may be subject to tax on gains or expose GLPI to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates that GLPI would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in the TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit, except that such losses could theoretically be carried back or forward against past or future taxable income in the TRS.\nGLPI paid the Purging Distribution in common stock and cash and may pay taxable dividends on GLPI common stock in common stock and cash. GLPI's shareholders may sell shares of GLPI common stock to pay tax on such dividends, placing downward pressure on the market price of GLPI common stock.\nGLPI paid the Purging Distribution in a combination of cash and GLPI stock. Penn has received a private letter ruling from the IRS with respect to certain issues relevant to GLPI's payment of the Purging Distribution in a combination of cash and GLPI stock. In general, the ruling provides, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, that (1) the Purging Distribution will be treated as a dividend that will first reduce GLPI's accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) attributable to pre-REIT years in satisfaction of the REIT annual distribution requirement and (2) the amount of any GLPI stock received by any GLPI shareholder as part of the Purging Distribution will be considered to equal the amount of cash that could have been received instead. In the Purging Distribution, a shareholder of GLPI common stock will be required to report dividend income as a result of the Purging Distribution even though GLPI distributed no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such shareholder.\nGLPI currently intends to pay dividends (other than the Purging Distribution) in cash only, and not in-kind. However, if for any taxable year, GLPI has significant amounts of taxable income in excess of available cash flow, GLPI may declare dividends in-kind in order to satisfy the REIT annual distribution requirements. GLPI may distribute a portion of its dividends in the form of its stock or its debt instruments. In either event, a shareholder of GLPI common stock will be required to report dividend income as a result of such distributions even though GLPI distributed no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such shareholder.\nThe IRS has issued private letter rulings to other REITs (and, with respect to the Purging Distribution and as described above, to Penn) treating certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in stock as taxable dividends that would satisfy the REIT annual distribution requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Those rulings may be relied upon only by taxpayers to whom they were issued, but GLPI could request a similar ruling from the IRS. GLPI cannot rely on the private letter ruling Penn received from the IRS, as described above, with respect to the payment of dividends other than the Purging Distribution. In addition, the IRS previously issued a revenue procedure authorizing publicly traded REITs to make elective cash/stock dividends, but that revenue procedure does not apply to GLPI's taxable year beginning on January 1, 2014 and future taxable years. Accordingly, it is unclear whether and to what extent GLPI will be able to make taxable dividends (other than the Purging Distribution) payable in-kind.\nIf GLPI makes any taxable dividend payable in cash and common stock, taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of GLPI's current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, shareholders may be required to pay income tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the GLPI stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of the stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. shareholders, GLPI may be required to withhold federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in GLPI stock. If, in any taxable dividend payable in cash and GLPI stock, a significant number of GLPI shareholders determine to sell shares of GLPI stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may be viewed as economically equivalent to a dividend reduction and put downward pressure on the market price of GLPI stock.\nGLPI could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held before electing to be treated as a REIT.\nGLPI owns appreciated assets that were held by a C corporation before GLPI elected to be treated as a REIT and were acquired by GLPI in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in GLPI's ownership is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the C corporation. If GLPI disposes of any such appreciated assets during the five-year period following GLPI's acquisition of the assets from the C corporation (i.e., during the five-year period following GLPI's qualification as a REIT), GLPI will be subject to tax at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain from such assets to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the assets on the date that they were acquired by GLPI (i.e., at the time that GLPI became a REIT) over the adjusted tax basis of such assets on such date, which are referred to as built-in gains. GLPI would be subject to this tax liability even if it continues to qualify and maintains its status as a REIT. Any recognized built-in gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining REIT taxable income and GLPI's distribution requirement. Any tax on the recognized built-in gain will reduce REIT taxable income. GLPI may choose not to sell in a taxable transaction appreciated assets it might otherwise sell during the five-year period in which the built-in gain tax applies in order to avoid the built-in gain tax. However, there can be no assurances that such a taxable transaction will not occur. If GLPI sells such assets in a taxable transaction, the amount of corporate tax that GLPI will pay will vary depending on the actual amount of net built-in gain or loss present in those assets as of the time GLPI became a REIT. The amount of tax could be significant.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had indebtedness of $2.54 billion, with an additional $509.1 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future to refinance our existing indebtedness or to finance newly-acquired properties, such as the proposed Pinnacle transaction. Any significant additional indebtedness could require a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness. Greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, or carry out other aspects of our business strategy. Increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels and/or borrowing costs. Increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to acquire properties, finance or refinance our properties, contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time (if any). Among other things, the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade could increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources. If financing is not available when needed, or is available on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to develop new or enhance our existing properties, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to incur more indebtedness in connection with the Pinnacle transaction.\nOur expected increase in indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\na material portion of our cash flows will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, including indebtedness it may incur in the future, and will not be available for other purposes, including to pay dividends and make acquisitions;\n\u2022\nit could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged;\n\u2022\nit could make us more vulnerable to downturns in general economic or industry conditions or in our business, or prevent us from carrying out activities that are important to our growth;\n\u2022\nit could increase our interest expense if interest rates in general increase because our indebtedness under the senior unsecured credit facility bears interest at floating rates;\n\u2022\nit could limit our ability to take advantage of strategic business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nit could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including under the notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including any financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes or under the agreements governing our other indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility and under the notes.\nGLPI cannot assure you that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to GLPI under its senior unsecured credit facility or from other debt financing, in an amount sufficient to enable GLPI to pay its indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund its other liquidity needs. If GLPI does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt service obligations, including payments on the notes, GLPI may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring its indebtedness, selling assets or seeking to raise additional capital, including by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities. GLPI\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and its financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of GLPI\u2019s indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require GLPI to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict its business operations. GLPI\u2019s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt service requirements, including the inability to service the notes, or to refinance its obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on its business, financial position and results of operations, as well as on GLPI\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations in respect of the notes. To the extent that GLPI will incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with GLPI\u2019s leverage, including its possible inability to service its debt, would increase.\nWe may be subject to significant dilution caused by the additional issuance of equity securities.\nIf and when additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, including those expected to be raised in connection with the Pinnacle acquisition, our shareholders may experience significant dilution. Additionally, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, may make it more difficult for our shareholders to sell their GLPI common stock at a time and price that they deem appropriate and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities.\nAdverse changes in our credit rating may affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.\nOur outstanding debt is periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The credit ratings are based upon our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to both our industry and the economic outlook. Our credit rating may affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain. Because we rely in part on debt financing to fund growth, adverse changes in our credit rating may have a negative effect on our future growth.\nIf we cannot obtain additional capital, our growth may be limited.\nAs described above, in order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT each year, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our shareholders. As a result, our retained earnings available to fund acquisitions, development, or other capital expenditures are nominal, and we rely upon the availability of additional debt or equity capital to fund these activities. Our long-term ability to grow through acquisitions or development, which is an important component of our strategy, will be limited if we cannot obtain additional debt financing or raise equity capital. Market conditions may make it difficult to obtain debt financing or raise equity capital, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain such capital on favorable terms.\nAn increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on existing and future debt and could adversely affect our stock price.\nIf interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt and our variable rate debt obligations. This increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition more costly, as well as lower our current period earnings. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the access third parties have to credit, thereby decreasing the amount they are willing to pay for our assets and consequently limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nFurther, the dividend yield on our common stock, as a percentage of the price of such common stock, will influence the price of such common stock. Thus, an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend yield, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCovenants in our debt agreements may limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach or default could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain customary covenants, including restrictions on our ability to grant liens on our assets, incur indebtedness, sell assets, make investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments. We have to comply with the following financial covenants: a maximum total debt to total asset value ratio of 60% (subject to increase to 65% for specified periods in connection with certain acquisitions), a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2 to 1, a maximum senior secured debt to total asset value ratio of 40% and a maximum unsecured debt to unencumbered asset value ratio of 60%. These restrictions may limit our operational flexibility. Covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Spin-Off from Penn\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nAs a publicly traded company independent from Penn, GLPI has had the ability to pursue transactions with other gaming operators that would not pursue transactions with Penn as a current competitor and will have the ability to fund acquisitions with its equity on significantly more favorable terms than those that would be available to Penn, to diversify into different businesses in which Penn, as a practical matter, could not diversify, such as hotels, entertainment facilities and office space, and to pursue certain transactions that Penn otherwise would be disadvantaged by or precluded from pursuing due to regulatory constraints. However, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a company independent from Penn in the time we expect, if at all.\nIf the Spin-Off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, GLPI could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, GLPI could be required to indemnify Penn for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement.\nPenn has received a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Spin-Off, together with the required compliance exchanges and certain related transactions, will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and/or 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code (the \"IRS Ruling\"). The IRS Ruling does not address certain requirements for tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off under Section 355, and Penn received from its tax advisors a tax opinion substantially to the effect that, with respect to such requirements on which the IRS will not rule, such requirements have been satisfied. The IRS Ruling, and the tax opinions that Penn received from its tax advisors, relied on, among other things, certain representations, assumptions and undertakings, including those relating to the past and future conduct of GLPI's business, and the IRS Ruling and the opinions would not be valid if such representations, assumptions and undertakings were incorrect in any material respect.\nNotwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the tax opinions, the IRS could determine the Spin-Off should be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the IRS Ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the IRS Ruling.\nUnder a Tax Matters Agreement that GLPI entered into with Penn, GLPI generally is required to indemnify Penn against any tax resulting from the Spin-Off to the extent that such tax resulted from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of GLPI, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) other actions or failures to act by GLPI, or (iii) any of GLPI's representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated. GLPI's indemnification obligations to Penn and its subsidiaries, officers and directors will not be limited by any maximum amount. If GLPI is required to indemnify Penn or such other persons under the circumstance set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, GLPI may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nThe historical financial information included in this filing may not be a reliable indicator of future results.\nThe historical financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included herein reflect a full year of operations for the real estate entity and the businesses in the TRS, whereas financial results for the year ended December 31, 2013 reflect a full year of operations for the businesses in the TRS and a partial year from November 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013 for the real estate entity. The financial results for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 included in Item 6 reflect\nonly the operations of the TRS Properties. The historical financial statements included herein do not reflect what the business, financial position or results of operations of GLPI may be in the future.\nThe ownership by our executive officers and directors of common shares, options or other equity awards of Penn may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest.\nBecause of their current or former positions with Penn, substantially all of our executive officers, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and certain directors own common shares of Penn, options to purchase common shares of Penn or other Penn equity awards as well as common shares, options to purchase common shares and/or other equity awards in GLPI. The individual holdings of common shares, options to purchase common shares or other equity awards of Penn and GLPI may be significant for some of these persons compared to their total assets. These equity interests may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could benefit or affect the equity holders of Penn in ways that do not benefit or affect us in the same manner.\nPeter M. Carlino, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and David A. Handler, one of our independent directors, also serve on the Penn Board of Directors which may create conflicts of interest and/or create regulatory obstacles for the Company in its pursuit of additional properties.\nPeter M. Carlino serves as Chairman of Penn and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GLPI. In addition, David A. Handler, one of our directors, serves as a director at Penn. These overlapping positions could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or Penn's management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities, such as greenfield development opportunities, or face decisions that could have different implications for us and Penn. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the negotiation or the resolution of any dispute between us and Penn (or its subsidiaries) regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship (e.g. Penn Master Lease) thereafter. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and Penn enter into any commercial arrangements with each other in the future. We have established a mechanism in our Corporate Governance Guidelines to address potential conflicts through the use of an independent director but there can be no assurance that this process will completely eliminate conflicts resulting from overlapping directors. In addition to potential conflicts of interest, the overlapping director position could create obstacles to engaging in certain transactions in close proximity to existing Penn properties and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to overcome such obstacles.\nPotential indemnification liabilities of GLPI pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement could materially adversely affect GLPI.\nThe Separation and Distribution Agreement between GLPI and Penn provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation, certain conditions to the separation and provisions governing the relationship between GLPI and Penn with respect to, and resulting from the separation.\nAmong other things, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make GLPI financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may result relating to or arising out of its business. If GLPI is required to indemnify Penn under the circumstances set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, GLPI may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, Penn will indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that these indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Penn's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Penn has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Penn agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that Penn will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Penn any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from Penn and such recovery could have a material adverse impact on Penn's financial condition and ability to pay rent due under the Penn Master Lease.\nA court could deem the distribution to be a fraudulent conveyance and void the transaction or impose substantial liabilities upon us.\nA court could deem the distribution of GLPI common shares or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by Penn in connection with the Spin-Off, or the Purging Distribution by GLPI, to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as\nthey become due. In such circumstances, a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. Among other things, the court could require our shareholders to return to Penn some or all of the shares of our common stock issued in the distribution, to return some of the Purging Distribution to GLPI, or require us to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the restructuring transactions for the benefit of creditors. Whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied.\nThe Spin-Off agreements are not the result of negotiations between unrelated third parties.\nThe agreements that we entered into with Penn in connection with the Spin-Off, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Penn Master Lease, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement, were negotiated in the context of the Spin-Off while we were still a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were negotiated, we did not have an independent board of directors or a management team independent of Penn. As a result, although those agreements are generally intended to reflect arm's-length terms, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm's-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the terms of these agreements will be as favorable for GLPI as would have resulted from negotiations with one or more unrelated third parties.", "PERMNO": 14252, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "GLPI"}
