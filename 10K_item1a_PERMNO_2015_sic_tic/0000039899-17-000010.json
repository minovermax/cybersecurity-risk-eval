RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties and investors should consider carefully the following risk factors before investing in our securities. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.\nChanges in economic conditions in the U.S. markets we serve may depress demand for our products and services\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues in our Media Segment from the sale of advertising at our television stations. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. As a result, our operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy in our principal television and digital markets as well as the strength or weakness of regional and national economic factors. A decline in economic conditions in the U.S. could have a significant adverse impact on our businesses and could significantly impact all key advertising revenue categories. In addition, declining economic conditions could adversely affect employment conditions and consumer sentiment, reducing demand for the product offerings of CareerBuilder and Cars.com, which could impair our ability to maximize the value to our shareholders of these assets or to grow our Digital revenues.\nCompetition from alternative forms of media may impair our ability to grow or maintain revenue levels in core and new businesses\nAdvertising produces the majority of our revenues from our Media Segment, with our stations\u2019 affiliated desktop, mobile and tablet advertising revenues being an important component. Technology, particularly new video formats, streaming and downloading capabilities via the Internet, video-on-demand, personal video recorders and other devices and\ntechnologies used in the entertainment industry continues to evolve rapidly, leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content. These technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news and entertainment, including through so-called \u201ccutting the cord\u201d and other consumption strategies. These innovations may affect our ability to generate television audience, which may make our television stations less attractive to both household audiences and advertisers. This competition may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our Media Segment revenues.\nOur Media Segment is dependent on advertising revenues, which, in turn, depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control\nIn fiscal year 2016, 69% of our Media Segment\u2019s revenues were derived from television spot and digital advertising. Demand for advertising is highly dependent upon the strength of the U.S. economy, both in the markets our stations serve and in the nation as a whole. During an economic downturn, demand for advertising may decrease. Our Media Segment\u2019s advertising revenues can also vary substantially from year to year, driven by the political election cycle (e.g., even years); the ability and willingness of candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds on television and digital advertising, and the competitive nature of the elections impacting viewers within our stations\u2019 markets.\nIn addition, shifting viewer preferences could cause our advertising revenues to decline as a result of changes to the ratings of our programming, which may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nThe value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber attack\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, broadcasting disruptions, and loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results to be impacted.\nFurthermore, attempts to compromise information technology systems occur regularly across many industries and sectors, and we may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control. We invest in security resources and technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber-attack, but the techniques used to attempt attacks are constantly changing. A breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may be insufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nAs has historically been the case in the broadcast sector, loss of or changes in affiliation agreements or retransmission consent agreements could adversely affect operating results for our Media Segment\u2019s stations\nMost of our stations have network affiliation agreements with the major broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox). These television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations\u2019 commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during the programming. In most cases, we also make cash payments to the networks.\nEach of our affiliation agreements has a stated expiration date. If renewed, our network affiliation agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and/or which may not be as attractive to our audiences, resulting in reduced revenues.\nIn recent years, the networks have streamed their programming on the Internet and other distribution platforms, in some cases within a short period of the original network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own. An increase in the availability of network programming on alternative platforms that either bypass or provide less favorable terms to local stations - such as cable channels, the Internet and other distribution vehicles - may dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations.\nOur retransmission consent agreements with major cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers permit them to retransmit our stations\u2019 signals to their subscribers in exchange for the payment of compensation to us. As is the case in the broadcast television industry generally, if we are unable to renegotiate these agreements on favorable terms, or at all, the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe proposed separation of our Cars.com business unit from our Digital businesses is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all.\nOn September 7, 2016, we announced our intention to spin-off our Cars.com business unit within our Digital Segment. The separation, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017, is subject to final approval of our Board of Directors. In addition, unanticipated developments, regulatory approvals or clearances and uncertainty in the financial markets, could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different from those currently anticipated. As a result, we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the proposed separation on the terms or the timeline that we announced, if at all.\nThe proposed Cars.com separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits\nExecuting the proposed separation of Cars.com will require us to incur costs as well as time and attention from our senior management and key employees, which could distract them from operating our business, disrupt operations, and result in the loss of business opportunities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating key employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion, which could harm our business. Even if the proposed separation is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation and the separation may in fact adversely affect our business. As independent, publicly traded companies, both TEGNA and Cars.com will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions and competitive pressures, which could materially and adversely affect their respective businesses, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies following the completion of the proposed separation will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.\nThe strategic review of CareerBuilder business unit is subject to various risks and uncertainties\nOn September 7, 2016, we also announced that we will conduct a strategic review of our CareerBuilder business unit within our Digital Segment, including a possible sale. There can be no assurance of the terms, timing or structure of any transaction involving such business, or whether any such transaction will take place at all, and any such transaction is subject to risks and uncertainties.\nThere could be significant liability if the spin-off of the publishing businesses is determined to be a taxable transaction\nIn June 2015, we spun off our former publishing businesses, Gannett Co. Inc. (Gannett). In connection with the Gannett spin-off, we received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code were satisfied. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from TEGNA and Gannett regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, TEGNA and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nNotwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service could determine on audit that the Gannett separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of TEGNA or Gannett after the separation. If the Gannett separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, TEGNA and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nVolatility in the U.S. credit markets could significantly impact our ability to obtain new financing to fund our operations and strategic initiatives or to refinance our existing debt at reasonable rates and terms as it matures\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $4.08 billion in debt and approximately $844 million of undrawn additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility that expires in 2020. This debt matures at various times during the years 2017-2027. While our cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay amounts when due, if operating results deteriorate significantly, a portion of these maturities may need to be refinanced. Access to the capital markets for longer-term financing is unpredictable and volatile credit markets could make it harder for us to obtain debt financings generally.\nChanges in the regulatory environment could encumber or impede our efforts to improve operating results or the value of assets\nOur media and digital operations are subject to government regulation. Changing regulations, particularly FCC regulations which affect our television stations, may impair or reduce our leverage in negotiating affiliation or retransmission agreements, adversely affecting our revenues, or result in increased costs, reduced valuations for certain broadcasting properties or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability. All of our television stations are required to hold television broadcasting licenses from the FCC; when granted, these licenses are generally granted for a period of eight years. Under certain circumstances, the FCC is not required to renew any license and could decline to renew future license applications.\nThe value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating results\nGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $7.08 billion at December 31, 2016, representing approximately 83% of our total assets. These assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstance that indicate all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable in which case a non-cash charge to earnings may be necessary, as occurred in 2014-2016 (see Notes 4 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements). We may subsequently experience market pressures which could cause future cash flows to decline below our current expectations, or volatile equity markets could negatively impact market factors used in the impairment analysis, including earnings multiples, discount rates, and long-term growth rates. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity, although such charges would not affect our cash flow.\nOur strategic acquisitions, investments and partnerships could pose various risks, increase our leverage and may significantly impact our ability to expand our overall profitability\nAcquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow and could strain our human resources. We may be unable to successfully implement effective cost controls, achieve\nexpected synergies or increase revenues as a result of an acquisition. Acquisitions may result in us assuming unexpected liabilities and in management diverting its attention from the operation of our business. Acquisitions may result in us having greater exposure to the industry risks of the businesses underlying the acquisition. Strategic investments and partnerships with other companies expose us to the risk that we may be unable to control the operations of our investee or partnership, which could decrease the amount of benefits we realize from a particular relationship. We are exposed to the risk that our partners in strategic investments and infrastructure may encounter financial difficulties which could disrupt investee or partnership activities, or impair assets acquired, which would adversely affect future reported results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity. The failure to obtain regulatory approvals may prevent us from completing or realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. Furthermore, acquisitions may subject us to new or different regulations which could have an adverse effect on our operations.", "PERMNO": 47941, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "TGNA"}
