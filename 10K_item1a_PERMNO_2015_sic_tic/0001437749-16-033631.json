{"cik": "69733", "company": "NATHANS FAMOUS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-06-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business is subject to various risks. Certain risks are specific to each way we do business, such as through Company-owned restaurants, franchised restaurants, branded products and retail, while other risks, such as health-related or economic risks, may affect all of the ways that we do business.\nInvestors should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Form 10-K, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of the Company\u2019s securities. The following risk factors are not exhaustive. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company may also adversely impact its business. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. In that case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company\u2019s results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks it faces described below and elsewhere. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above.\nOur Agreement with John Morrell & Co. has resulted in a significant increase in our royalties compared to the royalties we received in prior years and there can be no assurance that such increases will continue in the future.\nWe earned license royalties of approximately $16,586,000 in fiscal 2016 as compared to license royalties of $14,367,000 in fiscal 2015. The amount of license royalties we received in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 constitute a significant increase in the amount of royalties we received compared to earlier periods. This increase is primarily due to our agreement with John Morrell as compared to the licensing revenues we received from our predecessor licensee, SMG. There can be no assurance that we will continue to derive the same increase in our license royalties in the future or that our future license royalties will be similar to our fiscal 2016 license royalties.\nIf (i) our license revenues decrease or increase only by a nominal amount in future years or (ii) we fail to achieve cost savings as a result of the John Morrell agreement, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant amount of our licensing and BPP revenue is from a small number of licensees and BPP accounts. The loss of any one or more of those licensees or Branded BPP accounts could harm our profitability and operating results.\nJohn Morrell accounted for approximately 95.0% and 93.9% of our licensing revenue for the fiscal 2016 period and fiscal 2015 period, respectively. John Morrell\u2019s business is weighted towards one high volume user who is not sold pursuant to a formal agreement. As a result of the John Morrell Agreement, we expect that most of our license royalties will be earned from John Morrell for the foreseeable future. While our agreement with John Morrell expires in 2032, in the event that, (i) this licensee or any other significant licensee, or its customers, experience financial difficulties, (ii) there is a disruption or termination of this agreement or (iii) there is a significant decrease in our revenue from John Morrell, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, for the fiscal 2016 period, approximately 74% of our BPP business is from seven accounts, including one account representing approximately 24% of the BPP business, with which we have relatively short-term contracts. In the event that these BPP customers experience financial difficulties or, upon the expiration of their existing agreements are not willing to do business with us in the future on terms acceptable to management, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur increase in Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily results from a decrease in expenses.\nWhile our Adjusted EBITDA increased from $22.5 million in fiscal 2015 to $27.2 million in fiscal 2016, such increase was primarily the result of a decrease in total costs and expenses (primarily beef costs) from $79.2 million in fiscal 2015 to $75.9 million in fiscal 2016. Our expenses are and will be impacted by commodity costs and other factors beyond our control, such as recently enacted increases in the minimum wage. Any significant increase in the cost of beef and our other expenses without a corresponding increase in revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in the cost of food and paper products could harm our profitability and operating results.\nThe cost of the food and paper products we use depends on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Food and paper products typically represent approximately 25% to 30% of our cost of restaurant sales. We purchase large quantities of beef and our beef costs in the United States represent approximately 80% to 90% of our food costs. The market for beef is particularly volatile and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions such as the 2012 drought in the Midwest, industry demand and other factors beyond our control. For example, in the past, reduced supply and increased demand in beef resulted in shortages, which required us to pay significantly higher prices for the beef we purchased. After multi-year increases, beginning March 2015, the beef markets stabilized through June 2015 before subsequently declining by as much as 30%. As a result of the decline since June 2015, the market price of hot dogs during the fiscal 2016 period was approximately 11.6% lower than the fiscal 2015 period. The market price of hot dogs during the fiscal 2015 period was approximately 17.1% higher than the fiscal 2014 period. As the price of beef or other food products that we use in our operations increases significantly, particularly in the BPP, and we choose not to pass, or cannot pass, these increases on to our customers, our operating margins will decrease.\nFluctuations in weather, supply and demand and economic conditions could adversely affect the cost, availability and quality of some of our critical products, including beef. Our inability to obtain requisite quantities of high-quality ingredients would adversely affect our ability to provide the menu items that are central to our business, and the highly competitive nature of our industry may limit our ability to pass through increased costs to our customers. Continuing increases in the cost of fuel would increase the distribution costs of our prime products thereby increasing the food and paper cost to us and to our franchisees, thus negatively affecting profitability.\nWe have sought to lock in the cost of a portion of our beef purchases by entering into various commitments to purchase hot dogs during certain periods in an effort to ensure supply of product at a fixed cost of product. However, we may be unable to enter into similar purchase commitments in the future. In addition, we do not have the ability to effectively hedge all of our beef purchases using futures or forward contracts without incurring undue financial cost and risk.\nJohn Morrell currently has three manufacturing facilities producing different Nathan\u2019s products and a long-term significant interruption of a primary facility could potentially disrupt our operations.\nJohn Morrell currently has three manufacturing facilities producing different Nathan\u2019s products. A temporary closure of any of the three plants could potentially cause a temporary disruption to our source of supply, potentially causing some or all of certain shipments to customers to be delayed. A longer-term significant interruption at any of these production facilities, whether as a result of a natural disaster or other causes, could significantly impair our ability to operate our business on a day-to-day basis while John Morrell determines how to make up for any lost production capabilities, during which time we may not be able to secure sufficient alternative sources of supply on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, a long-term disruption in supply to our customers could cause our customers to determine not to purchase some or all of their hot dogs from us in the future, which in turn would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a supply disruption might affect our brand in the eyes of consumers and the retail trade, which damage might negatively impact our overall business in general, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe loss of one or more of our key suppliers could lead to supply disruptions, increased costs and lower operating results.\nWe have historically relied on one supplier for the majority of our hot dogs and another supplier for a majority of our supply of frozen French fries for our restaurant system. An interruption in the supply of product from either of these suppliers without our obtaining an alternative source of supply on comparable terms could lead to supply disruptions, increased costs and lower operating results.\nDuring fiscal 2013, we entered into a new agreement with a secondary hot dog manufacturer that continues to also supply natural casing hot dogs for our restaurant business.\nAdditionally, a majority of the frozen crinkle-cut French fries sold through our franchised restaurants have been obtained from one supplier. Beginning in fiscal 2013, we began a relationship with a secondary source of supply of our frozen French fries for our restaurant system. During the fiscal years ended March 27, 2016 and March 29, 2015, McCain Foods USA supplied approximately 15.6% and 13.5%, respectively, of the frozen crinkle-cut French fries sold through our franchised restaurants.\nIn the event that the hot dog or French fry suppliers are unable to fulfill our requirements for any reason, including due to a significant interruption in its manufacturing operations, whether as a result of a natural disaster or for other reasons, such interruption could significantly impair our ability to operate our business on a day-to-day basis.\nIn the event that we are unable to find one or more alternative suppliers of hot dogs or French fries on a timely basis, there could be a disruption in the supply of product to Company-owned restaurants, franchised restaurants and BPP accounts, which would damage our business, our franchisees and our BPP customers and, in turn, negatively impact our financial results. In addition, any gap in supply to retail customers would result in lost royalty payments to us, which could have a significant adverse financial impact on our results of operations. Furthermore, any gap in supply to retail customers may damage our brand in the eyes of consumers and the retail trade, which damage might negatively impact our overall business in general and impair our ability to continue our retail licensing program.\nAdditionally, there is no assurance that any supplemental sources of supply would be capable of meeting our specifications and quality standards on a timely and consistent basis or that the financial terms of such supply arrangement will be as favorable as our present terms with our hot dog or French fry supplier, as the case may be.\nAny of the foregoing occurrences may cause disruptions in supply of our hot dog or French fry products, as the case may be, damage our franchisees and our BPP customers, adversely impact our financial results and/or damage our brand.\nOur earnings and business growth strategy depends in large part on the success of our product licensees and product manufacturers. Our reputation and the reputation of our brand may be harmed by actions taken by our product licensees or product manufacturers that are otherwise outside of our control.\nA significant portion of our earnings has come from royalties paid by our product licensees such as SMG, John Morrell and ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston, Inc., Saratoga Food Specialties, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of John Morrell, and Perfection Foods. Although our agreements with these licensees contain numerous controls and safeguards, and we monitor the operations of our product licensees, our licensees are independent contractors, and their employees are not our employees. Accordingly, we cannot necessarily control the performance of our licensees under their license agreements, including without limitation, the licensee\u2019s continued best efforts to manufacture our products for retail distribution and our foodservice businesses, timely delivery of the licensed products, market the licensed products and assure the quality of the licensed products produced and/or sold by a product licensee. Any shortcoming in the quality, quantity and/or timely delivery of a licensed product is likely to be attributed by consumers to an entire brand\u2019s reputation, potentially adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a licensee\u2019s failure to effectively market the licensed products may result in decreased sales, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, to the extent that the terms and conditions of any of these license agreements change or we change any of our product licensees, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected.\nThe quick-service restaurant business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower revenues, margins and market share.\nThe quick-service restaurant business of the foodservice industry is intensely competitive regarding price, service, location, personnel and type and quality of food. We and our franchisees compete with international, national, regional and local retailers primarily through the quality, variety and value perception of food products offered. Other key competitive factors include the number and location of restaurants, quality and speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs, and new product development. We anticipate competition will continue to focus on pricing. Many of our competitors have substantially larger marketing budgets, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. Changes in pricing or other marketing strategies by these competitors can have an adverse impact on our sales, earnings and growth. For example, many of those competitors have adopted \u201cvalue pricing\u201d strategies intended to lure customers away from other companies, including our Company. Consequently, these strategies could have the effect of drawing customers away from companies which do not engage in discount pricing and could also negatively impact the operating margins of competitors which attempt to match their competitors\u2019 price reductions. Extensive price discounting in the quick-service restaurant business could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nIn addition, we and our franchisees compete within the foodservice market and the quick-service restaurant business not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees and qualified franchisees. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.\nNew York State recently passed legislation increasing the minimum hourly wage for fast food workers of restaurant chains with 30 or more locations nationwide.\nNew York State recently passed legislation increasing the minimum hourly wage for fast food workers of restaurant chains with 30 or more locations nationwide. The increases took effect beginning December 31, 2015 and will be fully phased in by December 31, 2018 in New York City, where we operate three Company-owned restaurants and by December 31, 2021 throughout the rest of New York State which would impact our two remaining Company-owned restaurants and our franchised restaurants that operate in New York State. As a result, we anticipate that our labor costs will increase. If we are unable to pass on these higher costs through price increases, our margins and profitability will be adversely impacted. Additionally, a decrease in profitability at our franchisee\u2019s restaurants, the potential loss of new franchisees or the closing of a significant number of existing franchised restaurants could significantly impact our business.\nLabor shortages or increases in labor costs could slow our growth or harm our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability and the ability of our franchisees to continue to attract, motivate and retain regional, operational and restaurant general managers with the qualifications to succeed in our industry and the motivation to apply our core service philosophy. If we or our franchisees are unable to continue to recruit and retain sufficiently qualified managers or to motivate our employees to achieve sustained high service levels, our business and our growth could be adversely affected. Competition for these employees could require the payment of higher wages that could result in higher labor costs.\nWe must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act and various federal and state laws governing minimum wages. Increases in the minimum wage or labor regulation could increase labor costs. The state of New York approved legislation which increased the minimum wage beginning December 31, 2013, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015. The impact of the New York minimum wage increases on our business amounted to 6.9% average salary increase in 2015 and approximately a 12.2% average increase in 2016 for our employees that are affected. In addition, voters in the state of New Jersey voted to increase the minimum wage in the 2013 general election, and the federal government and a number of other states are evaluating various proposals to increase their respective minimum wage. As minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. In addition, effective April 1, 2014, the City of New York passed legislation extending paid sick leave to all employees, including part-time employees which potentially will increase our labor costs in three of our Company-operated restaurants. We may not be able to anticipate and react to changing costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and prices to sufficiently account for increased wage costs. We may be unable to increase our prices in order to pass these increased labor costs on to our customers, in which case our margins and our franchisees\u2019 margins would be negatively affected. In the event that franchisees\u2019 margins are adversely affected, it may affect our ability to attract new franchisees which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in economic, market and other conditions could adversely affect us and our franchisees, and thereby our operating results.\nThe quick-service restaurant business is affected by changes in international, national, regional, and local economic conditions, consumer preferences and spending patterns, demographic trends, consumer perceptions of food safety, weather, traffic patterns, the type, number and location of competing restaurants, and the effects of war or terrorist activities and any governmental responses thereto. Factors such as inflation, higher costs for each of food, labor, benefits and utilities, the availability and cost of suitable sites, fluctuating insurance rates, state and local regulations and licensing requirements, legal claims, and the availability of an adequate number of qualified management and hourly employees also affect restaurant operations and administrative expenses. Our ability and our franchisees\u2019 ability to finance new restaurant development, improvements and additions to existing restaurants, and the acquisition of restaurants from, and sale of restaurants to, franchisees is affected by economic conditions, including interest rates and other government policies impacting land and construction costs and the cost and availability of borrowed funds.\nCurrent restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all, which may reduce our revenue.\nThe success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that current locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. If we and our franchisees cannot obtain desirable additional and alternative locations at reasonable prices, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAny perceived or real health risks related to the food industry could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nWe are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by the following:\n\u25cf\nfood spoilage or food contamination;\n\u25cf\nconsumer product liability claims;\n\u25cf\nproduct tampering; and\n\u25cf\nthe potential cost and disruption of a product recall.\nOur products are susceptible to contamination by disease-producing organisms, or pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, campylobacter, hepatitis A, trichinosis and generic E. coli. Because these pathogens are generally found in the environment, there is a risk that these pathogens could be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the manufacturing, processing, foodservice or consumer level. Our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities and products, as well as our franchisee and Company-operated restaurant operations, are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to health, food preparation, sanitation and safety standards. Difficulties or failures by these companies in obtaining any required licenses or approvals or otherwise complying with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our revenue that is generated from these companies. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that compliance with governmental regulations by our suppliers or in connection with restaurant operations will eliminate the risks related to food safety. In addition, our beef products are also subject to the risk of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy.\nEvents reported in the media, such as incidents involving food-borne illnesses or food tampering, whether or not accurate, can cause damage to our brand\u2019s reputation and affect sales and profitability. Reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as e-coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the quick-service restaurant business and could in the future affect our business as well. Our brand\u2019s reputation is an important asset to the business; as a result, anything that damages our brand\u2019s reputation could immediately and severely hurt systemwide sales and, accordingly, revenue and profits. If customers become ill from food-borne illnesses or food tampering, we could also be forced to temporarily close some, or all, restaurants. In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses or food tampering, even those occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors, could, by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry, adversely affect system sales on a local, regional or systemwide basis. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our Company-owned restaurants or our franchisees\u2019 restaurants, could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness, or death. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competitive reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Injury to our brand\u2019s reputation would likely reduce revenue and profits.\nNegative publicity, including complaints on social media platforms and other internet-based communications, could damage our reputation and harm our guest traffic, and in turn, negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThere has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices, including blogs, social media websites and other forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals to access a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Consumers value readily available information concerning goods and services that they have or plan to purchase, and may act on such information without further investigation or authentication. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate, as is its impact. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available. Information concerning our business and products may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Such platforms could also be used for dissemination of trade secret information, compromising valuable Company assets. In sum, the dissemination of information online, regardless of its accuracy, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.\nChanging health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid products offered by us in favor of alternative foods.\nThe foodservice industry is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions. Reports of the use of hormones, antibiotics or pesticides in the production of certain food products may cause consumers to reduce or avoid consumption of such food products. If prevailing health or dietary preferences, perceptions and governmental regulation cause consumers to avoid the products we offer in favor of alternative or healthier foods, demand for our products may be reduced and our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to health, employment, environmental and other government regulations, and failure to comply with existing or future government regulations could expose us to litigation, damage our corporate reputation or the reputation of our brands and lower profits.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules or regulations affecting our businesses. To the extent that the standards imposed by local, state and federal authorities are inconsistent, they can adversely affect popular perceptions of our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. We may be unable to manage effectively the impact of new, potential or changing regulations that affect or restrict elements of our business. The successful development and operation of restaurants depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use (including the placement of drive-thru windows), environmental (including litter), traffic and other regulations. There can be no assurance that we and our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future. Restaurant operations are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments relating to health, food preparation, sanitation and safety standards, federal and state labor laws (including applicable minimum wage requirements, overtime, working and safety conditions and citizenship requirements), federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. If we fail to comply with any of these laws, we may be subject to governmental action or litigation, and accordingly our reputation could be harmed.\nInjury to us or our brand\u2019s reputation would, in turn, likely reduce revenue and profits. In addition, difficulties or failures in obtaining any required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development or opening of a new restaurant or renovations to existing restaurants, which would adversely affect our revenue.\nIn recent years, there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry, particularly among quick-service restaurants. As a result, we may become subject to regulatory initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food products, which could increase expenses. The operation of our franchise system is also subject to franchise laws and regulations enacted by a number of states and rules promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Any future legislation regulating franchise relationships may negatively affect our operations, particularly our relationship with our franchisees. Failure to comply with new or existing franchise laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales. Changes in applicable accounting rules imposed by governmental regulators or private governing bodies could also affect our reported results of operations, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could decrease the value of our business or the value of our brands and products.\nThe success of our business depends on the continued ability to use existing trademarks, service marks and other components of each of our brands in order to increase brand awareness and further develop branded products. We may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks, and the use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition. All of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate.\nWe have registered or applied to register many of our trademarks and service marks both in the United States and in foreign countries. Because of the differences in foreign trademark laws, our trademark rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the United States. We also cannot assure you that our trademark and service mark applications will be approved. In addition, third parties may oppose our trademark and service mark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks or service marks. In the event that our trademarks or service marks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products and services, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our marks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks or service marks.\nWe also license third party franchisees and other licensees to use our trademarks and service marks. We enter into franchise agreements with our franchisees and license agreements with other licensees which govern the use of our trademarks and service marks. Although we make efforts to police the use of our trademarks and service marks by our franchisees and other licensees, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be sufficient to ensure that our franchisees and other licensees abide by the terms of the trademark licenses. In the event that our franchisees fail to do so, our trademark and service mark rights could be diluted.\nOur earnings and business growth strategy depends in large part on the success of our restaurant franchisees and on new restaurant openings. Our corporate reputation or brand reputation may be harmed by actions taken by restaurant franchisees that are otherwise outside of our control.\nA significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties, fees and other amounts paid by our restaurant franchisees. The opening and success of franchised restaurants depends on various factors, including the demand for our franchises and the selection of appropriate franchisee candidates, the availability of suitable restaurant sites, the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations, permitting and regulatory compliance, the ability to meet construction schedules, the availability of financing and the financial and other capabilities of our franchisees and area developers. We cannot assure you that area developers planning the opening of franchised restaurants will have the business abilities or sufficient access to financial resources necessary to open the restaurants required by their agreements. We cannot assure you that franchisees will successfully participate in our strategic initiatives or operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with our concept and standards. Our franchisees are independent contractors, and their employees are not our employees. We provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, our franchisees, but the quality of their restaurant operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Consequently, the franchisees may not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with our high standards and requirements, and franchisees may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel. Any operational shortcoming of a franchised restaurant is likely to be attributed by consumers to an entire brand or our system, thus damaging our corporate or brand reputation, potentially adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGrowth in our restaurant revenue and earnings is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings. Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings. These factors include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract new franchisees;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of site locations for new restaurants;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing, which has become more difficult due to current market conditions and operating results;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;\n\u25cf\nconstruction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and\n\u25cf\nadverse weather conditions.\nWe cannot assure you that franchisees will renew their franchise agreements or that franchised restaurants will remain open. Closings of franchised restaurants are expected in the ordinary course and may cause our royalty revenues and financial performance to decline. Our principal competitors may have greater influence over their respective restaurant systems than we do because of their significantly higher percentage of company restaurants and/or ownership of franchisee real estate and, as a result, may have a greater ability to implement operational initiatives and business strategies, including their marketing and advertising programs.\nAs our franchisees are independent operators, we have limited influence over their ability to invest in other businesses or incur excessive indebtedness. Some of our franchisees have invested in other businesses, including other restaurant concepts. Such franchisees may use the cash generated by their Nathan\u2019s restaurants to expand their other businesses or to subsidize losses incurred by such businesses. Additionally, as independent operators, franchisees do not require our consent to incur indebtedness. Consequently, our franchisees have in the past, and may in the future, experience financial distress as a result of over-leveraging. To the extent that our franchisees use the cash from their Nathan\u2019s restaurants to subsidize their other businesses or experience financial distress, due to over-leveraging, delayed or reduced payments of royalties, advertising fund contributions and rents for properties we lease to them, or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. In addition, lenders to our franchisees may be less likely to provide current or prospective franchisees necessary financing on favorable terms, or at all, due to current market conditions and operating results.\nChanges in franchise regulation laws could impact our ability to obtain or retain licenses or approvals and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are also subject to federal statutes and regulations, including the rules promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, as well as certain state laws governing the offer and sale of franchises. Many state franchise laws impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements, including limitations on non-competition provisions and on provisions concerning the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Some states require that certain materials be filed for a franchisor to be registered and approved, before franchises can be offered or sold in that state. The failure to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.\nWe rely on the performance of major retailers, wholesalers, specialty distributors and mass merchants for the success of our business, and should they perform poorly or give higher priority to other brands or products, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe sell our products to retail outlets and wholesale distributors including, traditional supermarkets, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, wholesalers, food service distributors and convenience stores. The replacement by or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or chains or our inability to collect accounts receivable from our customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our customers offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors. In the future, our customers may not continue to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels of promotional support.\nThe sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits.\nOur customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors, have continued to consolidate, resulting in fewer customers with which to do business. These consolidations and the growth of supercenters have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs, or specialty tailored products. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands. If the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength and/or increased private label or store brand competition, our profitability could decline.\nConsolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers\u2019 business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.\nFailure by third-party manufacturers or suppliers of raw materials to comply with food safety, environmental or other regulations may disrupt our supply of certain products and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our products and on other suppliers to supply raw materials. Such manufacturers and other suppliers, whether in the United States or outside the United States, are subject to a number of regulations, including food safety and environmental regulations. Failure by any of our manufacturers or other suppliers to comply with regulations, or allegations of compliance failure, may disrupt their operations. Disruption of the operations of a manufacturer or other suppliers could disrupt our supply of product or raw materials, which could have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Additionally, actions we may take to mitigate the impact of any such disruption or potential disruption, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption, may adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nLeasing of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.\nWe lease land and/or buildings for certain restaurants, which can include the sub-letting of leased land and/or buildings to franchisees or companies other than our franchisees. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning, leasing and sub-leasing real estate. We generally cannot cancel these leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform the obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations.\nWe may evaluate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives, any of which could distract management or otherwise have a negative effect on revenue, costs and stock price.\nOur future success may depend on opportunities to buy or obtain rights to other businesses that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer growth opportunities. In particular, we may evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint venture investments, strategic initiatives, alliances, vertical integration opportunities and divestitures. We have no commitments, agreements or understandings with respect to any of such transactions. In addition, our ability to engage in these transactions may be impacted by the incurrence of debt as a result of our sale of the Notes. Any attempt by us to engage in these transactions may expose us to various inherent risks, including:\n\u25cf\nnot accurately assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in successfully integrating, operating, maintaining and managing newly-acquired operations or employees;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility of impairment charges if an acquired business performs below expectations; and\n\u25cf\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from the existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or implement the strategic initiative.\nOur annual and quarterly financial results may fluctuate depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control, and, if we fail to meet the expectations of investors, our share price may decline.\nOur sales and operating results can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Certain events and factors may directly and immediately decrease demand for our products. These events and factors include:\n\u25cf\nchanges in customer demand;\n\u25cf\nvariations in the timing and volume of Nathan\u2019s sales and franchisees\u2019 sales;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the terms of our existing license/supply agreements and/or the replacement of existing licenses or suppliers;\n\u25cf\nsales promotions by Nathan\u2019s and its competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in average same-store sales and customer visits;\n\u25cf\nvariations in the price, availability and shipping costs of supplies;\n\u25cf\nseasonal effects on demand for Nathan\u2019s products;\n\u25cf\nunexpected slowdowns in new store development efforts;\n\u25cf\nchanges in competitive and economic conditions generally;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the cost or availability of ingredients or labor;\n\u25cf\nweather and acts of God; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in the number of franchises sold and in franchise agreement renewals.\nOur operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.\nWeather, which is unpredictable, can impact our sales. Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our Company-owned and our franchisees\u2019 restaurants. A heavy snowstorm or a tropical storm or hurricane in the Northeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area at Company-owned and franchised restaurants. For instance, Superstorm Sandy forced the temporary closing of all of our Company-owned restaurants. Our flagship Coney Island restaurant and our Boardwalk restaurant were closed for an extended period of time and re-opened on May 20, 2013 and March 18, 2013, respectively. In addition, 78 franchised restaurants including 18 BMP locations were closed for varying periods of time, one of which has not re-opened. Our fourth quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at Company-owned and franchised restaurants. Restaurant sales were significantly impacted due to the harsh winter weather experienced during the fourth quarters of the fiscal 2015 period and the fiscal 2014 period. Additionally, our Company-owned restaurants at Coney Island are heavily dependent on favorable weather conditions during the summer season. Rain during the weekends and/or unseasonably cold temperatures will negatively impact the number of patrons going to the Coney Island beach locations. Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins, and can result in restaurant operating losses. For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of our performance or how it may perform in the future.\nDue to the concentration of our restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.\nAs of March 27, 2016, we and our franchisees (including units operated pursuant to our BMP) operated Nathan\u2019s restaurants in 21 states and 11 foreign countries. As of March 27, 2016, the highest concentration of operating units was in the Northeast, principally in New York and New Jersey. This geographic concentration in the Northeast can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations. It is possible that adverse economic conditions in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Nathan\u2019s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.\nWe rely extensively on computer systems, its point of sales system and information technology to manage our business. Any disruption in our computer systems, point of sales system or information technology may adversely affect our ability to run our business.\nWe are significantly dependent upon our computer systems, point of sales system and information technology to properly conduct our business. A failure or interruption of computer systems, point of sales systems or information technology could result in the loss of data, business interruptions or delays in business operations. Further, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems, point of sales systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any security breach of our computer systems, point of sales systems or information technology may result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, penalties or loss resulting from misappropriation of information.\nWe may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.\nWe have long-lived assets, a cost-method investment, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment annually, or more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, such as:\n\u25cf\nsignificant adverse changes in the business climate;\n\u25cf\ncurrent period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets;\n\u25cf\noperating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with cost method investment;\n\u25cf\na current expectation that more-likely-than-not (e.g., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and\n\u25cf\na significant drop in our stock price.\nBased upon future economic and capital market conditions, future impairment charges could be incurred.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nUnforeseen events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, such as a continued interruption in the relationship between the United States and Russia, public health issues such as epidemics or pandemics, labor unrest and natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes or other extreme adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of franchisees, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. These events could negatively impact consumer spending, thereby reducing demand for our products, or the ability to receive products from suppliers. We do not have insurance policies that insure against certain of these risks. To the extent that we do maintain insurance with respect to some of these risks, our receipt of the proceeds of such policies may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.\nOur international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty.\nOur business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, differing cultures and consumer preferences, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements and the collection of royalties from international franchisees, the availability and cost of land and construction costs, and the availability of appropriate franchisees. In developing markets, we may face risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Although we believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable.\nOur business operations and future development could be significantly disrupted if we lose key members of our management team.\nThe success of our business continues to depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior officers and key employees, both individually and as a group. Our future performance will be substantially dependent, in particular, on our ability to retain and motivate our executive officers, for certain of whom we currently have employment agreements in place. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. If we lose the services of any of these individuals in the foreseeable future; we currently have no effective replacement for any of these individuals due to their experience, reputation in the industry and special role in our operations.\nA recent ruling and complaint filed by the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board could, if upheld, make us liable for violations of overtime, wage or union-organization violations by our franchisees.\nGeneral Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued a statement announcing that McDonald\u2019s Corp. might be charged with being jointly liable for labor and wage violations by its franchisees. Subsequently on December 19, 2014, the General Counsel issued complaints alleging that McDonald\u2019s Corp. was a \u201cjoint employer\u201d with its franchisees at certain franchised locations, under certain fact patterns. McDonald\u2019s Corp. and its franchisees are currently in administrative litigation with the NLRB. If the complaints are not dismissed and the NLRB prevails in the administrative proceedings (as well as in related appeals in federal courts that will ensue), and depending upon the facts charged in that case, the \u201cjoint employment\u201d principle may be extended more broadly to franchisors other than McDonald\u2019s Corp. (such as Nathan\u2019s). If that took place, then we might be held partly liable in cases of alleged overtime, wage, or union-organizing violations by our franchisees. Among other things, such an outcome may make it easier to organize our franchisees\u2019 staff into unions, provide the staff and their union representatives with bargaining power to request that we have our franchisees raise wages, and make it more expensive and less profitable to operate a Nathan\u2019s franchised restaurant. A decrease in profitability or the closing of a significant number of franchised restaurants could significantly impact our business (as well as our franchisees\u2019 businesses), and we may also be significantly impacted if the NLRB successfully brought an action against our company alleging that we are a \u201cjoint employer\u201d of our franchisees\u2019 staffs.\nWe face risks of litigation and pressure tactics, such as strikes, boycotts and negative publicity from customers, franchisees, suppliers, employees and others, which could divert our financial, and management resources and which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nClass action lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, against various quick-service restaurants alleging, among other things, that quick-service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with high-fat foods and that quick-service restaurant marketing practices have targeted children and encouraged obesity. In addition, we face the risk of lawsuits and negative publicity resulting from injuries, including injuries to infants and children, allegedly caused by our products, toys and other promotional items available in our restaurants or by our playground equipment.\nIn addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources, adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and brand reputation, hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees, expand our BPP and otherwise grow our business in the United States and internationally.\nIn addition, activist groups, including animal rights activists and groups acting on behalf of franchisees, the workers who work for suppliers and others, have in the past, and may in the future, use pressure tactics to generate adverse publicity by alleging, for example, inhumane treatment of animals by our suppliers, poor working conditions or unfair purchasing policies. These groups may be able to coordinate their actions with other groups, threaten strikes or boycotts or enlist the support of well-known persons or organizations in order to increase the pressure on us to achieve their stated aims. In the future, these actions or the threat of these actions may force us to change our business practices or pricing policies, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, we may be subject to employee, franchisee and other claims in the future based on, among other things, mismanagement of the system, unfair or unequal treatment, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage, rest break and meal break issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We have been subject to these types of claims in the past, and if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nGeneral regulation of the restaurant industry could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements. In recent years, there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry, particularly among restaurants. This focus has resulted in, and may continue to result in, the enactment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu offerings. For example, a number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information available to customers, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. Furthermore, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) establishes a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants to post nutritional information on their menus. Specifically, the PPACA amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to require chain restaurants with 20 or more locations operating under the same name and offering substantially the same menus to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus and menu boards, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. The PPACA also requires covered restaurants to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information for each standard menu item, and to provide a statement on menus and menu boards about the availability of this information.\nThe PPACA further permits the United States Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) to require covered restaurants to make additional nutrient disclosures, such as disclosure of trans fat content. On November 25, 2014, the FDA announced its final rules for nationwide nutritional labeling on menus of establishments with at least 20 locations, as well as food trucks, vending machines, movie theaters, pizza parlors, amusement parks, grocery stores and anywhere else where ready-to-eat meals are sold. The nutritional labeling rules require establishments to post calorie counts on all menu items, calorie boards and drive-thru displays throughout the United States. Businesses affected by the new regulations have one year to comply. Compliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items may be costly and time-consuming.\nAn unfavorable report on, or reaction to, our menu ingredients, the size of our portions or the nutritional content of our menu items could negatively influence the demand for our offerings. Additionally, if consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. Additionally, some government authorities are increasing regulations regarding trans fats and sodium, which may require us to limit or eliminate trans fats and sodium from our menu offerings, switch to higher cost ingredients or may hinder our ability to operate in certain markets. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. The imposition of menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as the restaurant industry in general.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws and other corporate documents include anti-takeover provisions which may deter or prevent a takeover attempt.\nSome provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, other corporate documents and provisions of Delaware law may discourage takeover attempts and hinder a merger, tender offer or proxy contest targeting us, including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares. This may limit the ability of stockholders to approve a transaction that they may think is in their best interest. The corporate documents include:\n\u25cf\nShareholder Rights Agreement. We adopted a new rights agreement which provided for a dividend distribution of one right for each share to holders of record of common stock on June 17, 2013. The rights become exercisable in the event any person or group accumulates 15% or more of our common stock, or if any person or group announces an offer which would result in it owning 15% or more of our common stock and our management does not approve of the proposed ownership.\n\u25cf\nEmployment Contracts. The employment agreements between us and each of Howard M. Lorber and Eric Gatoff provide that in the event there is a change in control of Nathan\u2019s, the employee has the option, exercisable within one year for each of Messrs. Lorber and Gatoff, of his becoming aware of the change in control, to terminate his employment agreement. Upon such termination, Mr. Gatoff has the right to receive a lump sum payment equal to his salary and annual bonus for a one-year period, and Mr. Lorber has the right to receive a lump sum payment equal to the greater of (i) his salary and annual bonuses for the remainder of the employment term or (ii) 2.99 times his salary and annual bonus plus the difference between the exercise price of any exercisable options having an exercise price of less than the then current market price of our common stock and such current market price. Mr. Lorber will also receive a tax gross up payment to cover any excise tax.\nChanges in the U.S. healthcare system could increase our cost of doing business.\nIn March 2010, the federal government passed new legislation to reform the U.S. health care system. As part of the plan, employers will be expected to provide their employees with minimum levels of healthcare coverage or incur certain financial penalties. Our workforce includes numerous part-time workers, which may increase our health care costs and expose us to certain excise taxes, in the event that healthcare is offered to less than 95% of our full-time employees, as defined by the legislation. Additionally, some states and localities have passed state and local laws mandating the provision of certain levels of health benefits by some employers. Increased health care costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws and unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax expense.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally. From time to time, the United States Congress and foreign, state and local governments consider legislation that could increase our effective tax rates. If changes to applicable tax laws are enacted, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. Our tax returns and positions (including positions regarding jurisdictional authority of foreign governments to impose tax) are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. An unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Notes\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes and our other debt.\nAs of March 27, 2016, we had $135.0 million of indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:\n\u25cf\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our other financial obligations, including our obligations relating to the Notes;\n\u25cf\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our lenders, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds or increase our cost of borrowing.\nMoreover, because of the interest payments we are required to make, our net income for fiscal 2016 and beyond will have a significant negative impact compared to our reported net income in fiscal 2015 period and prior periods. As we entered into the indenture on March 10, 2015 we were only required to accrue interest expense for 20 days during the fiscal 2015 period. In contrast, the full year impact of interest expense on net income has been reflected in our year end results for the period ended March 27, 2016 and will be reflected in future periods so long as the Notes remain outstanding.\nIn addition, the terms of the indenture governing the Notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts, including the Notes. The occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects or ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.\nDespite our current indebtedness level, we may still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional Notes and other secured indebtedness, in the future. Although the indenture governing the Notes will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we face would intensify and we may not be able to meet all our debt obligations, including the repayment of the Notes. In addition, the indenture governing the Notes will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under the indenture.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. As such, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service the Notes or our other indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, to fund planned capital expenditures and to maintain sufficient working capital will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we may need to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Notes, on or before the maturity thereof, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that the terms of that indebtedness will allow any of the above alternative measures or that these measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to repay or refinance our debt on favorable terms, it could significantly adversely affect our financial condition, the value of our outstanding debt, including the Notes, and our ability to make any required cash payments under our indebtedness, including the Notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at that time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, any future credit facility may be secured by a priority lien on substantially all of our assets. As such, our ability to refinance the Notes or seek additional financing could be impaired as a result of such security interest.\nWe are subject to a number of restrictive covenants, which may restrict our business and financing activities.\nThe indenture governing the Notes will impose, and the terms of any future indebtedness may impose, operating and other restrictions on us. Such restrictions will affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u25cf\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;\n\u25cf\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our equity interests;\n\u25cf\nredeem, repurchase or retire our equity interests, unsecured indebtedness or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nmake certain investments;\n\u25cf\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u25cf\ncreate or incur certain liens;\n\u25cf\ncreate restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u25cf\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u25cf\nengage in certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u25cf\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe restrictions in the indenture governing the Notes may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interests of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We also may incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. Our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will largely depend on the pricing of our products and services, and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements. The breach of any of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the Notes, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 78900, "SIC": 2013, "TIC": "NATH"}
