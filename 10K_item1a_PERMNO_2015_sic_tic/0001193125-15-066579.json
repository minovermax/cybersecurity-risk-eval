Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating us and this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d are forward-looking statements. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe could be adversely affected by a decline in discretionary consumer spending or consumer confidence.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is heavily influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. In the past, severe economic downturns, coupled with high volatility and uncertainty as to the future global economic landscape, have had an adverse effect on consumers\u2019 discretionary income and consumer confidence.\nDifficult economic conditions and recessionary periods may adversely impact attendance figures, the frequency with which guests choose to visit our theme parks and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. The actual or perceived weakness in the economy could also lead to decreased spending by our guests. For example, in 2009 and 2010, we experienced a decline in attendance as a result of the global economic crisis, which in turn adversely affected our revenue and profitability. Both attendance and total per capita spending at our theme parks are key drivers of our revenue and profitability, and reductions in either can materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks.\nVarious factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. These factors could also affect our suppliers, vendors, insurance carriers and other contractual counterparties. Such factors include:\n\u2022\nwar, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events;\n\u2022\noutbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases or consumers\u2019 concerns relating to potential exposure to contagious diseases;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, floods and volcanic eruptions and man-made disasters such as the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which may deter travelers from scheduling vacations or cause them to cancel travel or vacation plans;\n\u2022\nbad weather and even forecasts of bad weather, including abnormally hot, cold and/or wet weather, particularly during weekends, holidays or other peak periods;\n\u2022\nchanges in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of our guests;\n\u2022\nlow consumer confidence;\n\u2022\noil prices and travel costs and the financial condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries, any travel-related disruptions or incidents and their impact on travel;\n\u2022\nactions or statements by U.S. and foreign governmental officials related to travel and corporate travel-related activities (including changes to the U.S. visa rules) and the resulting public perception of such travel and activities; and\n\u2022\ninterruption of public or private utility services to our theme parks.\nAny one or more of these factors could adversely affect attendance and total per capita spending at our theme parks, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts.\nWe operate in a complex and evolving regulatory environment and are subject to various federal and state statutes and regulations and international treaties implemented by federal law. The states in which we operate also regulate zoological activity involving the import and export of exotic and native wildlife, endangered and/or otherwise protected species, zoological display and anti-cruelty statutes. We incur significant compliance costs in connection with these regulations and violation of such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and result in the loss of our licenses and permits, which, if occurred, could impact our ability to display certain animals. Future amendments to existing statutes, regulations and treaties or new statutes, regulations and treaties may potentially restrict our ability to maintain our animals, or to acquire new ones to supplement or sustain our breeding programs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For instance, in March of 2014 a bill was proposed by a California lawmaker that seeks to restrict our ability to display certain animals in that state. Also, in June of 2014 the U.S. House of Representatives adopted an amendment that, if enacted, would encourage the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to update existing regulations for marine mammals in domestic zoos and aquaria. It is unclear whether the language of the amendment may be further modified or if the underlying legislation will be enacted into law.\nFrom time to time, animal activist and other third-party groups may make claims before government agencies, bring lawsuits against us, and/or attempt to generate negative publicity associated with our business. Such activities sometimes are based on allegations that we do not properly care for some of our featured animals. On other occasions, such activities are specifically designed to change existing law or enact new law in order to impede our ability to retain, exhibit, acquire or breed animals. While we seek to structure our operations to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and vigorously defend ourselves when sued, there are no assurances as to the outcome of future claims and lawsuits that could be brought against us. In addition, negative publicity associated with such activities could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. At times, activists and other third-party groups have also attempted to generate negative publicity related to our relationships with our business partners, such as corporate sponsors, promotional partners, vendors, ticket resellers and others. For example, in 2014, we experienced demand pressures, particularly in California, which we believe were partly due to media attention relating to the recent legislation proposed in that state. In addition, we experienced increased media attention in 2014 extending to our relationships with some of our business partners.\nIncidents or adverse publicity concerning our theme parks or the theme park industry generally could harm our brands or reputation as well as negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nOur brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality of our theme parks and services and our corporate and management integrity. The operation of theme parks involves the risk of accidents, illnesses, environmental incidents and other incidents which may negatively affect the perception of guest and employee safety, health, security and guest satisfaction and which could negatively impact our brands or reputation and our business and results of operations. An accident or an injury at any of our theme parks or at theme parks operated by competitors, particularly an accident or an injury involving the safety of guests and employees, that receives media attention, is the topic of a book, film, documentary or is otherwise the subject of public discussions, may harm our brands or reputation, cause a loss of consumer confidence in the Company, reduce attendance at our theme parks and negatively impact our results of operations. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. In addition, other types of adverse publicity concerning our business or the theme park industry generally could harm our brands, reputation and results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patent and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of the value of the Company. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third-party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in any given case, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights, breaching any contractual obligations to us, or independently developing intellectual property that is similar to ours, any of which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affect our revenues or otherwise harm our business.\nWe have obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign trademark and service mark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and service marks or other intellectual property, as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. A failure to obtain registrations for our intellectual property in the United States and other countries could limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions.\nWe are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property rights. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome, costly and divert the attention of our personnel, and we may not prevail. In addition, any repeal or weakening of laws or enforcement in the United States or internationally intended to protect intellectual property rights could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value and increasing the cost of enforcing our rights.\nWe may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and result in the loss of significant intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of our business based on allegations of infringement or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims can divert the efforts of our personnel and are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial money damages or discontinue, modify or rename certain products or services that are found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license (if available on acceptable terms, or at all) to continue offering products and services, which may significantly increase our operating expenses.\nAnimals in our care are important to our theme parks, and they could be exposed to infectious diseases.\nMany of our theme parks are distinguished from those of our competitors in that we offer guest interactions with animals. Individual animals, specific species of animals or groups of animals in our zoological collection could be exposed to infectious diseases. While we have never had any such experiences, an outbreak of an infectious disease among any animals in our theme parks or the public\u2019s perception that a certain disease could be harmful to human health may materially adversely affect our zoological collection, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFeaturing animals at our theme parks involves risks.\nOur theme parks feature numerous displays and interactions that include animals. All animal enterprises involve some degree of risk. All animal interaction by our employees and our guests in attractions in our theme\nparks, where offered, involves risk. While we maintain strict safety procedures for the protection of our employees and guests, injuries or death, while rare, have occurred in the past. For example, in February 2010, a trainer was killed while engaged in an interaction with a killer whale. Following this incident, we were subject to an inspection by the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), which resulted in three citations concerning alleged violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and certain regulations thereunder. In 2012, we initiated an appeal of certain of these citations with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On April 11, 2014, the Court of Appeals denied our appeal and we have elected to not pursue further appeal. In connection with this incident, we reviewed and revised our safety protocols and made certain safety-related facility enhancements such as revising training protocols used in show performances. This incident has also been and continues to be the subject of significant media attention, including extensive television and newspaper coverage, a documentary and a book, as well as discussions in social media. This incident and similar events that may occur in the future may harm our reputation, reduce attendance and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, six killer whales are presently on loan to a third party. Although the occurrence of any accident or injury involving these killer whales would be outside of our control, any such occurrence could negatively affect our business and reputation.\nWe maintain insurance of the type and in amounts that we believe is commercially reasonable and that is available to animal enterprise related businesses in the theme park industry. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any self-insurance retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available, or the availability of coverage for specific risks.\nIf we lose licenses and permits required to exhibit animals and/or violate laws and regulations, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe are required to hold government licenses and permits, some of which are subject to yearly or periodic renewal, for purposes of possessing, exhibiting and maintaining animals. Although our theme parks\u2019 licenses and permits have always been renewed in the past, in the event that any of our licenses or permits are not renewed or any of our licenses or permits are revoked, portions of the affected theme park might not be able to remain open for purpose of displaying or retaining the animals covered by such license or permit. Such an outcome could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to periodic inspections by federal and state agencies and the subsequent issuance of inspection reports. While we believe that we comply with, or exceed, requisite care and maintenance standards that apply to our animals, government inspectors can cite us for alleged statutory or regulatory violations. In unusual instances when we are cited for an alleged deficiency, we are most often given the opportunity to correct any purported deficiencies without penalty. It is possible, however, that in some cases a federal or state regulator could seek to impose monetary fines on us. In the past, when we have been subjected to governmental claims for fines, the amounts involved were not material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, while highly unlikely, we cannot predict whether any future fines that regulators might seek to impose would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMoreover, many of the statutes under which we operate allow for the imposition of criminal sanctions. While neither of the foregoing situations are likely to occur, either could negatively affect the business, financial condition or results of operations at our theme parks.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia and in the Orlando market. Any risks affecting such markets, such as natural disasters and travel-related disruptions or incidents, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApproximately 56%, 19% and 13% of our revenues in 2014 were generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia, respectively. In addition, our revenues and results of operations depend significantly on the results of our Orlando theme parks. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies.\nAny risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as the occurrence of natural disasters and travel-related disruptions or incidents, affecting the States of Florida, California and Virginia generally or our Orlando theme parks in particular may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, especially if they have the effect of decreasing attendance at our theme parks or, in extreme cases, cause us to close any of our theme parks for any period of time. For example, in 2004, the State of Florida was impacted by Hurricanes Charley, Frances and Jeanne, which caused extensive physical damage and power outages in various parts of the State of Florida. Although we attempted to manage our exposure to such events by implementing our hurricane preparedness plan, our theme parks located in Orlando and Tampa, Florida experienced closures of several days as a result of these storms.\nBecause we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively.\nThe entertainment industry, and the theme park industry in particular, is highly competitive. Our theme parks compete with other theme, water and amusement parks and with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel.\nPrincipal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Studios, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, Merlin Entertainments and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. The principal competitive factors of a theme park include location, price, originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of its food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. Certain of our direct competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do, and they may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in guest preferences or devote greater resources to promotion of their offerings and attractions than us. Our competitors may be able to attract guests to their theme parks in lieu of our own through the development or acquisition of new rides, attractions or shows that are perceived by guests to be of a higher quality and entertainment value. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully against such competitors. For example, in 2014, we experienced negative attendance trends, primarily at our destination parks in Florida, which we believe was due in part to significant new attraction offerings at competitor destination parks, along with a delay in the scheduled opening of one of our new rides at our Busch Gardens Tampa park.\nIf we lose key personnel, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon a number of key employees, including members of our senior management team who have extensive experience in the industry. The loss of the services of our key employees could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Presently, we do not have any employment agreements with any of our key employees.\nIncreased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our results of operations.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our managers and employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, increased\nminimum wage or employee benefit costs or otherwise, would adversely impact our operating expenses. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the amendments thereto contain provisions that have impacted our healthcare costs. It is possible that any future amendments could significantly increase our compensation costs, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.\nUnionization activities or labor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability.\nAlthough none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If some or all of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs.\nAlthough we maintain binding policies that require employees to submit to a mandatory alternative dispute resolution procedure in lieu of other remedies, as employers, we may be subject to various employment-related claims, such as individual or class actions or government enforcement actions relating to alleged employment discrimination, employee classification and related withholding, wage-hour, labor standards or healthcare and benefit issues. Such actions, if brought against us and successful in whole or in part, may affect our ability to compete or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to meet our workforce needs.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with our needs, including employees with certain specialized skills in the field of animal training and care. If we are unable to do so, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we employ a significant seasonal workforce. We recruit year-round to fill thousands of seasonal staffing positions each season and work to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place. There is no assurance that we will be able to recruit and hire adequate seasonal personnel as the business requires or that we will not experience material increases in the cost of securing our seasonal workforce in the future. Increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur growth strategy may not achieve the anticipated results.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to grow our business, including through capital investments to improve existing and create new theme parks, rides, attractions and shows, as well as in-park product offerings and product offerings outside of our theme parks. Our growth and innovation strategies require significant commitments of management resources and capital investments and may not grow our revenues at the rate we expect or at all. As a result, we may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing our new projects and initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to fund theme park capital expenditures and investment in future attractions and projects.\nA principal competitive factor for a theme park is the originality and perceived quality of its rides and attractions. We need to make continued capital investments through maintenance and the regular addition of new rides and attractions. We recently announced an initiative called the Blue World Project that involves building first-of-its-kind killer whale environments at all three SeaWorld parks. The total investment is expected to be approximately $100.0 million per park by the project\u2019s completion. The first of these environments will be built at SeaWorld San Diego and is expected to open to the public in 2018 with new killer whale environments to\nfollow at SeaWorld Orlando and SeaWorld San Antonio. Our ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to raise capital from third parties. We cannot assure you that our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such costs, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects or plans.\nThe high fixed cost structure of theme park operations can result in significantly lower margins if revenues decline.\nA large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed because the costs for full-time employees, maintenance, animal care, utilities, advertising and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance. These fixed costs may increase at a greater rate than our revenues and may not be able to be reduced at the same rate as declining revenues. If cost-cutting efforts are insufficient to offset declines in revenues or are impracticable, we could experience a material decline in margins, revenues, profitability and reduced or negative cash flows. Such effects can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth, such as the recent economic recession.\nIf we are unable to maintain certain commercial licenses, our business, reputation and brand could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on licenses from Sesame Workshop to use the Sesame Place trade name and trademark and certain other intellectual property rights, including titles, marks, characters, logos and designs from the Sesame Street television series within our Sesame Place theme park and with respect to Sesame Street themed areas within certain areas of some of our other theme parks, as well as in connection with the sales of certain Sesame Street themed products. Our use of these intellectual property rights is subject to the approval of Sesame Workshop and the licenses may be terminated in certain limited circumstances or in the event of our bankruptcy. Furthermore, the current term of both the Sesame Place theme park license and the multi-park license expire on December 31, 2021, and there is no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate the use of such intellectual property on commercially acceptable terms or at all. The new terms of the licenses may significantly increase our operating expenses, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nABI is the owner of the Busch Gardens trademarks and domain names. ABI has granted us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the license, we are required to indemnify ABI against losses related to our use of the marks. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate this license, our business may be adversely affected.\nChanges in consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of our business.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to consistently provide, maintain and expand theme park attractions as well as create and distribute media programming, online material and consumer products that meet changing consumer preferences. In addition, consumers from outside the United States constitute an increasingly important portion of our theme park attendance, and our success depends in part on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to tastes and preferences of this consumer group. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if consumer preferences change, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur existing debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur existing debt agreements contain, and documents governing our future indebtedness may contain, numerous financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and other distributions, make capital expenditures, make certain loans, investments and other restricted payments, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, engage in certain transactions with stockholders or affiliates, sell certain assets or engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, amend or otherwise alter the terms of our indebtedness, alter the business that we conduct, guarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations and create liens. Our existing debt agreements also require, and documents governing our future indebtedness may require, us to meet certain financial ratios and tests. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the existing debt agreements is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or non-compliance with any of these financial ratios and tests could result in an event of default under the existing debt agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to the risk of higher interest rates, which could cause our future debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2014, our total indebtedness was approximately $1,603.5 million. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, future business opportunities, share repurchases pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program and capital expenditures; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) certain of the borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates; (iv) we are at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors; (v) we may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; (vi) the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and (vii) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. If unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. We from time to time may increase the amount of our indebtedness, modify the terms of our financing arrangements, issue dividends, make capital expenditures and take other actions that may substantially increase our leverage.\nDespite our significant leverage, we may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nWe have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our annual theme park attendance and revenue, which are typically higher in our second and third quarters, partly because six of our theme parks are only open for a portion of the year. Approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we typically incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. In addition, school vacations and school start dates also cause fluctuations in our quarterly theme park attendance and revenue.\nFurthermore, the operating season at some of our theme parks, including Adventure Island, Aquatica San Diego, Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Water Country USA and Sesame Place, is of limited duration. In addition, most of our expenses for maintenance and costs of adding new attractions at our seasonal theme parks are incurred when the operating season is over, which may increase the need for borrowing to fund such expenses during such periods.\nWhen conditions or events described in this section occur during the operating season, particularly during the second and third quarters, there is only a limited period of time during which the impact of those conditions or events can be mitigated. Accordingly, such conditions or events may have a disproportionately adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow.\nWe may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic initiatives.\nOur business strategy may include selective expansion, both domestically and internationally, through acquisitions of assets or other strategic initiatives, such as joint ventures, that allow us to profitably expand our business and leverage our brands. The success of our acquisitions depends on effective integration of acquired businesses and assets into our operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of an acquired businesses or assets. Additionally, any international transactions are subject to additional risks, including the impact of economic fluctuations in economies outside of the United States, difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, as well as political instability and lesser degree of legal protection in certain jurisdictions, currency exchange fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences of overseas operations.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business.\nWe are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, which may include claims by third parties, including guests who visit our theme parks, our employees or regulators. We are currently subject to securities litigation. We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are subject to in greater detail below under the caption \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. The outcome of many of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, a judgment, a fine or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur, or injunctive relief were issued against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer and our insurance costs may increase.\nWe seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates. Although we maintain various safety and loss prevention programs and carry property and casualty insurance to cover certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities. There can be no assurance that our\ninsurance will be sufficient to cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, if we or other theme park operators sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims, then our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to purchase or contract with third-party manufacturers for our theme park rides and attractions.\nWe may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to build high quality rides and attractions and to continue to service and maintain those rides and attractions at competitive or beneficial prices, or to provide the replacement parts needed to maintain the operation of such rides. In addition, if our third-party suppliers\u2019 financial condition deteriorates or they go out of business, we may not be able to obtain the full benefit of manufacturer warranties or indemnities typically contained in our contracts or may need to incur greater costs for the maintenance, repair, replacement or insurance of these assets.\nOur operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental requirements, and to environmental expenditures and liabilities.\nWe incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to water use, wastewater and storm water management and disposal, air emissions control, hazardous materials management, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the clean-up of properties affected by regulated materials.\nWe have been required and continue to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases, and other releases, from current or formerly owned or operated facilities. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we generate, use and dispose of large volumes of water, including saltwater, which requires us to comply with a number of federal, state and local regulations and to incur significant expenses. Failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and/or require us to incur additional expenses. Although we are not now classified as a large quantity generator of hazardous waste, we do store and handle hazardous materials to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities and have done so historically.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not be required to incur substantial costs to comply with new or expanded environmental requirements in the future or to investigate or clean-up new or newly identified environmental conditions, which could also impair our ability to use or transfer the affected properties and to obtain financing.\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of internal or guest data could result in damages to our reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nWe collect and retain large volumes of internal and guest data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, for business purposes, including for transactional or target marketing and promotional purposes, and our various information technology systems enter, process, summarize and report such data. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our guest, employee and Company data is critical to our business and our guests and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on us by the credit card industry, governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our theme parks, products and services to our guests. We face various security threats, including cyber security attacks on our data (including our vendors\u2019 and customers\u2019 data) and/or information technology infrastructure. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no\nassurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent penetrations or disruptions to our systems. Furthermore, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of guest, employee or Company data which could harm our reputation or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits and require significant management attention and resources to be spent. In addition, our insurance coverage and indemnification arrangements that we enter into, if any, may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. To date, cyber security attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. Due to the evolving nature of security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nThe suspension or termination of any of our business licenses may have a negative impact on our business.\nWe maintain a variety of business licenses issued by federal, state and local authorities that are renewable on a periodic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in renewing all of our licenses on a periodic basis. The suspension, termination or expiration of one or more of these licenses could materially adversely affect our revenues and profits. In addition, any changes to the licensing requirements for any of our licenses could affect our ability to maintain the licenses.\nWe have a limited operating history as a stand-alone company, which makes it difficult to predict our future prospects and financial performance.\nImmediately following the 2009 Transactions, we began operating as a stand-alone company, and, as a result, have a limited operating history as an independent company. Accordingly, you should consider our future prospects in light of the risks and challenges encountered by a company with a limited operating history. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully meet the challenges, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties encountered by us or that we will be successful in accomplishing our objectives. Our limited operating history as a stand-alone company makes it difficult to predict our future prospects and financial performance.\nAffiliates of Blackstone will continue to be able to significantly influence our decisions and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nAffiliates of Blackstone beneficially own approximately 21.9% of our common stock. As a result, investment funds associated with or designated by affiliates of Blackstone will have the ability to elect members of our Board of Directors and thereby continue to influence our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In addition, Blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, Blackstone may be interested in making acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or in selling revenue-generating assets. Additionally, in certain circumstances, acquisitions of debt at a discount by purchasers that are related to a debtor can give rise to cancellation of indebtedness income to such debtor for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nBlackstone is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. For example, Blackstone owns a stake in Merlin Entertainments Group, which operates the Legoland theme parks, and certain other investments in the leisure and hospitality industries.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of Blackstone, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our\nofficers in both his director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Blackstone also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as affiliates of Blackstone continue to own a significant amount of our combined voting power, even if such amount is less than 50%, Blackstone will continue to be able to influence our decisions and, so long as Blackstone and its affiliates collectively own at least 5% of all outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, it will be able to appoint individuals to our Board of Directors under the stockholders agreement. In addition, Blackstone will be able to influence the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval and prevent a change of control of the Company or a change in the composition of our Board of Directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of the Company. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of the Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in April 2013 through December 31, 2014, our common stock price has ranged from $15.43 to $38.92. In addition to the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond or control, including:\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the market prices of stocks generally, or those of amusement and theme parks companies;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in business or regulatory conditions;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nrepurchases of our common stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to litigation;\n\u2022\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe intend to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock, subject to our compliance with applicable law, and depending on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. However, the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future. Based on the Company\u2019s debt covenant calculations as of September 30, 2014, the Company was limited for the remainder of calendar year 2014 in its ability to declare dividends in an amount consistent with its previously announced dividend policy. The amount available for dividend payments under the Company\u2019s debt covenants resets on January 1, 2015, which caused our Board of Directors to shift the timing of the fourth quarter 2014 dividend from mid-December 2014 to early January 2015.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our recently announced share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nOn August 12, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $250.0 million of our common stock beginning on January 1, 2015 (the \u201cShare Repurchase Program\u201d). On December 16, 2014, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Share Repurchase Program to change the start date of such program from January 1, 2015 to December 17, 2014 and to authorize the repurchase of up to $15.0 million of our common stock during the remainder of calendar year 2014. Under the Share Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased a total of 855,970 shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $15.0 million, leaving $235.0 million available for future repurchases.\nRepurchases of our common stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of the Share Repurchase Program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although the Share Repurchase Program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce such program\u2019s effectiveness.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nShares held by the Partnerships and certain of our directors, officers and employees are eligible for resale, subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the 2009 Transactions, we granted the Partnerships the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of our common stock under the Securities Act.\nAs restrictions on resale end or if the Partnerships exercise their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities.\nIn addition, the shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to provisions relating to various vesting agreements, lock-up agreements and Rule 144, as applicable. A total of 15,000,000 shares of common stock was reserved for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, of which 14,408,339 shares of common stock remain available for future issuance at February 23, 2015. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you.\nOur restructuring program may not achieve its intended results.\nWe recently embarked on a restructuring program in an effort to centralize certain operations and reduce duplication of functions to increase efficiencies as part our Company-wide initiative designed to deliver approximately $50.0 million of annual cost savings in comparison to our current cost structure by the end of 2015. Achieving our anticipated cost savings goal is subject to a number of uncertainties, including additional unanticipated costs, expenses, liabilities or necessary competitive responses. There can be no assurance regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize our goals.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.\nThese provisions provide for, among other things:\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;\n\u2022\ncertain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe removal of directors only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2\u20443% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; and\n\u2022\nthat certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2\u20443% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nThe requirements of being a public entity and sustaining our growth may strain our resources.\nAs a result of becoming a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and requirements pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting as required by the Exchange Act, significant resources and management oversight are required. We have implemented additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. In addition, sustaining our growth also requires us to commit additional management, operational, and financial resources to identify new professionals to join the Company and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in our implementation of our internal controls over financial reporting could result in material misstatements that are not prevented or detected on a timely basis. Ineffective internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements and cause a decline in the price of our common stock. If we identify any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future, or encounter problems or delays in the implementation of internal controls over financial reporting, we may be unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nNon-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of our common stock.\nWe believe that we are currently a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. So long as our common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, a non-U.S. stockholder who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder\u2019s holding period) more than 5% of our common stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13860, "SIC": 7996, "TIC": "SEAS"}
