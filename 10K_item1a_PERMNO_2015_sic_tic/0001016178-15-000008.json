These risk factors do not necessarily appear in the order of importance.\nCarver is subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact the Company's return on equity, or constrain it from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, the FDIC and the FRB approved a new rule that will substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also established a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nCarver's results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchases from U.S. Government Sponsored entities (\u201cGSE's\u201d).\nIn connection with the sale of loans, Carver as the loan originator is required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding the originator and the loans that are being sold. If a loan does not comply with the representations and warranties, Carver may be obligated to repurchase the loans, and in doing so, incur any loss directly. Prior to December 31, 2009, the Bank originated and sold loans to the Federal National Mortgage Association (\"FNMA\"). During fiscal years 2012 through 2015, the Bank has been obligated to repurchase 20 loans previously sold to FNMA. There is no assurance that the Bank will not be required to repurchase additional loans in the future. Accordingly, any repurchase obligations to FNMA could materially and adversely affect the Bank's results of operations and earnings in the future.\nThe prolonged negative effect of the recession and weak economic recovery will continue to adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe severe recession and weak economic recovery has resulted in continued uncertainty in the financial and credit markets in general. The FRB, in an attempt to stimulate the overall economy, has, among other things, kept interest rates historically low through its targeted federal funds rate and purchased mortgage-backed securities. While this has helped prevent the economy from deteriorating further and reduced the Bank's cost of funds, the low rates have made it difficult for the Bank to earn interest income on investments and loans. If the FRB increases the federal funds rate, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets, business' ability to borrow and the U.S. economic recovery. Regardless of the cause or the FRB's response, a prolonged weakness in the economy generally, and in the financial services industry in particular, could continue to negatively affect our operations in multiple ways, including the ability to originate new loans at reasonable rates and the continued deterioration of our loan portfolio, requiring increased provisions and costs to mange problem assets.\nCarver's results of operations are affected by economic conditions in the New York metropolitan area.\nAt March 31, 2015, a significant majority of the Bank's lending portfolio was concentrated in the New York metropolitan area. As a result of this geographic concentration, Carver's results of operations are largely dependent on economic conditions in this area. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans to our borrowers. Adverse changes in the economy caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond the Bank's control may also continue to have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely mortgage or business loan payments, which would have an adverse impact on earnings. Consequently, deterioration in economic conditions in the New York metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of the Bank's loan portfolio, which could result in increased delinquencies, decreased interest income results as well as an adverse impact on loan loss experience with probable increased allowance for loan losses. Such deterioration also could adversely impact the demand for products and services, and, accordingly, further negatively affect results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover Carver's actual loan losses.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income.\nIn addition, the OCC periodically reviews the allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. A material increase in the allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by the regulatory authorities would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nCarver's concentration in commercial real estate loans and multifamily loans could, in a deteriorating economic climate, expose the Company to increased lending risks and related loan losses.\nAlthough Carver Federal has reduced its concentration in non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans to within Board approved policy limits, Carver Federal continues to maintain a high concentration in this product area and has begun, on a select basis, to renew existing loans and make new loans. However, further deterioration in the economy could expose Carver Federal to additional losses in these loan types.\nChanges in interest rate environment may negatively affect Carver Federal's net income, mortgage loan originations and valuation of available-for-sale securities.\nOur primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of loans and, to a lesser extent, securities) and the interest expense produced by our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits and wholesale borrowings).\nThe cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is driven by the Federal Open Market Committee of the FRB. However, the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by intermediate-term (i.e., five-year) interest rates, which are set by the market and generally vary from day to day. The level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates, and the pace at which such movements occur. If the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-earning assets, the result could be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in our earnings. Our net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on our interest-earning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nIn addition, such changes in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits; the fair values of our securities and other financial assets; the fair values of our liabilities; and the average lives of our loan and securities portfolios.\nChanges in interest rates could also have an effect on loan refinancing activity which, in turn, would impact the amount of prepayment penalty income we receive on our multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Because prepayment penalties are recorded as interest income, the extent to which they increase or decrease during any given period could have a significant impact on the level of net interest income and net income we generate during that time.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates could have an effect on the slope of the yield curve. If the yield curve were to invert or become flat, our net interest income and net interest margin could contract, adversely affecting our net income and cash flows and the value of our assets.\nIn addition, the actual amount of time before mortgage and business loans and mortgage-backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in mortgage prepayment rates and prevailing market interest rates impacting not only Carver Federal's interest income, but Carver Federal's liquidity. Mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors, including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated, seasonal factors, demographic variables and the ability to assume the underlying mortgages. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates, related loan refinancing opportunities and competition.\nFinally, the estimated fair value of the Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease materially depending on changes in interest rates. Carver Federal's securities portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate securities.\nStrong competition within the Bank's market areas could adversely affect profits and slow growth.\nThe New York metropolitan area has a high density of financial institutions, of which many are significantly larger than Carver Federal and with greater financial resources. Additionally, various large out-of-state financial institutions may continue to enter the New York metropolitan area market. All are considered competitors to varying degrees.\nCarver Federal faces intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Competition for loans, both locally and in the aggregate, comes principally from mortgage banking companies, commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations. Most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. The Bank also faces competition for deposits from money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds, as well as from other financial intermediaries, such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. Market area competition is a factor in pricing the Bank's loans and deposits, which could reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more challenging to effectively grow loan and deposit balances. The Company's profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market areas.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure controls could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of the Company\u2019s ongoing monitoring of internal controls, it may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control that require remediation. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company continually works on improving its internal controls. However, the Company cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that it implements and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of the Company\u2019s internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nCarver and the Bank operate in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of business activities.\nCarver Federal is subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the OCC and to a lesser extent the FDIC. The Company is subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the FRB. As a result, Carver Federal and the Company are limited in the manner in which Carver Federal and the Company conducts its business, undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and depositors, and not to benefit the Company's stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. In addition, Carver Federal must comply with significant anti-money laundering\nand anti-terrorism laws. Government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws.\nOn October 4, 2006, the OCC and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risk, or (the \"Guidance\"). In general, the Guidance applies to all residential mortgage loan products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal or interest. The Guidance describes sound practices for managing risk, as well as marketing, originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products, which include, among other things, interest-only loans. The Guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards, portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection. For example, the Guidance indicates that originating interest-only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower's repayment capacity. Specifically, the Guidance indicates that a lender may accept a borrower's statement as to the borrower's income without obtaining verification only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity and that, for many borrowers, institutions should be able to readily document income.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) is significantly changing the current bank regulatory structure and affecting the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. However, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations will materially increase our operating and compliance costs.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the primary enforcement authority of their prudential regulator rather than the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk-based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks, which will exclude certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as Tier 1 capital, such as trust preferred securities.\nEffective July 21, 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts, which could result in an increase in our interest expense.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution, rather than deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009, and non-interest bearing transaction accounts had unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2012. The legislation also increases the required minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits, and directs the FDIC to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments. It also provides that the listing standards of the national securities exchanges shall require listed companies to implement and disclose \u201cclawback\u201d policies mandating the recovery of incentive compensation paid to executive officers in connection with accounting restatements. The legislation also directs the FRB to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives.\nEffective December 10, 2013, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking and securities regulators issued final rules to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d). Generally, subject to a transition period and certain exceptions, the Volcker Rule restricts insured depository institutions and their affiliated companies from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific\nidentified risk. After the transition period, the Volcker Rule prohibitions and restrictions will apply to banking entities, including the Company, unless an exception applies.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulatory entities, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nOur Common Stock may be delisted if we are not able to meet the NASDAQ continued listing requirements.\nOn November 30, 2011, we received notice from the NASDAQ Stock Market that the NASDAQ Hearings Panel had made a determination to transfer the listing of the Company's common stock from the NASDAQ Global Market to the NASDAQ Capital Market effective at the opening of the market on December 2, 2011. Although we believe that we are now in compliance with all continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, we may not be able to remain in compliance at all times. If we fail to meet the continued listing requirements, our shares of Common Stock may be delisted and we may be forced to list our shares of Common Stock on another exchange or quotation service. If this occurs, our Common Stock may become illiquid, and the price of our Common Stock may be negatively affected.\nRestrictions on the Company and the Bank stemming from the Treasury's equity interest in the Company may have a material effect on results of operations.\nOn January 20, 2009, the Company became a TARP CPP participant by completing the sale of $18.98 million in preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury. As a participant, among other things, the Company must adopt the Treasury's standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the Treasury holds equity issued under this program. These standards would generally apply to the Company's CEO, CFO and the three next most highly compensated officers (\u201cSenior Executive\u201d). The standards include (1) ensuring that incentive compensation for Senior Executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution; (2) required claw-back of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a Senior Executive based on statements of earnings, gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate; (3) prohibition on making golden parachute payments to Senior Executives; and (4) agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of $500,000 for each Senior Executive. In particular, the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation would likely increase slightly the overall cost of the Company's compensation programs. the Company also had to adopt certain monitoring and reporting processes.\nOn August 27, 2010, the Company redeemed the preferred stock and issued $18.98 million in Series B preferred stock in connection with the Company's changing its participation from TARP CPP to TARP Community Development Capital Initiative (\"CDCI\"). On October 25, 2011 Carver's shareholders approved the conversion of TARP CDCI Series B preferred stock to common stock. On October 28, 2011, the Treasury converted the CDCI Series B preferred stock to Carver common stock. Under the terms of the agreement between the Treasury and the Company, the Company agreed that so long as the Treasury has an equity interest in the Company, it will continue to be bound by all of the current restrictions and requirements that the Treasury may choose to implement. The Company is unable to determine the impact that future restrictions and/or requirements resulting from the Treasury's ownership interest may have on the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity.\nLiquidity refers to the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support operations and to fulfill obligations, including commitments to originate loans, to repay wholesale borrowings, and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by customers.\nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated through the repayment of loans and securities, cash flows from the sale of loans and securities, deposits gathered organically through the Bank's branch network, from socially motivated depositors, city and state agencies and deposit brokers and borrowed funds, primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings from the FHLB-NY. In addition, and depending on current market conditions, the Company has the ability to access the capital markets from time to time.\nDeposit flows, calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings, and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates, whether actual or perceived, local and national economic conditions and competition for deposits and loans in the markets the Bank serves. Furthermore, changes to the FHLB-NY's underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings may limit or restrict the Bank's ability to borrow, and could therefore have a significant adverse impact on liquidity.\nA decline in available funding could adversely impact the Bank's ability to originate loans, invest in securities, and meet expenses, or to fulfill such obligations as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands.\nThe Bank's ability to pay dividends or lend funds to the Company is subject to regulatory limitations that may prevent the Company from making future dividend payments or principal and interest payments on its debt obligation.\nCarver is a unitary savings and loan association holding company regulated by the OCC and FRB and almost all of its operating assets are owned by Carver Federal. Carver relies primarily on dividends from the Bank to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, to engage in share repurchase programs and to pay principal and interest on its trust preferred debt obligation. The OCC regulates all capital distributions by the Bank to the Company, including dividend payments payments and the Federal Reserve Board regulates dividends by the Company. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company, Carver Federal must file a notice or an application (depending on the proposed dividend amount) with the OCC prior to each capital distribution. The OCC will disallow any proposed dividend that would result in failure to meet the OCC minimum capital requirements. In accordance with the Orders, the Bank is currently prohibited from paying any dividends without prior regulatory approval, and, as such, has suspended the Company's regularly quarterly cash dividend on its common stock. There are no assurances that the payments of dividends on the common stock will resume. The FRB also precluded future payment of debenture interest payments on the Carver Statutory Trust I capital securities. These payments remain on deferral status.\nCarver may not be able to utilize its income tax benefits.\nThe Company's ability to utilize the deferred tax asset generated by New Markets Tax Credit income tax benefits as well as other deferred tax assets depends on its ability to meet the NMTC compliance requirements and its ability to generate sufficient taxable income from operations in the future. Since the Bank has not generated sufficient taxable income to utilize tax credits as they were earned, a deferred tax asset has been recorded in the Company's financial statements. For additional information regarding Carver's NMTC, refer to Item 7, \"Variable Interest Entities.\"\nThe future recognition of Carver's deferred tax asset is highly dependent upon Carver's ability to generate sufficient taxable income. A valuation allowance is required to be maintained for any deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. In assessing Carver's need for a valuation allowance, we rely upon estimates of future taxable income. Although we use the best available information to estimate future taxable income, underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances influencing our projections. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory rates, and future taxable income levels. The Company determined that it would not be able to realize all of its net deferred tax assets in the future, as such a charge to income tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was made. Conversely, if the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, the Company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease in income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made.\nOn June 29, 2011, the Company raised $55 million of equity. The capital raise triggered a change in control under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, Section 382 limits the utilization of an entity's net operating loss carry forwards, general business credits, and recognized built-in losses upon a change in ownership. The Company is subject to an annual limitation of approximately $0.9 million. The Company has a net deferred tax asset (\u201cDTA\u201d) of approximately $29.2 million. Based on management's calculations, the Section 382 limitation has resulted in previous reductions of the deferred tax asset of $5.8 million. The Company also continues to maintain a full valuation allowance for the remaining net deferred tax asset of $23.4 million. The Company is unable to determine how much, if any of the remaining DTA will be utilized.\nSystem failure or breaches of Carver\u2019s network security could subject it to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure Carver and its third-party service providers use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Carver\u2019s operations are dependent upon its ability to protect its computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in Carver\u2019s operations could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through Carver\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to Carver and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with Carver. Although Carver, with the help of third-party service providers, intends to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures designed to prevent such damage, its security measures may not be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography\nor other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms Carver and its third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on Carver\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is possible that a significant amount of time and money may be spent to rectify the harm caused by a breach or hack. While Carver has general liability insurance, there are limitations on coverage as well as dollar amount. Furthermore, cyber incidents carry a greater risk of injury to Carver\u2019s reputation. Finally, depending on the type of incident, banking regulators can impose restrictions on Carver\u2019s business and consumer laws may require reimbursement of customer loss.\nThe Company's business could suffer if it fails to retain skilled people.\nThe Company's success depends on its ability to attract and retain key employees reflecting current market opportunities and challenges. Competition for the best people is intense, and the Company's size and limited resources may present additional challenges in being able to retain the best possible employees, which could adversely affect the results of operations.", "PERMNO": 80960, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "CARV"}
