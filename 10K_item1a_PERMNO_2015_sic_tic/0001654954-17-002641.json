You should consider the following risk factors, as well as other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report, before deciding to invest in our securities. The following factors affect our business, our intellectual property, the industry in which we operate and our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or which we consider immaterial as of the date hereof may also have an adverse effect on our business. If any of the matters discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected, the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business to date has been almost entirely dependent on the development of Tcelna, which recently failed to show a treatment effect in the Phase IIb clinical trial known as the Abili-T study. We are continuing to assess the viability of our other research and development programs and conduct a review of strategic alternatives, and it is possible that we may ultimately decide not to pursue any further drug development of Tcelna or our other programs. Although we have decreased our cash burn substantially, our cash needs over the next few months may be unpredictable.\nOn October 28, 2016, we announced that the Phase IIb Abili-T clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tcelna (imilecleucel-T) in patients with SPMS did not meet its primary endpoint of reduction in brain volume change (atrophy), nor did it meet the secondary endpoint of reduction of the rate of sustained disease progression. We had previously devoted substantially all of our research, development, clinical efforts and financial resources toward the development of Tcelna. We implemented a reduction in workforce of 40% of our then 20 full-time employees, announced on November 2, 2016, while we reevaluated our programs and various strategic alternatives in light of the disappointing Abili-T study data. On December 14, 2016, a further workforce reduction was implemented to conserve cash, reducing the number of full-time employees by an additional 25% of the then 12 employees. As of December 31, 2016 we had nine full-time employees. On January 31, 2017, an additional workforce reduction of seven full-time employees was implemented to conserve cash. After further analysis of the data from the Abili-T trial, we have determined that we will not move forward with further studies of Tcelna in SPMS at this time. We are conducting a review of our other research and development programs, including our preclinical program for OPX-212 in NMO, to assess the viability of continuing to pursue one or more of these programs. We are also exploring our strategic alternatives. We cannot fully predict whether or to what extent we will resume drug development activities, and we cannot predict our future cash needs until we complete this analysis and while we are evaluating strategic alternatives.\nIf we decide to continue one or more of our development programs, we will be required to raise additional capital, and our ability to obtain funding in light of the disappointing results from the Abili-T study is likely to be challenging. If sufficient capital is not available, we may not be able to continue our operations, which may require us to suspend or terminate any ongoing development activities, modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations, cease operations or seek relief under applicable bankruptcy laws.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 million as well as accounts payable, short-term notes payable and accrued expenses aggregating $1.2 million. Our operating cash burn rate during the 12 months ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $767,000 per month, which was mainly for the completion and wind down of the Phase IIb Abili-T clinical study in SPMS.\nWe believe that we have sufficient liquidity to support our current activities in winding down the Abili-T trial and for general operations to sustain the Company and support such activities into the second quarter of 2017. However, if our projections prove to be inaccurate, or if we encounter additional costs to wind down the trial or to sustain our operations, or if we incur other costs such as those associated with pursuing further research and development, we would need to raise additional capital to continue our operations.\nIf we decide to continue the development of one or more of our programs, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing losses for at least the next several years. We would need to raise additional capital in order to conduct additional clinical trials of Tcelna or any other product candidates. Given the disappointing results of our Abili-T trial, we believe our ability to issue equity securities or obtain debt financing in the future on favorable terms, or at all, has been substantially impaired, particularly if the intended use of proceeds would be for the continued development of Tcelna.\nWe continue to explore potential opportunities and alternatives to obtain the additional resources that will be necessary to support our ongoing operations through and beyond the next 12 months, including raising additional capital through either private or public equity or debt financing as well as using our ATM facility and cutting expenses where possible. However, in light of the Abili-T study results, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funds or, if such funds are available, that the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional funding to support our current activities and operations, we may not be able to continue our operations as proposed, which may require us to suspend or terminate any development activities, modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations, cease operations or seek relief under applicable bankruptcy laws. In such event, our shareholders may lose a substantial portion or even all of their investment.\nIf we are not successful in attracting another partner, we may not be able to complete development of or commercialize any product candidate. In such event, our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability would be significantly hindered and we may not be able to continue operations as proposed, requiring us to modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations or cease operations. In such event, our shareholders may lose a substantial portion or even all of their investment.\nWe do not maintain any external lines of credit or have any sources of debt or equity capital committed for funding, other than our ATM facility. Should we need any additional capital in the future beyond these sources, management will be reliant upon \u201cbest efforts\u201d debt or equity financings. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in any funding effort. The timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to establish, enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing;\n\u25cf\nthe accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for capital needs;\n\u25cf\nscientific progress in our research and development programs;\n\u25cf\nthe magnitude and scope of our research and development programs;\n\u25cf\nour progress with preclinical development and clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims; and\n\u25cf\nthe number and type of product candidates that we pursue.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, shareholders may experience substantial dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impede our ability to operate our business. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our shareholders. There is no assurance that our capital raising efforts will be able to attract the capital needed to execute on our business plan and sustain our operations.\nThere is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern, which may make it more difficult for us to raise capital.\nThe report of our independent auditors in respect of the 2016 fiscal year expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Specifically, it noted our recurring losses, negative operating cash flows and accumulated deficit. Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016 and for the 12-month period then ended were prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, meaning that we will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. While we have historically recognized revenue related to the $5 million and $3 million payments from Merck Serono received in February 2013 and March 2015 in connection with the Option and License Agreement and the Amendment over the exclusive option period based on the expected completion term of the Abili-T clinical trial, we have never generated any commercial revenues, nor do we expect to generate any commercial revenues for the foreseeable future or other revenues in the near term that will result in cash receipts. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 million as well as accounts payable, short-term notes payable and accrued expenses aggregating $1.2 million.\nOn October 28, 2016, we announced that the Abili-T trial did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints, and, in order to conserve cash resources while we reevaluated our programs and explored various strategic alternatives, during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 we implemented several reductions in workforce totaling 90% of our then 20 full-time employees. After further analysis of the data from the Abili-T trial, we have determined that we will not move forward with further studies of Tcelna in SPMS at this time, and we are conducting a review of our other research and development programs. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to support our current activities in winding down the Abili-T trial and for general operations to sustain the Company and support such activities into the second quarter of 2017.\nWe continue to explore potential opportunities and alternatives to obtain the additional resources that will be necessary to support our ongoing operations through and beyond the next 12 months, including raising additional capital through either private or public equity or debt financing as well as using our ATM facility and cutting expenses where possible. In the absence of significant additional funding to support our operations, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nAdditionally, in light of the disappointing Abili-T study results, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funds, or if such funds are available, that the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional funding to support our current activities and operations, we may not be able to continue our operations as proposed, which may require us to suspend or terminate any development activities, modify our business plan, curtail various aspects of our operations, cease operations or seek relief under applicable bankruptcy laws. In such event, our shareholders may lose a substantial portion or even all of their investment.\nWe have a history of operating losses and do not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not generated any profits since our entry into the biotechnology business and we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future. We have not received, and we do not expect to receive for at least the next several years, any revenues from the commercialization of any potential products. We do not currently have any sources of revenues and may not have any in the foreseeable future.\nOur business is at an early stage of development. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development efforts relating to Tcelna.\nOur business is at an early stage of development. We do not have any products on the market. We have only one product candidate, Tcelna, which has progressed to the stage of being studied in human clinical trials in the United States. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development efforts relating to Tcelna, including conducting clinical trials and developing manufacturing capabilities, providing general and administrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual property. The disappointing results of from our Abili-T trial have resulted, at a minimum, in a development delay of at least a few years. If we decide to continue the development of one or more of our programs, we will need to commence and complete additional clinical trials, manage clinical and manufacturing activities, and obtain necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA in the United States and from foreign regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. Additionally, our second pipeline candidate, OPX-212 is currently in preclinical development for the treatment of NMO. Any of our potential products will require regulatory approval prior to marketing in the United States and other countries. Obtaining such approval requires significant research and development and preclinical and clinical testing. We may not be able to develop any products, obtain regulatory approvals, enter clinical trials (or any development activities) for any product candidates, or commercialize any products. Any of our potential products may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects or other characteristics adversely affecting their safety, efficacy or cost-effectiveness that could prevent or limit their use. Any product using any of our technology may fail to provide the intended therapeutic benefits or to achieve therapeutic benefits equal to or better than the standard of treatment at the time of testing or production.\nThe Abili-T trial results cast doubt about the probative value of our results in earlier clinical trials of Tcelna.\nTrial designs and results from previous trials are not necessarily predictive of our future clinical trial designs or results. For example, although the results of prior clinical trials of Tcelna for the treatment of MS included evidence of efficacy, the Abili-T trial for the treatment of patients with SPMS failed to meet either its primary or secondary endpoints.\nThere is a high failure rate for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.\nWe will need regulatory approvals for any product candidate prior to introduction to the market, which will require successful testing in clinical trials. Clinical trials are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, and are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement. Any product candidate may fail to achieve necessary safety and efficacy endpoints during clinical trials in which case we will be unable to generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our products.\nHuman clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous FDA requirements, and must otherwise comply with federal, state and local requirements and policies of the medical institutions where they are conducted. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming. Failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and problems could be encountered that would cause us to be unable to initiate a trial, or to abandon or repeat a clinical trial.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u25cf\nFDA or IRB objection to proposed protocols;\n\u25cf\ndiscussions or disagreement with the FDA over the adequacy of trial design to potentially demonstrate effectiveness, and subsequent design modifications;\n\u25cf\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u25cf\ndetermination of dosing issues, epitope profiles, and related adjustments;\n\u25cf\nlack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u25cf\nproduct quality problems (e.g., sterility or purity);\n\u25cf\nchallenges to patient monitoring, retention and data collection during or after treatment (e.g., patients\u2019 failure to return for follow-up visits or to complete the trial, detection of epitope profiles in subsequent visits, etc.); and\n\u25cf\nfailure of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nIn addition, we or the FDA (based on its authority over clinical studies) may delay a proposed investigation or suspend clinical trials in progress at any time if it appears that the study may pose significant risks to the study participants or other serious deficiencies are identified. Prior to approval of any product candidate, the FDA must determine that the data demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The large majority of drug candidates that begin human clinical trials fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy characteristics.\nFurthermore, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols, or otherwise modify our intended course of clinical development, to reflect these changes. This, too, may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. In light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products, and establishment of risk management programs that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA to clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical trials before completion or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense and a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought.\nEven if regulatory approval is obtained for any product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any potential products, whether directly or through any development arrangement, will be limited by any failure to obtain or limitation on necessary regulatory approvals.\nAs a result of the disappointing data from the Abili-T trial and the reductions in our workforce during 2016 and early 2017, our workforce has been reduced substantially. If we are unable to retain our remaining employees, or rebuild our workforce if we decide to continue one or more of our development programs, our business will be seriously jeopardized. It will be difficult to grow or operate our business with the limited number of employees we currently have.\nOn November 2, 2016, we announced a reduction of 40% of our then full-time workforce of 20 employees as a result of the disappointing data from the Abili-T study. On December 14, 2016, a further workforce reduction was implemented to conserve cash, reducing the number of full-time employees by an additional 25% of the then 12 employees. As of December 31, 2016, we had nine full-time employees. On January 31, 2017, an additional workforce reduction of seven full-time employees was implemented to conserve cash, leaving us at this point with only two full-time employees. Our Chief Development Officer resigned in November 2016 after announcement of the Abili-T trial results and the employment of our Chief Scientific Officer was terminated as part of the January 2017 reduction. We have only one officer remaining, who is our President, Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer.\nOur exploration of strategic alternatives and cash conservation activities may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reductions in workforce and reduced employee morale which may cause our remaining employees to seek alternate employment. In such event, we may be unable on a timely basis to hire suitable replacements to operate our business effectively. The loss of the services of any of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our restructuring initiatives have caused disruption in our business operations, and we may not be able to effectively realize the savings anticipated by any restructuring initiative and reductions-in-force. Additionally, there may be future changes in our workforce, including as a result of changes that may occur in our operations or operating plan, or other reasons or events. There may also be possible changes in the amount of charges and cash payments associated with any workforce reduction, including the possibility that we may incur unanticipated charges or make cash payments that are not contemplated.\nAdditionally, if we ultimately decide to pursue one or more of our development programs, we will need to rebuild our workforce and management team. We may be unable on a timely basis to hire and train suitable new employees to continue to operate our business and further any such development programs. It will be difficult to grow or operate our business with the small number of employees we currently have.\nFunding from our ATM facility may be limited or be insufficient to fund our operations or to implement our strategy.\nWe will need to keep current our shelf registration statement and the offering prospectus relating to ATM facility with Brinson Patrick (now a division of IFS Securities, Inc.) in order to use the program to sell shares of our common stock. The number of shares and price at which we may be able to sell shares under our ATM facility may be limited due to market conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nWe may make changes to discretionary R&D investments that may have an impact on costs.\nWe conducted an immune monitoring program on blood samples collected over time to detect Tcelna-induced immune modulation. While certain data has been analyzed to date, a correlation analysis of immune monitoring T-cell phenotypes to MRTC bio-activity has not been conducted. Expenses associated with the immune monitoring program are incurred at our discretion and are not required to satisfy any FDA-mandated criteria. Consequently, we may make changes to the parameters that are being analyzed, or we may elect not to proceed with certain analyses, and these changes may result in either increased or decreased expenses for the study.\nWe may also incur discretionary expenses related to preclinical, Phase I, Phase II and/or Phase III development programs, manufacturing scale-up/automation and technology transfer, research on additional indications and business development activities. There is no assurance that any such future expenses would be recovered by us.\nWe would need to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis, which may result in costs and delays that may hamper our ability to successfully develop and commercialize any product candidate.\nAlthough we have participated in the design and management of our past clinical trials, we do not have the ability to conduct clinical trials directly for any product candidate. We would need to rely on contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct any clinical trials and to perform data collection and analysis.\nAny clinical trials we may conduct could be delayed, suspended or terminated if:\n\u25cf\nany third party upon whom we rely does not successfully carry out its contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines;\n\u25cf\nlicenses needed from third parties for manufacturing in order to conduct Phase III trials or to conduct commercial manufacturing, if applicable, are not obtained;\n\u25cf\nany such third party needs to be replaced; or\n\u25cf\nthe quality or accuracy of the data obtained by the third party is compromised due to its failure to adhere to clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons.\nFailure to perform by any third party upon whom we rely may increase our development costs, delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and prevent the commercialization of any product candidate. While we believe that there are numerous alternative sources to provide these services, we might not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without delays or additional expenditures if we were to seek such alternative sources.\nIf we fail to identify and license or acquire other product candidates, we will not be able to expand our business over the long term.\nWe have focused on MS as the first disease to be pursued off our T-cell platform technology, and in 2014, we initiated development activities for OPX-212, our drug candidate for NMO, as the second disease we are pursuing. As a platform technology, there exists the potential to address other autoimmune diseases with the technology. While preclinical development and manufacturing activities have been conducted for OPX-212 in NMO, such work is modest compared to the effort that has been committed to Tcelna for the lead MS indication. However, inasmuch as the Abili-T study of Tcelna in SPMS did not meet either its primary or secondary endpoints, we have determined that we will not move forward with further studies of Tcelna in SPMS at this time and are assessing whether to continue our development activities. Our business over the long term is substantially dependent on our ability to develop, license or acquire product candidates and further develop them for commercialization. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to expand our existing platform or identify, select and acquire the right product candidates. We have limited experience identifying, negotiating and implementing economically viable product candidate acquisitions or licenses, which is a lengthy and complex process. Also, the market for licensing and acquiring product candidates is intensely competitive, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do. We may not have the requisite capital resources to consummate product candidate acquisitions or licenses that we identify to fulfill our strategy.\nMoreover, any product candidate acquisition that we do complete will involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in integrating the development program for the acquired product candidate into our existing operations;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u25cf\nrisks of entering new potential markets or technologies;\n\u25cf\ninability to generate sufficient funding to offset acquisition costs; and\n\u25cf\ndelays that may result from our having to perform unanticipated preclinical trials or other tests on the product candidate.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under our license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends.\nOur business depends on licenses from third parties. These third party license agreements impose obligations on us, such as payment obligations and obligations diligently to pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents. If applicable, we may also need to seek additional licenses to move into Phase III trials or the commercial stage of operations. These licenses may require increased payments to the licensors. If a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement, the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights, which could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation and, potentially, a loss of the licensed rights. During the period of any such litigation, our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential products could be significantly and negatively affected. If our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost, our ability to continue our business based on the affected technology platform could be adversely affected.\nWe no longer lease a research and manufacturing facility in which to conduct development or manufacture product candidates for our programs or clinical trial activities or, if any such clinical trials were to be successful, commercial applications.\nThrough January 2017, we conducted our research and development in a 10,200 square foot facility in The Woodlands, Texas, which included an approximately 1,200 square foot suite of three rooms for the manufacture of T-cell therapies. On February 1, 2017, we assigned the facility lease to a third party, who assumed from us all of our remaining rights and obligations under the lease. In connection with the lease assignment, we also sold certain furniture, fixtures and equipment (including laboratory and manufacturing equipment) as well as our laboratory supplies located at our corporate headquarters to the third party for cash consideration. In light of the continuing evaluation of our strategic alternatives following the release of data from the Abili-T clinical study, we deemed it advisable to reduce our office, R&D and manufacturing space and corresponding rent obligations. As a result, we are currently using temporary office space in the same facility but no longer have the capacity for any research and development or for any manufacturing operations. If we decide to continue to pursue development of any of our product candidates, we would need to locate and obtain a new facility, arrange for R&D and manufacturing staff, contract with corporate collaborators or other third parties to assist with future drug production and commercialization, or defer to a collaborative partner or third party to address these needs.\nIn the event that we decide to again establish a R&D or manufacturing facility, we would require substantial additional funds and would be required to hire and train significant numbers of employees and comply with applicable regulations, which are extensive. We do not have funds available for building an R&D or manufacturing facility, and we may not be able to build a facility that both meets regulatory requirements and is sufficient for our needs.\nWe may arrange with third parties for the manufacture of our future products, if any. However, our third-party sourcing strategy may not result in a cost-effective means for manufacturing our future products. If we employ third-party manufacturers, we will not control many aspects of the manufacturing process, including compliance by these third parties with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. We further may not be able to obtain adequate supplies from third-party manufacturers in a timely fashion for development or commercialization purposes, and commercial quantities of products may not be available from contract manufacturers at acceptable costs.\nProblems with our manufacturing process or with a manufacturing facility (whether ours or a third party\u2019s) could result in the failure to produce, or a delay in producing, adequate supplies of any of our product candidates. A number of factors could cause interruptions or delays, including equipment malfunctions or failures, destruction or damage to a manufacturing facility due to natural disasters or otherwise, contamination of materials, changes in regulatory requirements or standards that require modifications to our manufacturing process, action by a regulatory agency or by a manufacturer (whether us or a third party) that results in the halting or slowdown of production due to regulatory issues, any third-party manufacturer going out of business or failing to produce as contractually required, or other similar factors.\nDifficulties, delays or interruptions in the manufacture and supply of any of our product candidates could require us to stop treating patients in our clinical development of such product candidate and/or require a halt to or suspension of, or otherwise adversely affect, a clinical trial, thus increasing our costs and damaging our reputation. If a product candidate is approved, difficulties, delays or interruptions in the manufacture and supply of such product candidate could cause a delay in or even halt or suspend the commercialization of such product candidate, potentially causing a partial or complete loss of revenue or market share.\nTcelna was manufactured using our proprietary ImmPath\u00ae technology for the production of an autologous T-cell immunotherapy utilizing a patient\u2019s own blood. Our manufacturing process may raise development issues that may not be resolvable, regulatory issues that could delay or prevent approval, or personnel issues that may prevent the further development or commercialization, if approved, of any product candidate.\nTcelna was based on our novel T-cell immunotherapy platform, ImmPath, which produces an autologous T-cell immunotherapy utilizing a patient\u2019s own blood. OPX-212 may be similarly produced. The manufacture of living T-cell products requires specialized facilities, equipment and personnel which are different than the resources required for manufacturing chemical or biologic compounds. Scaling-out the manufacture of living cell products to meet demands for commercialization will require substantial amounts of such specialized facilities, equipment and personnel, especially where the products are personalized and must be made for each patient individually. Because our manufacturing processes are complex, require facilities and personnel that are not widely available in the industry, involve equipment and training with long lead times, and the establishment of new manufacturing facilities is subject to a potentially lengthy regulatory approval process, alternative qualified production capacity may not be available on a timely basis or on reasonably terms, if at all. In addition, not many consultants or advisors in the industry have relevant experience and can provide guidance or assistance because active immune therapies are fundamentally a new category of product in two major ways: (i) the product consists of living T-cells, not chemical or biologic compounds; and (ii) the product is personalized. There can be no assurance that manufacturing problems will not arise in the future which we may not be able to resolve or which may cause significant delays in development or, if any product candidate is approved, commercialization.\nRegulatory approval of product candidates that are manufactured using novel manufacturing processes such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical products, due to a lack of experience with them. FDA approval of personalized immunotherapy products has been limited to date. This lack of experience and precedent may lengthen the regulatory review process, require that additional studies or clinical trials be conducted, increase development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization, or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions.\nIn addition, the novel nature of product candidates also means that fewer people are trained in or experienced with product candidates of this type, which may make it difficult to find, hire and retain capable personnel for research, development and manufacturing positions.\nIf any product we may eventually have is not accepted by the market or if users of any such product are unable to obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for such product from government and other third-party payors, our revenues and profitability will suffer.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize any product we may eventually have, to the extent applicable, and/or our ability to receive any revenue will depend in significant part on the extent to which appropriate coverage of and reimbursement for such product and any related treatments are obtained from governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations, or HMOs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party payors will consider any product cost-effective or provide coverage of and reimbursement for such product, in whole or in part.\nUncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved medical products and services and newly approved indications for existing products. Third-party payors may conclude that any product is less safe, less clinically effective, or less cost-effective than existing products, and third-party payors may not approve such product for coverage and reimbursement. If adequate coverage of and reimbursement for any product from third-party payors cannot be obtained, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them. Such reduction or limitation in the use of any such product would cause sales to suffer. Even if third-party payors make reimbursement available, payment levels may not be sufficient to make the sale of any such product profitable.\nIn addition, the trend towards managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the purchase of medical services and products, may result in inadequate coverage of and reimbursement for any product we may eventually have. Many third-party payors, including in particular HMOs, are pursuing various ways to reduce pharmaceutical costs, including, for instance, the use of formularies. The market for any product depends on access to such formularies, which are lists of medications for which third-party payors provide reimbursement. These formularies are increasingly restricted, and pharmaceutical companies face significant competition in their efforts to place their products on formularies of HMOs and other third-party payors. This increased competition has led to a downward pricing pressure in the industry. The cost containment measures that third-party payors are instituting could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate profitably.\nAny product candidate, if approved for sale, may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenues.\nEven if a product candidate is approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate by physicians, healthcare professionals and third-party payors, and our profitability and growth, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ndemonstration of efficacy;\n\u25cf\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\navailability and cost of alternative treatments, including cheaper generic drugs;\n\u25cf\npricing and cost effectiveness, which may be subject to regulatory control;\n\u25cf\neffectiveness of sales and marketing strategies for the product and competition for such product;\n\u25cf\nthe product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries; and\n\u25cf\nthe availability of adequate third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement.\nIf any product candidate does not provide a treatment regimen that is as beneficial as the current standard of care or otherwise does not provide patient benefit, that product candidate, if approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, likely will not achieve market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from that product candidate would be substantially reduced.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs and risks as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, as well as rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ). Changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of SOX and rules adopted by the SEC and by NASDAQ, have resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. Given the risks inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting is uncertain. If our internal controls are not designed or operating effectively, we may not be able to conclude an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as required or we or our independent registered public accounting firm may determine that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. We currently have a very limited workforce, and it may be difficult to adhere to appropriate internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls with such limited staffing. In addition, our registered public accounting firm may either disclaim an opinion as it relates to management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls or may issue an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, especially in light of the fact that we currently have a very limited workforce. Investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and which could affect our ability to run our business as we otherwise would like to. New rules could also make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the coverage that is the same or similar to our current coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our Board committees and as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the total amount of the costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with these rules and regulations.\nUnder the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ, a majority of our Board of Directors and each member of our Audit and Compensation Committees must be an independent director. If any vacancies on our Board or our Audit or Compensation Committees occur that need to be filled by independent directors, we may encounter difficulty in attracting qualified persons to serve on our Board and, in particular, our Audit Committee. If we fail to attract and retain the required number of independent directors, we may be subject to SEC enforcement proceedings and delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAny acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe expect to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies on a global geographic footprint. We may also consider joint ventures, licensing and other collaborative projects. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or strategic partners, or successfully negotiate, finance or integrate acquisitions of any businesses, products or technologies. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition and management of any collaborative project may divert our management\u2019s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We do not have any experience with acquiring companies, or with acquiring products outside of the United States. Any cash acquisition we pursue would potentially divert the cash we have on our balance sheet from our present clinical development programs. Any stock acquisitions would dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership. While we from time to time evaluate potential collaborative projects and acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we have no present agreements with respect to any acquisitions or collaborative projects.\nWe plan to do business internationally, which may prove to be difficult and fraught with economic, regulatory and political issues.\nWe may acquire or in-license foreign companies or technologies or commercialize our T-cell or stem cell platform in countries where the business, economic and political climates are very different from those of the United States. We may not be aware of some of these issues and it may be difficult for a U.S. company to overcome these issues and ultimately become profitable. Certain foreign countries may favor businesses that are owned by nationals of those countries as opposed to foreign-owned business operating locally. As a small company, we may not have the resources to engage in the negotiation and time-consuming work needed to overcome some of these potential issues.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nPatents obtained by other persons may result in infringement claims against us that are costly to defend and which may limit our ability to use the disputed technologies and prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of potential products, such as Tcelna.\nIf third party patents or patent applications contain claims infringed by either our licensed technology or other technology required to make or use our potential products, such as Tcelna, and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost, if at all, or be able to develop or obtain alternative technology. If we are unable to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, we may not be able to develop any affected product candidate commercially. There can be no assurance that we will not be obliged to defend ourselves in court against allegations of infringement of third party patents. Patent litigation is very expensive and could consume substantial resources and create significant uncertainties. An adverse outcome in such a suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties, or require us to cease using such technology.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent protection and other proprietary rights, our operations will be significantly harmed.\nOur ability to compete effectively is dependent upon obtaining patent protection relating to our technologies. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, are uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. The coverage sought in a patent application can be denied or significantly reduced before or after the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether pending patent applications for our technology will result in the issuance of patents, or if any issued patents will provide significant protection or commercial advantage or will be circumvented by others. Since patent applications are secret until the applications are published (usually 18 months after the earliest effective filing date), and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that the inventors of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights were the first to make the inventions at issue or that any patent applications at issue were the first to be filed for such inventions. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from pending patent applications or, if issued, that such patents will be of commercial benefit to us, afford us adequate protection from competing products, or not be challenged or declared invalid.\nIssued U.S. patents require the payment of maintenance fees to continue to be in force. We rely on a third party payor to do this and their failure to do so could result in the forfeiture of patents not timely maintained. Many foreign patent offices also require the payment of periodic annuities to keep patents and patent applications in good standing. As we may not maintain direct control over the payment of all such annuities, we cannot assure you that our third party payor will timely pay such annuities and that the granted patents and pending patent applications will not become abandoned. In addition, we or our licensors may have selected a limited amount of foreign patent protection, and therefore applications have not been filed in, and foreign patents may not have been perfected in, all commercially significant countries.\nThe patent protection of product candidates, such as Tcelna, involves complex legal and factual questions. To the extent that it would be necessary or advantageous for any of our licensors to cooperate or lead in the enforcement of our licensed intellectual property rights, we cannot control the amount or timing of resources such licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on enforcing such rights. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights against third party infringement, which may be difficult to detect. Additionally, challenges may be made to the ownership of our intellectual property rights, our ability to enforce them, or our underlying licenses.\nWe cannot be certain that any of the patents issued to us or to our licensors will provide adequate protection from competing products. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we or our licensors can:\n\u25cf\nobtain and maintain patents to protect our product candidates such as Tcelna;\n\u25cf\nobtain and maintain any required or desirable licenses to use certain technologies of third parties, which may be protected by patents;\n\u25cf\nprotect our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u25cf\noperate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others;\n\u25cf\nenforce the issued patents under which we hold rights; and\n\u25cf\ndevelop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights (owned or licensed) is uncertain. For example:\n\u25cf\nwe or our licensor might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or issued patents owned by, or licensed to, us;\n\u25cf\nwe or our licensor might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of the technologies owned by, or licensed to, us;\n\u25cf\nit is possible that none of the pending patent applications owned by, or licensed to, us will result in issued patents;\n\u25cf\nany patents under which we hold rights may not provide us with a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties as invalid, or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws; or\n\u25cf\nany of the issued patents under which we hold rights may not be valid or enforceable or may be circumvented successfully in light of the continuing evolution of domestic and foreign patent laws.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete.\nWe rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Further, we have limited control, if any, over the protection of trade secrets developed by our licensors. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nA dispute concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and costly, and an unfavorable outcome could harm our business.\nA number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies, universities and research institutions have filed patent applications or have been issued patents relating to cell therapy, T-cells, and other technologies potentially relevant to or required by our product candidates such as Tcelna. We cannot predict which, if any, of such applications will issue as patents or the claims that might be allowed. We are aware of a number of patent applications and patents claiming use of modified cells to treat disease, disorder or injury.\nThere is significant litigation in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. While we are not currently subject to any pending intellectual property litigation, and are not aware of any such threatened litigation, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates, such as Tcelna, or their methods of use, manufacturing or other technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties. If our product candidates, such as Tcelna, or their methods of manufacture are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses under such patents. We have not conducted comprehensive searches of patents issued to third parties relating to Tcelna or OPX-212. Consequently, no assurance can be given that third-party patents containing claims covering Tcelna or OPX-212, their methods of use or manufacture do not exist or have not been filed and will not be issued in the future. Because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, and because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications that will mature into issued patents that relate to our current or future product candidates that could have a material effect in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates. A patent holder could prevent us from importing, making, using or selling the patented compounds. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Similarly, we may be subject to claims that we have inappropriately used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of third parties. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win or lose. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. We may not be able to afford the costs of litigation. Any legal action against us or our collaborators could lead to:\n\u25cf\npayment of actual damages, royalties, lost profits, potentially treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent rights;\n\u25cf\ninjunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell our products;\n\u25cf\nwe or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all; or\n\u25cf\nsignificant cost and expense, as well as distraction of our management from our business.\nAs a result, we could be prevented from commercializing current or future product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe are subject to stringent regulation of our product candidates, which could delay development and commercialization.\nWe, our third-party contractors and suppliers, and our product candidates are subject to stringent regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. None of our product candidates can be marketed in the United States until it has been approved by the FDA. No product candidate of ours has been approved, and we may never receive FDA approval for any product candidate. Obtaining FDA approval typically takes many years and requires substantial resources. Even if regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use and labeling of such products. Additionally, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. These regulatory requirements may limit the size of the market for the product or result in the incurrence of additional costs. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could substantially reduce our ability to generate revenues.\nIn addition, both before and after regulatory approval, we and our product candidates are subject to numerous FDA requirements covering, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution and export. The FDA\u2019s requirements may change and additional government regulations may be promulgated that could affect us and our product candidates. Given the number of recent high profile adverse safety events with certain drug products, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, costly risk management programs, which may include safety surveillance, restricted distribution and use, patient education, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, preapproval of promotional materials and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising. Furthermore, heightened Congressional scrutiny on the adequacy of the FDA\u2019s drug approval process and the agency\u2019s efforts to assure the safety of marketed drugs resulted in the enactment of legislation addressing drug safety issues, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007. This legislation provides the FDA with expanded authority over drug products after approval and the FDA\u2019s exercise of this authority could result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development, clinical trials and regulatory review and approval, and increased costs to assure compliance with new post-approval regulatory requirements. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from this or future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.\nIn order to market any of our products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods and the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States. Approval by the FDA does not automatically lead to the approval of authorities outside of the United States and, similarly, approval by other regulatory authorities outside the United States will not automatically lead to FDA approval. In addition, regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Our product candidates may not be approved for all indications that we request, which would limit uses and adversely impact our potential royalties and product sales. Such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which any potential product may be marketed or require costly, post-marketing follow-up studies.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States and other countries, among other things, we may be subject to fines and other civil penalties, delays in approving or failure to approve a product, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, interruption of manufacturing or clinical trials, injunctions and criminal prosecution, any of which would harm our business.\nWe may need to change our business practices to comply with health care fraud and abuse regulations, and our failure to comply with such laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are successful in achieving approval to market one or more of our product candidates, our operations will be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, or OIG, to issue a series of regulations, known as the \u201csafe harbors.\u201d These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, sometimes known as \u201crelators\u201d or, more commonly, as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claims Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.\nIn addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.\nBeginning August 1, 2013, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the \u201cSunshine Act\u201d), which is part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals or medical supplies that participate in U.S. federal health care programs to track and then report certain payments and items of value given to U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals (defined as \u201cCovered Recipients\u201d). The Sunshine Act requires that manufacturers collect this information on a yearly basis and then report it to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by the 90th day of each subsequent year.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nIf our competitors develop and market products that are more effective than our product candidates, they may reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunities.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly the market for MS products, is intense, and we expect such competition to continue to increase. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, in the United States and abroad. Our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development and may succeed in developing drugs that are more effective, safer and more affordable or more easily administered than ours, or that achieve patent protection or commercialization sooner than our products. Our most significant competitors are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology companies. These companies have significantly greater capital resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing than we currently do. However, smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaboration arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. In addition to the competitors with existing products that have been approved, many of our competitors are further along in the process of product development and also operate large, company-funded research and development programs. As a result, our competitors may develop more competitive or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or further product commercialization than we are able to achieve. Competitive products may render any products or product candidates that we develop obsolete.\nOur competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any products that we may develop.\nRapid technological change could make our products obsolete.\nBiopharmaceutical technologies have undergone rapid and significant change, and we expect that they will continue to do so. As a result, there is significant risk that our product candidates may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by new discoveries before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with their development. If our product candidates are rendered obsolete by advancements in biopharmaceutical technologies, our future prospects will suffer.\nConsumers may sue us for product liability, which could result in substantial liabilities that exceed our available resources and damage our reputation.\nDeveloping and commercializing drug products entails significant product liability risks. Liability claims may arise from our and our collaborators\u2019 use of products in clinical trials and the commercial sale of those products.\nIn the event that any of our product candidates becomes an approved product and is commercialized, consumers may make product liability claims directly against us and/or our partners, and our partners or others selling these products may seek contribution from us if they incur any loss or expenses related to such claims. We have insurance that covers clinical trial activities. We believe our insurance coverage as of the date hereof is reasonably adequate at this time. However, we will need to increase and expand this coverage as we commence additional clinical trials, as well as larger scale trials, and if any product candidate is approved for commercial sale. This insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Our inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the regulatory approval or commercialization of products that we or one of our collaborators develop. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Liability from such claims could exceed our total assets if we do not prevail in any lawsuit brought by a third party alleging that an injury was caused by one or more of our products.\nGovernment controls and health care reform measures could adversely affect our business.\nThe business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care. In the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the health care system. For example, in some foreign countries, particularly in Europe, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of any product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of any product candidate is unavailable or limited in scope or amount in a particular country, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability in such country. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. Any negotiated prices for any product candidate covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices that might otherwise be obtained outside of the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Moreover, while Medicare Part D applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment under Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.\nThe United States and several other jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell any product candidate. Among policy-makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect: the demand for any product candidate; the ability to set a price that we believe is fair for any product candidate; our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and the availability of capital.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThere is currently a limited market for our securities, and any trading market that exists in our securities may be highly illiquid and may not reflect the underlying value of our net assets or business prospects.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market, there is currently a limited market for our securities and there can be no assurance that an active market will ever develop. Investors are cautioned not to rely on the possibility that an active trading market may develop.\nOur stock may be delisted from NASDAQ, which could affect its market price and liquidity.\nWe are required to meet certain qualitative and financial tests (including a minimum bid price for our common stock of $1.00 per share and a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million), as well as certain corporate governance standards, to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. In the past we have received staff deficiency letters from NASDAQ but we are currently compliant with NASDAQ listing requirements.\nWhile we are exercising diligent efforts to maintain the listing of our common stock on NASDAQ, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price, stockholder\u2019s equity or other listing standards in the future. For example, as a consequence of our announcement on October 28, 2016 that the Abili-T trial did not meet either its primary or secondary endpoints, our stock has traded below $1.00 per share at times. If our stock price does not increase in the future, we may receive a notice from NASDAQ that we have failed to meet its requirements, and proceedings to delist our stock could be commenced. In such event, NASDAQ rules permit us to appeal any delisting determination to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel. If we are unable to maintain or regain compliance in a timely manner and our common stock is delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell our common stock and obtain accurate quotations, and the price of our stock could suffer a material decline. Delisting may also impair our ability to raise capital.\nOur share price is volatile, and you may not be able to resell our shares at a profit or at all.\nThe market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and early-stage drug discovery and development companies like us in particular, have historically been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf\nthe disappointing results recently announced on October 28, 2016 for the Abili-T clinical study of Tcelna in SPMS;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of significant changes in our business or operations, including the decision not to pursue one or more of our drug development programs or the decision to implement restructurings such as reductions in our workforce;\n\u25cf\nthe development status of any drug candidates, such as Tcelna, including clinical study results and determinations by regulatory authorities with respect thereto;\n\u25cf\nthe initiation, termination or reduction in the scope of any collaboration arrangements or any disputes or developments regarding such collaborations;\n\u25cf\nour inability to obtain additional funding;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations, new commercial products or other material events by our competitors or us;\n\u25cf\ndisputes or other developments concerning our proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nchanges in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations of our financial performance;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\ndiscussions of our business, products, financial performance, prospects or stock price by the financial and scientific press and online investor communities;\n\u25cf\npublic concern as to, and legislative action with respect to, the pricing and availability of prescription drugs or the safety of drugs and drug delivery techniques;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the United States and in foreign countries; or\n\u25cf\ndilutive effects of sales of shares of common stock by us or our shareholders, and sales of common stock acquired upon exercise or conversion by the holders of warrants, options or convertible notes.\nBroad market and industry factors, as well as economic and political factors, also may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be or become the target of securities litigation, which is costly and time-consuming to defend.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility in the price of a company\u2019s securities or the reporting of unfavorable news, security holders have often instituted class action litigation. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. Moreover, following the announcement on October 28, 2016 of disappointing results for the Abili-T study, our stock price decreased substantially, which may portend securities class action litigation against us. If we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, causing our business to suffer.\nOur \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock could be issued to prevent a business combination not desired by management or our majority shareholders.\nOur charter authorizes the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined by our Board of Directors without shareholder approval. Our preferred stock could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in our control and as a method of preventing shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares in connection with a change of control.\nFuture sales of our securities could cause dilution, and the sale of such securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our stock to fall.\nOn March 25, 2016, we entered into a new Sales Agreement with IFS Securities, Inc. (doing business as Brinson Patrick, a division of IFS Securities, Inc.) as sales agent, pursuant to which we can offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time depending upon market demand, in transactions deemed to be an \u201cat the market\u201d offering. We registered up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock for potential sale under the new ATM facility. From August 17, 2016 through December 31, 2016, we sold an aggregate of 66,184 shares of our common stock under our ATM facility. We generated gross and net proceeds, including amortization of deferred offering costs, of $293,345 and $276,912, respectively, with the average share price ranging from $4.12 to $4.73 per share. During January 2017, we further sold an aggregate of 516,278 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $490,098, with the average share price ranging from $0.90 to $0.97. We will need to keep current our shelf registration statement and the offering prospectus relating to the ATM facility in order to use the program to sell shares of common stock in the future.\nSales of additional shares of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, could result in substantial dilution to our shareholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. An aggregate of 7,141,054 shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2016. As of such date, another (i) 481,947 shares of common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and (ii) 3,596,625 shares of common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants. A substantial majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock and warrants (as well as a substantial majority of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants) are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, in subsequent public or private offerings. We may also issue additional shares of common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, to finance future acquisitions. We may need to raise additional capital in order to initiate or complete additional development activities for Tcelna in MS and for OPX-212 in NMO, or to pursue additional disease indications for our T-cell technology, and this may require us to issue a substantial amount of securities (including common stock as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock). There can be no assurance that our capital raising efforts will be able to attract the capital needed to execute on our business plan and sustain our operations. Moreover, we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our securities will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, as well as securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or securing funds to complete our clinical trial plans, or the perception that such sales could occur, may result in substantial dilution and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe presently do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently anticipate that no cash dividends will be paid on the common stock in the foreseeable future. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, it is anticipated that all earnings, if any, will be retained to finance the future expansion of our business.\nOur shareholders may experience substantial dilution in the value of their investment if we issue additional shares of our capital stock.\nOur charter allows us to issue up to 150,000,000 shares of our common stock and to issue and designate the rights of, without shareholder approval, up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share paid by other investors, and dilution to our shareholders could result. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by investors, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by other investors.\nWe may issue debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, guarantees, preferred stock, hybrid securities, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive distributions of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings may be influenced by market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings or debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future.\nOur management has significant flexibility in using our current available cash.\nIn addition to general corporate purposes (including working capital, research and development, business development and operational purposes), we currently intend to use our available cash to continue to assess the viability of pursuing one or more of our research and development programs, including our preclinical program for OPX-212 in NMO, and to explore our strategic alternatives. We cannot fully predict our future cash needs until we complete this analysis. However, after further analysis of the data from the Abili-T trial, we have determined that we will not move forward with further studies of Tcelna in SPMS at this time.\nDepending on future developments and circumstances, we may use some of our available cash for other purposes which may have the potential to decrease our cash runway. Notwithstanding our current intentions regarding use of our available cash, our management will have significant flexibility with respect to such use. The actual amounts and timing of expenditures will vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of cash used in our operations and our research and development efforts. Management\u2019s failure to use these funds effectively would have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock and could make it more difficult and costly to raise funds in the future.\nAn active trading market may never develop for our Series M warrants, which may limit the ability to resell the warrants.\nThere is no established trading market for the Series M warrants we issued in April 2015. While the warrants have been listed for trading on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cOPXAW,\u201d there can be no assurance that that a market will develop for the warrants. Even if a market for the warrants does develop, the price of the warrants may fluctuate and liquidity may be limited. If a market for the warrants does not develop, then holders of the warrants may be unable to resell the warrants or be able to sell them only at an unfavorable price. Future trading prices of the warrants will depend on many factors, including our operating performance and financial condition, our ability to continue the effectiveness of the registration statement covering the warrants and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, the interest of securities dealers in making a market and the market for similar securities.\nThe market price of our common stock may not exceed the exercise price of the Series M warrants.\nThe Series M warrants issued in April 2015 will expire on April 9, 2018. The warrants entitle the holders to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of $12.00 per share through their expiration. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will exceed the exercise price of the warrants at any or all times prior to their expiration. Any warrants not exercised by their expiration date will expire worthless and we will be under no further obligation to the warrant holder.\nThe Series M warrants may be redeemed on short notice. This may have an adverse impact on their price.\nWe may redeem the Series M warrants for $0.01 per warrant if the closing price of our common stock has equaled or exceeded $20.00 per share, subject to adjustment, for 10 consecutive trading days. If we give notice of redemption, holders will be forced to sell or exercise their warrants or accept the redemption price. The notice of redemption could come at a time when it is not advisable or possible to exercise the warrants. As a result, holders would be unable to benefit from owning the warrants being redeemed.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryovers to reduce future tax payments may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) for federal income tax purposes of approximately $74 million. These NOLs are generally carried forward to reduce taxable income in future years. If unused, the NOLs will begin to expire December 31, 2024. However, our ability to utilize the NOLs is subject to the rules under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue code.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carryforwards. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of our stock on the date of the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOL carryforwards.\nThe rules of Section 382 are complex and subject to varying interpretations. As a result of our numerous capital raises, which have included the issuance of various classes of convertible securities and warrants, uncertainty exists as to whether we may have undergone an ownership change in the past. Based on our recent stock prices, we believe any ownership change would severely limit our ability to utilize the NOLs. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOL carryforward amounts could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOL carryforward amounts to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the expected benefit to us. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOL carryforward amounts before they expire. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the benefits from our NOL carryforward amounts. Presently, impairment tests have not been conducted to verify NOL preservation. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our NOLs will be fully available.\nThe employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer may require us to pay severance benefits if he is terminated under specified circumstances, including in connection with a change of control of us, which could harm our financial condition or results.\nThe employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer contains change of control and severance provisions providing for the payment of severance and other benefits, including accelerated vesting of stock options, in the event of a termination of employment under specified circumstances, including in connection with a change of control of us. The accelerated vesting of options could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and harm the market price of our common stock. The payment of severance benefits could harm our financial condition and results of operation. In addition, these potential severance payments and benefits may discourage or prevent third parties from seeking a business combination with us.", "PERMNO": 91471, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ACER"}
