RISK FACTORS.\nOur business and its future performance may be affected by various factors, the most significant of which are discussed below.\nWe are a clinical-stage drug company, have no prescription drug products approved for commercial sale, have incurred substantial losses, and expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical-stage drug company that has no prescription drug products approved for commercial sale. We have never generated any substantial revenues and may never achieve substantial revenues or profitability. As of December 31, 2018, we have incurred net losses of approximately $227 million in the aggregate since inception in January 2002. We expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or maintain profitability, even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our prescription drug candidates. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating expenditures and anticipate that our operating and capital expenses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and seek regulatory approval for our prescription drug candidates PV-10 and PH-10, implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, and hire additional personnel.\nWe also expect to experience negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and any future capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our common stock.\nWe need additional capital to conduct our operations and commercialize and/or further develop our prescription drug candidates in 2019 and beyond, and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain.\nWe need additional capital in 2019 and beyond as we continue to develop and seek commercialization of our investigational drug product candidates. We intend to continue with the development of PH-10 on the basis of our expanding Phase 2 psoriasis and atopic dermatitis results.\nWe have based our estimate of capital needs on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we cannot assure you that estimates and assumptions will remain unchanged. On March 19, 2017, we entered into an exclusive Definitive Financing Commitment Term Sheet with a group of our stockholders, which was amended and restated effective as of March 19, 2017 (the Term Sheet), which sets forth the terms on which such investors will use their best efforts to provide financing to the Company in the minimum amount of $10 million up to $20 million (the 2017 Financing). As of December 31, 2018, we have raised $13,932,000 through the 2017 Financing. We intend to acquire additional funding through the 2017 Financing, and we may also seek capital from public or private equity or debt financings or other financing sources that may be available.\nSuch additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. As discussed in more detail below, additional equity financing could result in significant dilution to stockholders. Further, in the event that additional funds are obtained through licensing or other arrangements, these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our products, product candidates, and technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize ourselves. If sufficient capital is not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and may impair the value of our patents and other intangible assets.\nThe 2017 Financing is in the form of a secured convertible loans (the Loan) from the PRH Group or other investors in the 2017 Financing (the Investors). The Loan is evidenced by secured convertible promissory notes (individually a PRH Note and collectively, the PRH Notes) from the Company to the PRH Group or the Investors. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the Company entered into PRH Notes with non-related party accredited investors in the aggregate principal amount of $3,475,000 in connection with Loans received by the Company for the same amount.\nThere is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur cash and cash equivalents were $50,986 at December 31, 2018, compared with $105,504 at December 31, 2017. We continue to incur significant operating losses, and management expects that significant on-going operating expenditures will be necessary to successfully implement our business plan and develop and market our products. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date that the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are issued. Implementation of our plans and our ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon our ability to develop PV-10 and PH-10, and to raise additional capital.\nManagement believes that we have access to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, including the 2017 Financing, exchange offers, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will not be able to pay our obligations as they become due.\nOur investigational drug product candidates are at an early to late stage of development and may never obtain U.S. or international regulatory approvals required for us to commercialize our investigational drug product candidates.\nWe will need approval of the FDA to commercialize our investigational drug product candidates in the U.S. and approvals from FDA-equivalent regulatory authorities in international jurisdictions to commercialize our investigational drug product candidates there.\nWe are continuing to pursue clinical development of our most advanced investigational drug product candidates, PV-10 and PH-10, for use as treatments for specific conditions. The continued and further development of these investigational drug product candidates will require significant additional research, formulation and manufacturing development, and pre-clinical and extensive clinical testing prior to their regulatory approval and commercialization. Pre-clinical and clinical studies of our investigational drug product candidates may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after experiencing promising results in earlier trials. Pharmaceutical products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market or be marketed successfully for a number of reasons, including a product may be found to be ineffective or have harmful side effects during subsequent pre-clinical testing or clinical trials, a product may fail to receive necessary regulatory clearance, a product may be too difficult to manufacture on a large scale, a product may be too expensive to manufacture or market, a product may not achieve broad market acceptance, others may hold proprietary rights that will prevent a product from being marketed, and others may market equivalent or superior products.\nSatisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional nonclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive revenues from, our prescription drug candidates, impose costly procedures on us, and diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy.\nOur research and product development efforts may not be successfully completed and may not result in any successfully commercialized drug products. Further, after commercial introduction of a new drug product, discovery of problems through adverse event reporting could result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal from the market and, in certain cases, civil or criminal penalties.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, we cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory clearance for any of our investigational drug product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our prescription drug candidates will severely undermine our business by reducing our number of salable drug products and, therefore, corresponding revenues.\nIn international jurisdictions, we must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize our prescription drug candidates. International regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above.\nWe must conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our investigational drug candidates, including PV-10 and PH-10, in order to obtain regulatory approval of our drug product candidates, which clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and are uncertain as to timing and outcome.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our investigational drug product candidates, including PV-10 and PH-10, we must conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to timing and outcome. Competition in clinical development has made it difficult to enroll patients at an acceptable rate in some of our clinical trials. Advances in medical technology could make our prescription drug candidates obsolete prior to completion of clinical testing. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials may occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products.\nWe are conducting (i) a Phase 1 trial of single-agent PV-10 and combination PV-10 therapy for HCC and other solid tumors metastatic to the liver, (ii) a Phase 1 trial of PV-10 for symptomatic NETs metastatic to the liver, (iii) a Phase 1b/2 combination therapy study of PV-10 and checkpoint inhibition for locally advanced and widely metastatic melanoma. We have placed an enrollment hold on our Phase 3 clinical trial of PV-10 versus investigator\u2019s choice of standard therapy in patients for melanoma confined to cutaneous and subcutaneous sites. We have completed (i) a Phase 1 clinical study of PV-10 for recurrent breast cancer, (ii) a Phase 1 trial of PV-10 in an investigator-initiated study to elucidate the adaptive immune response from injection of melanoma tumors, which led to publication of data in 2016, (iii) immunologic profiling of clinical samples obtained in a Phase 2 clinical trial for mechanism of action of PH-10 for psoriasis, and (iv) multiple Phase 2 clinical trials of PH-10 for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. While we have experience with earlier phase clinical development, we have never completed a Phase 3 clinical trial. The positive results we have seen to date in our Phase 2 clinical trials of PV-10 for metastatic melanoma and out Phase 1 clinical trials of HCC and other solid tumors metastatic to the liver do not ensure that later phase clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. The positive results we have seen to date in our Phase 2 clinical trials of PH-10 for inflammatory dermatoses do not ensure that later phase clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy characteristics despite having progressed satisfactorily through pre-clinical studies and initial clinical testing. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 clinical development, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities to expand our clinical trials of our product candidates in existing indications and undertake additional clinical trials of our product candidates in other indications. Because successful development of our investigational drug product candidates is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds required to complete research and development and commercialize our products under development.\nNegative or inconclusive results of our future clinical trials of PV-10 and PH-10, or any other clinical trial we conduct, could cause the FDA to require that we repeat or conduct additional clinical studies. Despite the results reported in earlier clinical trials for PV-10 and PH-10, we do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates. If later stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, may be adversely impacted.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval.\nOur planned or ongoing clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Events which may result in delays or unsuccessful completion of clinical trials, including our future clinical trials, include inability to raise funding, initiate or continue a trial, delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial, delays in reaching agreement with the FDA or other regulatory authorities on final trial design, imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites, delays in obtaining required institutional review board (IRB) approval at each site, delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial, delays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up, delays caused by subjects dropping out of a trial, delays caused by clinical sites dropping out of a trial, time required to add new clinical sites or to obtain regulatory approval and open sites in geographic regions beyond the sites initially planned, and delays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIn addition, we may experience a number of unforeseen events during clinical trials for our prescription drug candidates, including PV-10 and PH-10, that could delay or prevent the commencement and/or completion of our clinical trials, including regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, the clinical study protocol may require one or more amendments delaying study completion, clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs, the number of subjects required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, subjects may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate and enrollment in these clinical trials has been significantly slower than we anticipated requiring us to expand the geographic scope of enrollment of patients, clinical investigators or study subjects may fail to comply with clinical study protocols, trial conduct and data analysis errors may occur, including, but not limited to, data entry and/or processing errors, our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, we might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our prescription drug candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements, the cost of clinical trials of our prescription drug candidates may be greater than we anticipate, the supply or quality of our clinical trial materials or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our prescription drug candidates may be insufficient or inadequate, and our prescription drug candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators to suspend or terminate the trials.\nMoreover, we or the FDA may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears, we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our submissions or the conduct of these trials. If initiation or completion of any of our clinical trials for our product candidates, are delayed for any of the above reasons or other reasons, our development costs may increase, the approval process could be delayed, any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our prescription drug candidates may be reduced and our competitors may bring drug products to market before us. Any of these events could impair our ability to generate revenues from drug product sales and impair our ability to generate regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our claims concerning our prescription drug candidates.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support acceptable label claims concerning our investigational drug product candidates. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our prescription drug candidates are safe for humans or effective for indicated uses.\nThis failure would cause us to abandon a prescription drug candidate and may delay development of other prescription drug candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay our ability to commercialize our prescription drug candidates and generate product revenues. In addition, we anticipate that our clinical trials will involve only a small patient population. Accordingly, the results of such trials may not be indicative of future results over a larger patient population.\nPhysicians and patients may not accept and use our prescription drug candidates.\nEven if the FDA approves our investigational drug product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Acceptance and use of our investigational drug products will depend upon a number of factors including perceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our investigational drug products, availability of reimbursement for our investigational drug products from government or other healthcare payers, and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nBecause we expect sales or licensure of our prescription drug candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of any of these drugs to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.\nWe have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities for our prescription drug candidates.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships, the collaborator\u2019s strategic interest in the prescription drug products under development and such collaborator\u2019s ability to successfully market and sell any such drug products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third party collaborators or develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. In addition, there can also be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our prescription drug candidates in the U.S. or internationally.\nCompetition in the prescription pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense.\nOther pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in research efforts related to treatment of cancer and dermatological conditions, which may compete with our clinical trials for patients and investigator resources, cause lower enrollment than anticipated, and could lead to the development of drug products or treatment therapies that could compete directly with our investigational drug product candidates that we are seeking to develop and market.\nMany companies are also developing novel therapies to treat cancer and dermatological conditions and, in this regard, are our competitors. Many of the pharmaceutical companies developing and marketing these competing products have greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing.\nSmaller companies may also prove to be competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with larger and more established companies that may compete with our efforts to establish similar collaborative arrangements. Academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development, and marketing of prescription drug candidates similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our drug development programs.\nIn addition to the above factors, we expect to face competition in product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory consents, availability of resources, reimbursement coverage, price, and patent position, including potentially dominant patent positions of others.\nSince our prescription drug candidates PV-10 and PH-10 have not yet been approved by the FDA or introduced to the marketplace, we cannot estimate what competition these prescription drug candidates might face when they are finally introduced, if at all. We cannot assure you that these prescription drug candidates will not face significant competition for other drug products, investigational drug products, and generic equivalents.\nIf we are unable to secure or enforce patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property our business could be harmed.\nWe may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for our prescription drug candidates and technologies we develop or license. In addition, our competitors may develop prescription drug candidates similar to ours using methods and technologies that are beyond the scope of our intellectual property protection, which could reduce our anticipated sales. While some of our prescription drug candidates have proprietary patent protection, a challenge to these patents can subject us to expensive litigation. Litigation concerning patents, other forms of intellectual property, and proprietary technology is becoming more widespread and can be protracted and expensive and can distract management and other personnel from performing their duties.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop a competitive position. We cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and technology, or that we can adequately protect our trade secrets and technology.\nIf we are unable to secure or enforce patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. If we infringe on the intellectual property of others, our business could be harmed.\nWe could be sued for infringing patents or other intellectual property that purportedly cover prescription drug candidates and/or methods of using such prescription drug candidates held by persons other than us. Litigation arising from an alleged infringement could result in removal from the market, or a substantial delay in, or prevention of, the introduction of our prescription drug candidates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we do not update and enhance our technologies, they will become obsolete.\nThe pharmaceutical market is characterized by technological change, and our future success will depend on our ability to conduct successful research in our fields of expertise, discover new technologies as a result of that research, develop products based on our technologies, and commercialize those products. While we believe that our current technology is adequate for our present needs, if we fail to stay at the forefront of technological development, we will be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may use greater resources to develop new pharmaceutical technologies and to commercialize products based on those technologies. Accordingly, our technologies may be rendered obsolete by advances in existing technologies or the development of different technologies by one or more of our current or future competitors.\nIf we lose any of our key personnel, we may be unable to successfully execute our business plan.\nOur business is presently managed by key employees, independent contractors, and Board members: (i) Timothy C. Scott, Ph.D., our President, (ii) Eric A. Wachter, Ph.D., our Chief Technology Officer (CTO), (iii) Bruce Horowitz, our Chief Operations Consultant, who is an independent contractor, (iv) John R. Glass, CPA, our Interim CFO, who is an independent contractor and (v) Dominic Rodrigues, CFA, who is vice chair of the Board.\nIn order to successfully execute our business plan, our management and board of directors must succeed in all of the following critical areas: researching diseases and possible therapies in the areas of oncology and dermatology, developing our prescription drugs candidates, marketing and selling developed prescription drug candidates, obtaining additional capital to finance research and development production, and marketing of our drug products, and managing our business as it grows.\nOn November 26, 2018, pursuant to Section 5(a) of the employment agreements between each of Drs. Scott and Wachter, and the Company, dated April 28, 2014, the Board provided notice to Drs. Scott and Wachter that the Company would not renew their employment agreements as of their April 28, 2019 expiration dates. The Company is evaluating and assessing potential future roles, responsibilities, duties, and compensation for Drs. Scott and Wachter.\nOn January 24, 2019, the Board of Directors provided Mr. Glass 60-day written notice of the Company\u2019s intent to terminate the independent contractor agreement between Mr. Glass and the Company, entered into on April 14, 2016 and amended on December 3, 2016. Mr. Glass will continue to serve in his current capacity with the Company until the effective date of the termination of the independent contractor agreement on March 25, 2019.\nDisruption resulting from management transition may have a detrimental impact on our ability to implement our strategy. The reduction in role and/or loss of key employees, contractors, and/or Board members could have a material adverse effect on our operations, and limit or constrain our ability to execute our business plan.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Among other things, these provisions will (i) permit our Board to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the Board without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock, (ii) provide that all vacancies on our Board, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, (iii) require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be affected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent, (iv) provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide advance notice in writing, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice, (v) not provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, and (vi) provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Board or by such person or persons requested by a majority of the Board to call such meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur stock price is below $5.00 per share and is treated as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which places restrictions on broker-dealers recommending the stock for purchase.\nOur common stock is defined as \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the Exchange Act and its rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to include common stock that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules include the following requirements: (i) broker-dealers must deliver, prior to the transaction, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, (ii) broker-dealers must disclose the commissions payable to the broker-dealer and its registered representative, (iii) broker-dealers must disclose current quotations for the securities, and (iv) a broker-dealer must furnish its customers with monthly statements disclosing recent price information for all penny stocks held in the customer\u2019s account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nAdditional sales practice requirements are imposed on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. If our common stock remains subject to these penny stock rules these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. As a result, fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our stock, which could affect a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell their shares.\nFuture sales by our stockholders may adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nSales of our common stock in the public market following any prospective offering could lower the market price of our common stock. Sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable.\nIt is our general policy to retain any earnings for use in our operation.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, for use in our business and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, although we intend to issue shares of common stock in satisfaction of the dividend payments due on our Series B Preferred Stock.", "PERMNO": 68276, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PVCT"}
