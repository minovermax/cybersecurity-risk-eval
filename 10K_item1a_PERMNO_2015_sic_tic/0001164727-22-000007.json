RISK FACTORS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nOur business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Business\nOur operations and business have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be materially and adversely impacted in the future.\nThe Company faces risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases, which could significantly disrupt operations and may materially and adversely affect its business and financial conditions. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts on the world, our industry and our Company. Despite the strong protocols we have in place, COVID-19, the delta and omicron variants and other new variants which may emerge present ongoing risks and challenges, and is expected to continue to impact our people, operations and surrounding Communities. Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 impacted the operation of Newmont\u2019s mines and the development of projects and exploration activities and may continue to do so in the future. The governments in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate implemented restrictive measures such as travel bans, quarantine and self-isolation at various times during the pandemic and may do so again in the future. The scope and duration of any such restrictions remains outside of the Company\u2019s control. The Company carefully considers government restrictions and the needs of its employees and host communities. Additionally, based upon evolving contagion rates or occurrences at our operating sites, senior management or the Board may be required to or decide to reduce or limit operational activities to essential care and maintenance procedures including the management of critical environmental systems. For example, in order to protect nearby communities and align with government travel restrictions or health considerations certain of Newmont\u2019s operations were temporarily put into care and maintenance resulting in a temporary decrease in production at these sites in 2020 and 2021. Additionally, the majority of our sites experienced pandemic-related absenteeism in 2021. With the surge of the omicron variant in January 2022, the Company is continuing to experience reduced staffing and absenteeism at several sites. Reductions in our operational activities due to COVID-19 could result in additional sites being placed into care and maintenance for extended periods of time and/or have a material adverse impact on our business, or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If the majority of our sites are placed into care and maintenance, this could significantly reduce our cash flow and impact our ability to meet certain covenants related to our revolving credit facility and borrowing capacity.\nThe Company incurred, and will continue to incur costs as a result of actions taken to protect against the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and to comply with local mandates, including but not limited to contributions to the Newmont Global Community Support Fund, additional health screenings, incremental travel, security and employee-related costs. Other impacts of changing government restrictions and the evolving health environment could include prolonged travel restraints, more stringent shipment restraints, delays in product refining and smelting due to restrictions or temporary closures, other supply chain disruptions and workforce interruptions, including loss of life, and reputational damage in connection with challenges or reactions to action or perceived inaction by the Company related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial position.\nA substantial or extended decline in gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the prices of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence prices include:\n\u2022Gold sales, purchases or leasing by governments and central banks;\n\u2022Speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc or other metals;\n\u2022The relative strength of the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022The monetary policies employed by the world\u2019s major Central Banks;\n\u2022The fiscal policies employed by the world\u2019s major industrialized economies;\n\u2022Expectations of the future rate of inflation;\n\u2022Interest rates;\n\u2022Recession or reduced economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries;\n\u2022Decreased industrial, jewelry, base metal or investment demand;\n\u2022Increased import and export taxes;\n\u2022Increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;\n\u2022Forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions;\n\u2022Availability of cheaper substitute materials; and\n\u2022Changing investor or consumer sentiment, including in connection with transition to a low-carbon economy, investor interest in crypto currencies and other investment alternatives and other factors.\nAverage gold prices for 2021 were $1,799 per ounce (2020: $1,770; 2019: $1,393), average copper prices for 2021 were $4.23 per pound (2020: $2.80; 2019: $2.72), average silver prices for 2021 were $25.12 per ounce (2020: $20.55; 2019: $16.21), average lead prices for 2021 were $1.00 per pound (2020: $0.83; 2019: $0.91) and average zinc prices for 2021 were $1.36 per pound (2020: $1.03; 2019: $1.16). Any decline in our realized prices adversely impacts our revenues, net income and operating cash flows, particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to sales of gold, silver, copper, lead or zinc. We have recorded asset impairments in the past and may experience additional impairments as a result of lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices in the future.\nIn addition, sustained lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices can:\n\u2022Reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that have become uneconomic at sustained lower metal prices;\n\u2022Reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads and increase the likelihood and amount that the Company might be required to record write downs related to the carrying value of its stockpiles and ore on leach pads;\n\u2022Halt or delay the development of new projects;\n\u2022Reduce funds available for exploration and advanced projects with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and\n\u2022Reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices\nWe may be unable to replace gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead reserves as they become depleted.\nMining companies must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.\nWe may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore reserves from others related to development properties and operating mines. Such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. Other factors that affect our decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our assumptions for future gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices or other mineral prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or potential liabilities associated with the property and its operations and projections of how these may change in the future. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties (including ability to permit and compliance with existing regulations) and which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. Other than historical operating results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our revenue, our cash flow and other operating issues, as well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate reserves and resources. In addition, there may be intense competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.\nEstimates of proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.\nThe reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc that we estimated, at December 31, 2021, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, or will be, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. If our reserve estimations are required to be revised due to significantly lower gold, silver, zinc, copper and lead prices, increases in operating costs, reductions in metallurgical recovery or other modifying factors, this could result in material write-downs of our investment in mining properties, goodwill and increased amortization, reclamation and closure charges.\nProducers use feasibility studies for undeveloped ore bodies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating and capital cost and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic feasibility of production may change.\nAdditionally, resource does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the SEC or the Company\u2019s standards. Estimates of measured, indicated and inferred resources are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Inferred resources, in particular, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and their economic and legal feasibility. The Company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the resource will ever be converted into reserves.\nIn addition, if the price of gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead declines from recent levels, if production costs increase, grades decline, recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, the indicated level of recovery may not be realized or mineral reserves or resources might not be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our mineral reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves and resources. Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and resources are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position may be materially impaired.\nEstimates relating to projects and mine plans of existing operations are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated.\nMine development and expansion projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. Such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up. Our decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others:\n\u2022Changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed;\n\u2022Changes in input commodity and labor costs;\n\u2022The quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made;\n\u2022Adverse geotechnical conditions;\n\u2022Availability of adequate and skilled labor force;\n\u2022Availability, supply and cost of water and power;\n\u2022Fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates;\n\u2022Availability and terms of financing;\n\u2022Delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development;\n\u2022Changes in tax laws, the laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes due to the regional and national governments and royalty agreements;\n\u2022Weather or severe climate impacts, including, without limitation, prolonged or unexpected precipitation, drought and/or sub-zero temperatures;\n\u2022Potential delays and restrictions in connection with health and safety issues, including pandemics (such as COVID-19) and other infectious diseases;\n\u2022Potential delays relating to social and community issues, including, without limitation, issues resulting in protests, road blockages or work stoppages; and\n\u2022Potential challenges to mining activities or to permits or other approvals or delays in development and construction of projects based on claims of disturbance of cultural resources or the inability to secure consent for such disturbance.\nNew projects require, among other things, the successful completion of feasibility studies, attention to various fiscal, tax and royalty matters, obtainment of, and compliance with, required governmental permits and arrangements for necessary surface and other land rights. We may also have to identify adequate sources of water and power for new projects, ensure that appropriate community infrastructure (for example, reliable rail, ports, roads, and bridges) is developed to support the project and secure appropriate financing to fund a new project. These infrastructures and services are often provided by third parties whose operational activities are outside of our control. Establishing infrastructure for our development projects requires significant resources, identification of adequate sources of raw materials and supplies, and the cooperation of national and regional governments, none of which can be assured. In addition, new projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future financial and operating performance, including future cash flow. Thus, it is possible that actual costs may increase significantly and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates. Consequently, our future development activities may not result in the expansion or replacement of current production with new production, or one or more of these new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than currently anticipated or may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nFor our existing operations, we base our mine plans on geological and metallurgical assumptions, financial projections and commodity price estimates. These estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations, including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and resources, revisions to environmental obligations, changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other significant events associated with mining operations. Further, future positive revisions, if any, remain subject to improvements in costs, recovery, commodity price or a combination of these and other factors. Additionally, we review our operations for events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are determined to exist at our mine operations, and an impairment charge is incurred, such charges are not\nreversible at a later date even when favorable modifications to our proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources, favorable revisions to environmental obligations, favorable changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other favorable events occur. As a result of these uncertainties, actual results may be less favorable than estimated returns and initial financial outlook.\nIncreased operating and capital costs could affect our profitability.\nCosts at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel, concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow.\nOur operational costs, including, without limitation, labor costs, can be impacted by inflation. Certain of our operations are located in countries that have in the past experienced high rates of inflation, such as in Argentina and Suriname. It is possible that in the future, high inflation in the countries in which we operate may result in an increase in operational costs in local currencies (without a concurrent devaluation of the local currency of operations against the dollar or an increase in the dollar price of gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead). A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow.\nWe could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with new projects, costs related to closure reclamation activities, and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond our control. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the profitability of and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects. Significantly higher and sustained increases in operational costs or capital expenditures could result in the deferral or closure of projects and mines in the event that costs become prohibitive.\nMine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.\nNatural resource extractive companies are required to close their operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs for gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead mining operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and mine closure plans that may change materially.\nAdditionally, we may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third party sites or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (\u201cCERCLA\u201d) and its state law equivalents, current or former owners of properties may be held jointly and severally liable for the costs of site cleanup or required to undertake remedial actions in response to unpermitted releases of hazardous substances at such property, in addition to, among other potential consequences, liability to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be significant. These subject properties are referred to as \u201csuperfund\u201d sites. For example, the inactive Midnite uranium mine is a superfund site subject to CERCLA. It is possible that certain of our other current or former operations in the U.S. could be designated as a superfund site in the future, exposing us to potential liability under CERCLA.\nThe laws and regulations governing mine closure and reclamation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. For a more detailed description of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, regulators are increasingly requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit, trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of environmental obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position. Any underestimated or unanticipated retirement and rehabilitation costs could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income attributable to Newmont stockholders and potentially result in impairments.\nFor example, in early 2015 and again in June 2017, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the Ministry of the Environment (\u201cMINAM\u201d), issued proposed modifications to water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria modified the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In 2017, Yanacocha submitted a modification to its previously approved compliance achievement plan to the Mining Ministry (\u201cMINEM\u201d). The Company did not receive a response or comments to this submission until 2021 and is in the process of updating its compliance achievement plan to address these comments.\nDuring this interim period, Yanacocha separately submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment modification considering the ongoing operations and the projects to be developed and obtained authorization from MINEM for such projects. This authorization included a deadline for compliance with the modified water quality criteria by January 2024. Consequently, part of the Company response to MINEM will include a request for an extension of time for coming into full compliance with the new regulations. In the event that MINEM does not grant Yanacocha an extension of the previously authorized timeline for, and agree to, the updated compliance achievement plan, fines and penalties relating to non-compliance may result beyond January 2024.\nThe Company is conducting detailed studies to better estimate water management and other closure activities that will ensure water quality and quantity discharge requirements, including the modifications promulgated by MINAM, as referenced above, will be met. This also includes performing a comprehensive update to the Yanacocha reclamation plan to address changes in closure activities and estimated closure costs while preserving optionality for potential future projects at Yanacocha. These ongoing studies, which will extend beyond the current year, were progressed in the fourth quarter of 2021 as the study team continued to evaluate and revise assumptions and estimated costs of changes to the reclamation plan. While certain estimated costs remain subject to revision, in conjunction with the Company\u2019s annual 2021 update process for all asset retirement obligations, the Company recorded an increase of $1,597 to the Yanacocha reclamation liability based on the progress of the closure studies with a corresponding non-cash charge of $1,554 recorded to reclamation expense related to portions of site operations no longer in production with no expected substantive future economic value and $43 recorded as an increase to the asset retirement cost for producing areas of the operation. The annual 2021 update included an initial consideration of known risks (including the associated risk that water treatment estimates could change in the future as more work is completed). However, these and other risks and contingencies that are the subject of ongoing studies could result in future material increases to the reclamation obligation at Yanacocha, including, but not limited to, a comprehensive review of our tailings storage facility management, review of Yanacocha\u2019s water balance and storm water management system and review of post-closure management costs. The ongoing Yanacocha closure studies are expected to be progressed in 2022 and continue in the future. Future material increases or decreases to the asset retirement obligation could occur as additional analyses are completed and further refinements to water quality and volume modeling are completed. Additionally, revisions to the Yanacocha reclamation plan may change in connection with the Company\u2019s ultimate submission and review of the plan with Peruvian regulators. Refer to Notes 6 and 26 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding reclamation and remediation, and Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the Company\u2019s interest in Yanacocha.\nDamage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nDamage to our reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of a variety of events and circumstances, and could result in negative publicity (for example, with respect to handling of environmental, safety and security matters, dealings with local community organizations or individuals, community commitments, handling of cultural sites or resources, and various other matters).\nWe have also provided greater transparency on environmental, social and governance performance in response to stakeholder engagement and requests in recent years, and provide supplemental disclosures in our Annual Sustainability Report and other sustainability reports on our website in connection with stakeholder concerns and issues. Such increased transparency may result in greater scrutiny and impact how the Company is perceived.\nOur Code of Conduct (the \u201cCode\u201d) forms the foundation of our internal governance structure as well as our commitment to responsible mining. We encourage employees and others to promptly report incidents of possible violations of the Code and/or our global policies and standards, including in the areas of business integrity, social and environmental, community relations and human rights. Employees and non-employees, including suppliers and community members, can anonymously report concerns via our third-party helpline. Each mine site has a complaints and grievances register to record matters raised by local stakeholders. When necessary, we use independent mechanisms agreed to by the complainants, such as a local leader or committee, to facilitate resolution of such matters before they require public or legal intervention. However, we are not always able to resolve these matters before they are raised publicly or in legal or regulatory proceedings and in the future we may not be able to meet the growing demands of stakeholders through these mechanisms. Such matters once publicized may negatively impact our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe growing use of social media to generate, publish and discuss community news and issues and to connect with others has made it significantly easier, among other things, for individuals and groups to share their opinions of us and our activities, whether true or not. We do not have direct control over how we are perceived by others and any resulting loss of reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon information technology and operational technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation, upgrade, operation and integration.\nWe are dependent upon information technology and operational technology systems. The operating and control systems at our mines increasingly leverage technology-based solutions based on a combination of on-premises and cloud-based platforms. These systems are crucial for operating our mines safely and efficiently. Our systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, may be targeted by increasingly sophisticated threat actors. These threats include continually evolving cybersecurity risks from\na variety of sources, including, without limitation, malware, computer viruses, cyber threats, extortion, employee error, malfeasance, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity risk is increasingly difficult to identify and quantify and cannot be fully mitigated because of the rapidly evolving nature of the threats, and the increasing sophistication of the threat actors. Additionally, unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems for company information through fraud or other means of deceiving our third-party service providers, employees or vendors. We have experienced attempts by external parties to compromise our networks and systems. For example, in 2020, we detected a cyberattack on our systems. Although we were able to respond quickly to stop the continued spread of the threat, it took significant time and resources to fully identify the scope of the attack and to recover our systems and data. The cost of responding to and remediating such event was immaterial. Although the 2020 attempts and other cyber incidents to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for preparing and protecting against such attempts and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient against future attacks. Any future material compromise or breach of our IT systems could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions. Outages in our operational technology may affect operations related to health and safety and could result in putting lives at risk of harm or death. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cybersecurity attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm. Such efforts may prove insufficient to deter future cybersecurity attacks or prevent all security breaches. While we maintain general insurance, we no longer maintain specific insurance policies covering cybersecurity risk due to increased premium costs and restrictions to coverage, and, as such, any events for which we are not insured may results in additional costs and could affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. System modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nTo the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or enter into any joint ventures, our interest in these properties is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of joint ventures.\nTo the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or enter into any joint ventures in the future, the existence or occurrence of one or more of the following circumstances and events could have a material adverse impact on our profitability or the viability of our interests held through joint ventures, which could have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition:\n\u2022inconsistent economic, political or business interests or goals between partners or disagreements with partners on strategy for the most efficient development or operation of mines;\n\u2022inability to control certain strategic decisions made in respect of properties;\n\u2022exercise of majority rights by our partners so as to take actions for which we may not believe to be in the joint venture\u2019s best interests, including but not limited to decisions related to labor relations, litigation, government relations, political contributions, community relations, project approval and project funding mechanisms;\n\u2022inability of partners to meet their financial and other obligations to the joint venture or third parties; and\n\u2022litigation between partners regarding management, funding or other decisions related to the joint venture.\nTo the extent that we are not the operator of a joint venture properties, such that we will be unable to control the activities of the operator, the success of such operations will be beyond our control. In many cases we will be bound by the decisions made by the operator in the operation of such property, and will rely on the operator to manage the property and to provide accurate information related to such property. We can provide no assurance that all decisions of operators of properties we do not control will achieve the expected results.\nFor example, our joint ventures, including the joint venture that combines our and Barrick Gold Corporation\u2019s (\u201cBarrick\u201d) respective Nevada operations, forming NGM, pursuant to the operating agreement entered into on July 1, 2019 between Barrick, Newmont and their wholly-owned subsidiaries party thereto (the \u201cNevada JV Agreement\u201d), may not be as beneficial to us as expected, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, integration challenges, political risks, labor disputes or other factors. Pursuant to the terms of the Nevada JV Agreement, we hold a 38.5 percent economic interest and Barrick holds a 61.5 percent economic interest in NGM. Barrick operates NGM with overall management responsibility and is subject to the supervision and direction of NGM\u2019s Board of Managers, which is comprised of three managers appointed by Barrick and two managers appointed by Newmont. Outside of certain prescribed matters, decisions of the Board of Managers will be determined by majority vote, with the managers appointed by each company having voting power in proportion to such company\u2019s economic interests in NGM. Because we beneficially own less than a majority of the ownership and governance interests in NGM, we have limited control of NGM\u2019s operations and we depend on Barrick to operate NGM. In the event that Barrick has\ninterests, objectives and incentives with respect to NGM that differ from our own, there can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve such disagreement in our favor. Any such disagreement could have a material adverse effect on our interest in NGM, the business of NGM or the portion of our growth strategy related to NGM. Additionally, to the extent NGM is subject to liabilities or litigation, we would be responsible for a proportional share of certain liabilities and/or NGM\u2019s operations could be impacted, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial position.\nAdditionally, the Company is subject to certain funding requirements in connection with its joint ventures. Joint venture funding requirements, as well as the ability of partners to meet their financial and other obligations, may result in increases to our costs and required capital expenditures. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information including with respect to loan agreements with Pueblo Viejo.\nFinancial Risk\nIncreased exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and capital controls may adversely affect Newmont\u2019s costs, earnings and the value of some of our assets.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and the majority of our earnings and cash flows are denominated in U.S. dollars. We conduct certain business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of those local currencies against the U.S. dollar increases our costs of production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the United States. The foreign currencies that primarily affect our results of operations are the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. Our consolidated earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by movements in the exchange rates. Change in the value of the currencies of the Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso, the Argentine Peso, the Ghana Cedi, the Chilean Peso or Surinamese Dollar versus the U.S. dollar could negatively impact our earnings. For information concerning the sensitivity of our Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and more information our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, see Foreign Currency Exchange Rates section in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition, from time to time, countries in which we operate adopt measures to restrict the availability of the local currency or the repatriation of capital across borders. These measures are imposed by governments or central banks, in some cases during times of economic instability, to prevent the removal of capital or the sudden devaluation of local currencies or to maintain in-country foreign currency reserves. In addition, many emerging market countries require consents or reporting processes before local currency earnings can be converted into U.S. dollars or other currencies and/or such earnings can be repatriated or otherwise transferred outside of the operating jurisdiction. These measures may have a number of negative effects on Newmont, reducing the immediately available capital that we could otherwise deploy for investment opportunities or the payment of expenses. In addition, measures that restrict the availability of the local currency or impose a requirement to operate in the local currency may create other practical difficulties for Newmont. For example, Argentina has been considered a hyperinflationary environment with a cumulative inflation rate of over 100% for the last four years. In recent years, Argentina\u2019s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency. These restrictions directly impact the timing of Cerro Negro's ability to remit cash from gold sales and pay interest and principal portions of intercompany debt to the Company. For more information, see Results of Consolidated Operations and Foreign Currency Exchange Rates sections in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nFuture funding requirements may affect our business, our ability to pay cash dividends or our ability to engage in share repurchase transactions.\nPotential future investments, including projects in the Company\u2019s project pipeline, acquisitions and other investments, will require significant funds for capital expenditures. Depending on gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead prices, our operating cash flow may not be sufficient to meet all of these expenditures, depending on the timing of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities, and fund construction and operation of potential future projects. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. We may determine that it may be necessary or preferable to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. However, U.S. and global markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions, and the COVID-19 pandemic has increased, and may continue to increase, volatility and pricing in the capital markets. Additional financing may not be commercially available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, any additional financing may involve substantial dilution to existing shareholders. In the event of lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt, repurchase shares and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. If we are unable to obtain financing or service existing or future debt we could be required to reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments to stockholders or any planned share repurchase transactions. The Company\u2019s repurchase program may be discontinued at any time, and the program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock or to repurchase the full authorized amount during the authorization period. Consequently, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate such share repurchase authorization in the future. See also the risk factor under the heading \u201cHolders of our\ncommon stock may not receive dividends.\u201d In addition, our joint venture partners may not have sufficient funds or borrowing ability in order to make their capital commitments. In the case that our partners do not make their economic commitments, the Company may be prevented from pursuing certain development opportunities or may assume additional financial obligations, which may require new sources of capital.\nOur long-lived assets and goodwill could become impaired, which could have a material non-cash adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe review our operations for events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are determined to exist at our mine operations, we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. We also review our goodwill for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Management makes multiple assumptions in estimating future cash flows, which include production levels based on life of mine plans, future costs of production, estimates of future production levels based on value beyond proven and probable reserves at our operations, prices of metals, the historical experience of our operations and other factors. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating production levels of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead and the costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges. We may be required to recognize material non-cash charges relating to impairments of long-lived assets and/or goodwill in the future if actual results differ materially from management\u2019s estimates, which include metal prices, our ability to reduce or control production costs or capital costs through strategic mine optimization initiatives, increased costs or decreased production due to regulatory issues or if we do not realize the mineable reserves, resources or exploration potential at our mining properties. If an impairment charge is incurred, such charges are not reversible at a later date even when favorable modifications to our proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources, favorable revisions to environmental obligations, favorable changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, or other favorable events occur. As a result of these uncertainties, our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment, and actual results may be less favorable than estimated returns and initial financial outlook. For additional information regarding goodwill, see Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.\nWe recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. In the future, our estimates could change requiring a valuation allowance or impairment of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading \u201cIncome and Mining Taxes - Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\u201d and Note 2 under the heading \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies - Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\u201d for additional information and factors that could impact the Company\u2019s ability to realize the deferred tax assets. For additional information regarding Newmont\u2019s non-current deferred tax assets, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAny downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could increase our future borrowing costs and adversely affect the availability of new financing.\nThere can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services or Moody\u2019s Investors Service to Newmont will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. The Company\u2019s credit ratings have been subject to change over the years. We currently maintain a Standard & Poor\u2019s rating of \u201cBBB\u201d (positive outlook) and a Moody\u2019s Investors Service rating of Baa1 (stable). We cannot make assurances regarding how long these ratings will remain unchanged or regarding the outcome of the rating agencies future reviews (including following any planned or future business combinations). A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase our borrowing costs, which in turn could impair our results of operations and financial position.\nReturns for investments in pension plans are uncertain.\nWe maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide for specified payments after retirement. The Company\u2019s qualified pension plans are funded with cash contributions in compliance with IRS rules and regulations. The Company\u2019s non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading \u201cPension and Other Benefit Plans\u201d for additional information regarding the funding status of qualified and non-qualified plans. The Company reviews its retirement benefit programs on a regular basis and will consider market conditions\nand the funded status of its qualified pension plans in determining whether additional contributions are appropriate. The ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. If future plan investment returns are not sufficient, we may be required to increase the amount of future cash contributions.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining.\nThe exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals;\n\u2022Industrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining equipment, milling equipment and/or conveyor systems and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations, milling and processing;\n\u2022Accidents in connection with transportation, including transportation of chemicals, explosions or other materials, transportation of large mining equipment and transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites;\n\u2022Social, community or labor force disputes resulting in work stoppages or shipping delays, such as at Pe\u00f1asquito, Cerro Negro, Merian and Akyem, or related loss of social acceptance of community support;\n\u2022Changes to legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022Security incidents, including activities of illegal or artisanal miners, gold bullion or concentrate theft, including in transport, and corruption and fraud;\n\u2022Shortages in materials or equipment and energy and electrical power supply interruptions or rationing;\n\u2022Failure of unproven or evolving technologies or loss of information integrity or data;\n\u2022Unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form);\n\u2022Metallurgical conditions and gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc and other metal recovery, including unexpected decline of ore grade;\n\u2022Unanticipated changes in inventory levels at heap-leach operations;\n\u2022Ground and water conditions;\n\u2022Fall-of-ground accidents in underground operations;\n\u2022Failure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls;\n\u2022Seismic activity;\n\u2022Surface or underground fires or floods; and\n\u2022Other natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or tropical storms, floods or other inclement weather conditions, including those impacting operations or the ability to access and supply sites.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities, development and production and closure of mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.\nWe compete with other natural resource companies, and shortage of critical parts and equipment may adversely affect our operations and development projects.\nWe compete with other natural resource companies for specialized equipment and supplies necessary for exploration and development, as well as for rights to mine properties containing gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and other minerals. The mining industry has been impacted, from time to time, by increased demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, trucks, shovels and tires. These shortages have, at times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted in cost increases and delays in construction of projects; thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and production and construction schedules. We may be unable to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain or retain necessary permits, which could adversely affect our operations.\nOur mining and processing operations and development and exploration activities are subject to extensive permitting requirements. The requirements to obtain and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits can be costly and involve extended timelines. While we strive to obtain and comply with all permits required of us, there can be no assurance that we will obtain all such permits and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits at all times. Previously obtained permits may be suspended or revoked for a number of reasons, including through government or court action. Failure to obtain and/or comply with required permits can have serious consequences, including damage to our reputation\u037e cessation of the development of a project; increased costs of development or production and litigation or regulatory action, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur ability to obtain the required permits and approvals to explore for, develop and operate mines and to successfully operate near communities in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends in part on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to operate near certain communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, health and safety of communities in which we operate. Key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be adjusted in a manner that adversely affects our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations.\nMining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate in order to maintain operations.\nGreater scrutiny on the private sector broadly and multi-national companies specifically, to contribute to sustainable outcomes in the places where they operate, has led to a proliferation of standards and reporting initiatives focused on environmental stewardship, social performance and transparency. Extractive industries, and mining in particular, have seen significant increases in stakeholder expectations. These businesses are increasingly required to meaningfully engage with impacted stakeholders; understand and avoid or mitigate negative impacts while optimizing economic development and employment opportunities associated with their operations. The expectation is for companies to create shared value for shareholders, employees, governments, local communities and host countries. Such expectations tend to be particularly focused on companies whose activities are perceived to have high socio-economic and environmental impacts. In response, Newmont has over many years developed and continues to evolve a robust system of ESG management that includes standards, guidance, assurance, participation in international organizations focused on improved performance and outcomes for host communities and the environment. In Ghana, for instance, in response to resettlement-related complaints, Newmont worked with national and local government authorities, traditional leaders, impacted farmers/landowners and other concerned stakeholders to analyze impacts, extend programs to support vulnerable households and provide enhanced livelihood support. Despite the Company\u2019s commitment to on-going engagement with communities and stakeholders, no assurances can be provided that increased stakeholder expectations will not result in adverse financial and operational impacts to the business, including, without limitation, operational disruption, increased costs, increased investment obligations and increased taxes and royalties payable to governments.\nIllegal mining and artisanal mining occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties exposing such sites to security risks.\nArtisanal and illegal miners have been active on, or adjacent to, some of Newmont\u2019s African and South American properties, including in Suriname and Ghana in recent years. For example, in Ghana in 2019, illegal miners attacked a field team of security guards employed by a security contractor, tragically resulting in a fatality. Illegal mining, which involves trespass into the development or operating area of the mine, is both a security and safety issue, which may present a security threat to property and human life. The illegal miners from time to time have clashed with security staff and law enforcement personnel who have attempted to move them away from the facilities. Although, under certain circumstances, artisanal mining may be a legally sanctioned activity, artisanal mining is also associated with a number of negative impacts, including environmental degradation, poor working practices, erosion of civil society, human rights abuse and funding of conflict. The environmental, social, safety and health impacts of artisanal and illegal mining are frequently attributed to formal large scale mining activity, and it is often assumed that artisanally-mined gold is channeled through large-scale mining operators, even though artisanal and large-scale miners normally have separate and distinct supply chains. These misconceptions impact negatively on the reputation of the industry. The activities of the illegal miners could cause damage to Newmont\u2019s properties or result in inappropriate or unlawful use of force for which Newmont could potentially be held responsible. The presence of illegal miners could lead to exploration and project delays and disputes regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits. Illegal mining and theft could also result in lost gold production and reserves, mine and development stoppages, and have a material adverse effect on financial condition or results of operations or project development.\nCivil disturbances and criminal activities can disrupt business and expose the Company to liability.\nCivil disturbances and criminal activities such as trespass, illegal mining, sabotage, theft, blockades and vandalism may cause disruptions and could result in the suspension of operations, delays to project development and negative impacts on exploration activities at certain sites. Incidents of such activities have occasionally led to conflict with security personnel and/or police, which in\nsome cases resulted in injuries including in Ghana, Peru, Mexico and Suriname. Additionally some areas in which we conduct operations, develop projects and exploration activities are affected by persistent violence and crime, such as in Mexico.\nAlthough security measures have been implemented by the Company to protect employees, community members, property and assets, such measures will not guarantee that such civil disturbances and criminal activities will not continue to occur in the future, or result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, decrease operational efficiency or construction delays, increase community tensions or result in liabilities or reputational harm to Newmont. Security incidents, in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our operations, including reclamation activities, especially if criminal activity and violence continue to escalate. Such incidents may halt or delay production, increase operating costs; result in harm to employees, contractors, visitors or community members; decrease operational efficiency due to employee absenteeism and other factors; increase community tensions or otherwise adversely affect our ability to conduct business. The manner in which the Company\u2019s personnel, national police or other security forces respond to civil disturbances and criminal activities can give rise to additional risks where those responses are not conducted in a manner consistent with international and Newmont standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights. Newmont takes seriously our obligation to respect and promote human rights, is a signatory to and active participant in the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, and has adopted a Sustainability and Stakeholder Engagement Policy and Human Rights Standard in-line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Nonetheless, although the Company has implemented a number of significant measures and safeguards which are intended to ensure that personnel understand and uphold these standards, the implementation of these measures will not guarantee that personnel, national police or other security forces will uphold these standards in every instance. The evolving expectations related to human rights, indigenous rights, and environmental protections may result in opposition to our current and future operations, the development of new projects and mines, and exploration activities. Such opposition may take the form of legal or administrative proceedings or manifestations such as protests, roadblocks or other forms of public expression against our activities, and may have a negative impact on our local or global reputation and operations. Opposition by community and activist groups to our operations may require modification of, or preclude the operation or development of, our projects and mines or may require us to enter into agreements with such groups or local governments with respect to our projects and mines or exploration activities, in some cases, causing increased costs and significant delays to the advancement of our projects. For example, in Peru, our Conga project faced opposition from anti-mining activists, after which we suspended construction on the project\u2019s mining facilities and eventually reclassified Conga\u2019s reserves to resource as the result of certain operating and construction permits expiring at the end of 2015. The failure to conduct operations in accordance with Company standards can result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, increase community tensions, reputational harm to Newmont or result in criminal and/or civil liability and/or financial damages or penalties.\nOur operations face substantial regulation of health and safety.\nOur operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations governing worker health and safety across our operating regions and our failure to comply with applicable legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur mines are inspected on a regular basis by government regulators who may issue citations and orders when they believe a violation has occurred under local mining regulations. If inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures.\nIn addition to potential government restrictions and regulatory fines, penalties or sanctions, our ability to operate (including the effect of any impact on our workforce) and thus, our results of operations and our financial position (including because of potential related fines and sanctions), could be adversely affected by accidents, injuries, fatalities or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate.\nOur operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.\nOur exploration, development, mining and processing operations, and closed facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing land use and the protection of the environment, which generally apply to air and water, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species, hazardous and non-hazardous waste management and reclamation. Many of the countries in which we operate have laws and regulations related to water (quality and quantity), nature and greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\") emissions which are becoming increasingly more stringent. We have made, and expect to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and burdens, and can cause delays in obtaining, failure to obtain or renew, or cancellation of, government permits and approvals which may adversely impact our operations and closure processes. Increased global attention or regulation on consumption of shared resources and use products or development of waste that have the potential to impact human health and the environment could similarly have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to increased compliance and input costs.\nOur operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy.\nClimate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy is expected to impact Newmont in a number of ways. Producing gold is an energy-intensive business, currently resulting in a significant carbon footprint. Transitioning to a lower-carbon economy will require significant investment and may entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. Depending on the nature, speed, focus and jurisdiction of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to the business.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. At the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\u201cUNFCC\u201d) held in Paris in 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted which was intended to govern emission reductions beyond 2020. Newmont supports the UNFCC goal of limiting global warming to \u201cwell below 2oC\u201d compared to pre-industrial levels and plans to transition its operations to meet this goal by 2030, with an aspiration of carbon neutrality by 2050. In 2020, Newmont also announced plans to significantly invest in climate change initiatives in support of this goal, and additional material investments and capital expenditures may be required in order to meet our climate targets in the future. Inconsistent implementation or significant delay in the implementation of country-level policy related to the Paris Agreement and enhanced framework objectives announced at the most recent annual UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in November 2021 are likely to increase the risk for future swings in regulatory impacts and rapid shifts to low-carbon technologies.\nPolicy and regulatory risk related to actual and proposed changes in climate- and water-related laws, regulations and taxes developed to regulate the transition to a low-carbon economy may result in increased costs for our operations, venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Regulatory uncertainty may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than originally estimated for new development projects and operations, including closure reclamation obligations. For example, operational and capital expenses are expected to increase in order to meet renewable portfolio standard requirements by 50% or greater from current costs over the next 10 years in Australia, Canada, Mexico and the U.S. carbon taxes, fuel switching and the transition to cleaner purchased power and/or on-site renewable energy generation will require significant upfront capital expenditures and may also increase operating costs. As another example, the carbon tax in Canada of $30CAD/tonne of CO2 is expected to increase to $50CAD/tonne in 2022, impacting operating costs at our Canadian operations. We expect the potential for similar tax increases in other jurisdictions. Additionally, we do not maintain insurance policies against such climate-related risks or taxes.\nThe development and deployment of technological improvements or innovations will be required to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, which could result in write-offs and early retirement of existing assets, increased costs to adopt and deploy new practices and processing including planning and design for mines, development of alternative power sources, site level efficiencies and other capital investments. We will also be evaluating the use of carbon offsets to support meeting our targets for those hard to abate emissions.\nThere will be varied and complex market impacts due to climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. There will be shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, products and services in connection with evolving consumer and investor sentiments. Market perceptions of the mining sector, and, in particular, the role that certain metals will or will not play in the transition to a low-carbon economy remains uncertain. Potential financial impacts may include reduced investment in gold due to shift in investor sentiment, increased production costs due to changing input prices, re-pricing of land valuation and assets, increased global competition for key materials needed for new technologies (lithium, copper, rare earth minerals used in solar technology, etc.), potential costs increases by insurers and lenders, and potential increases in taxation of the mining and metals sector.\nShould the mining and metals sector not respond quickly enough to meeting globally accepted science-based reductions required to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change, industry members may be subject to an increased risk of future climate litigation. In the U.S. and Canada, lawsuits have been filed against oil and gas companies to assign liability for climate-related impacts. Over time, litigation may also apply to other resource intensive sectors that fail to set and/or meet long-term reduction targets. While the Company is not currently subject to any lawsuits related to climate, no assurances can be provided that similar suits will not be brought in the future.\nA failure to meet our climate strategy commitments and/or societal or investor expectations could also result in damage to our reputation, decreased investor confidence and challenges in maintaining positive community relations, which can pose additional obstacles to our ability to conduct our operations and develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects. Further, the Company\u2019s financing strategy is tied to its ESG commitments. The interest rate of Newmont\u2019s $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.600% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2032 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) is linked to Newmont\u2019s performance against key ESG commitments regarding 2030 emissions reduction targets and the representation of women in senior leadership roles target. The interest rate margin of Newmont\u2019s $3.0 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility is also subject to adjustment based on the Company\u2019s ESG scores. As such, a failure to meet our climate and sustainability targets can result in further expense and impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur targets are uniquely tailored to our business, operations and capabilities, which do not easily lend to benchmarking against similar sustainability performance targets, and the related performance, of other companies. We will review our targets and sustainability framework from time to time, which may result in amendments in the future. Newmont may choose to adopt more ambitious targets in the future in connection with evolving best practices and market demand, which may be increasingly challenging and costly to achieve. Additionally, the methodologies that we use to calculate our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions may change over time based upon changing industry standards, which may impact, positively or negatively, our ability to satisfy our targets, which could in turn adversely affect our reputation. Any major acquisition, merger, consolidation or divestiture or any series of related acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or divestitures by or involving us may impact our ability to achieve our targets and commitments. There is currently no generally accepted global definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what criteria qualify as, \u201cgreen,\u201d \u201csocial,\u201d \u201csustainable\u201d or \u201csustainability-linked\u201d (and, in addition, the requirements of any such label may evolve from time to time), and therefore no assurance is or can be given that Newmont will meet any or all investor expectations.\nOur operations are subject to a range of transitional and physical risks related to climate change.\nWe believe that climate change has the potential to impact the regions and sites in which Newmont operates. Long-term potential physical climate risks include, but are not limited to, higher temperature in all regions, higher intensity storm events in all regions, impacts to annual precipitation depending upon the latitude and proximity of the site to oceans, and more extreme heat for sites near the equator or in Australia.\nPhysical risks related to extreme weather events such as extreme rainfall, flooding, longer wet or dry seasons, increased temperatures and drought, increased precipitation and snowfall, wildfires or brushfires, or more severe storms may have financial implications for the business. For example, we experienced severe flooding in early 2017 at our Tanami mine in Australia which led to shutdown of operations for several weeks. In 2019, Tanami completed the construction of a natural gas pipeline to deliver fuel to the site to replace diesel fuel that is trucked to the site on roads that regularly flood due to increasing seasonal rainfall. Our operations in Suriname and Peru have also experienced delays in the connection with the delivery of key production supplies due to temporary flooding. Severe storm events can also result in unpermitted off-site discharges, slope instability, mine pit erosion and structural failures, tailings storage facility overtopping and other impacts, including water storage and treatment facility capacity considerations.\nSuch events can temporarily slow or halt operations due to physical damage to assets, reduced worker productivity for safety protocols on site related to extreme temperatures or lightening events, worker aviation and bus transport to or from the site, and local or global supply route disruptions that may limit transport of essential materials, chemicals and supplies , which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. Additional financial impacts could include increased capital or operating costs to increase water storage and treatment capacity, obtain or develop maintenance and monitoring technologies, increase resiliency of facilities and establish supplier climate resiliency and contingency plans.\nAn increase in frequency and duration of extreme weather conditions can be followed by extended power outages. Energy disruptions can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to production delays or additional costs to ensure business continuity through reliable sources of on-site power generation. Energy transmission and supply may be impacted by wildfires, such as those that occurred in Australia in 2020, which may interrupt electrical power transmission lines to mine sites, and that may pose risks to on site facilities and energy generators, fuel dispensing systems and supplies. In jurisdictions that rely on purchased hydroelectric power, such as in Ghana, extreme drought and extended dry seasons may impact the electric utility\u2019s water supplies needed to generate hydroelectric power purchased by the mine to run operations, which would result in higher costs and/or limit energy availability for continuity of operations as well as impact our environmental systems and processes.\nOur Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability.\nNewmont and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of certain of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure to geotechnical instability and hydrogeological impacts. As our operations are maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have experienced geotechnical failures (such as pit wall and slope failures) at some of our mines, including, without limitation, at our operations in Australia, Ghana, Peru, Canada, Colorado and at NGM, in Nevada. See also the risk factor under the heading \u201cMining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate in order to maintain operations\u201d.\nUnanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrogeological conditions, may occur. For example, seismic activity, such as seismic activity experienced at our \u00c9l\u00e9onore mine, surface or underground fires, floods, landslides and pit wall failures, can be difficult to predict. Such conditions are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. Such events may not be detected in advance.\nIn addition, Newmont has both operational (active and inactive) and closed tailings storage facilities (\"TSFs\") in a variety of climatic and geographic settings. Annually, Newmont manages and disposes more than 100 million tonnes of milled rock slurry, referred to as tailings, that are placed within engineered, surface containment facilities, or placed as structural backfill paste in underground mines. The failure of TSF embankment or a water storage dam at one of our mine sites could cause severe, and in some\ncases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. For example, in early 2019, the extractive industry experienced a large-scale tailings dam failure at an unaffiliated mine in Brazil, which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property, environmental and reputational damage. Recognizing this risk, Newmont continues to review our existing practices and worked with the International Council on Mining & Metals to develop the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (\u201cGISTM\u201d). Newmont is committed to the implementation of the GISTM and all TSFs are expected to be in conformance with the GISTM by 2025. Compliance with the GISTM remains on-going and has and may continue to result in increases to our estimated sustaining costs and closure costs for existing facilities. Despite these efforts, no assurance can be given that TSF failure events will not occur in the future.\nA geotechnical failure of a TSF, dam, or pit slope could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, regulatory actions or penalties, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs and other impacts, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. See also the risk factors under the heading \u201cWe may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining\u201d and \u201cDamage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\u201d\nOur operations may be adversely affected by rising energy prices or energy shortages.\nOur mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy. Some of our operations are in remote locations requiring long-distance transmission of power, and in some locations we compete with other companies for access to third party power generators or electrical supply networks. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations.\nEnergy costs accounted for more than 15 percent of our overall operating costs in 2021, with our principal energy sources being purchased electricity, diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and coal. Increasing global demand for energy, concerns about nuclear power and the limited growth of new energy sources are affecting the price and supply of energy. A variety of factors, including higher energy usage in emerging market economies, actual and proposed taxation of carbon emissions as well as concerns surrounding unrest and potential conflict in the Middle East or elsewhere, could result in increased demand or limited supply of energy and/or sharply escalating diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and other energy prices. Availability of renewable power sources or conflicting government regulations, such as the proposed reform of the energy market in Mexico, may have an impact on our ability to meet our reduction targets with a specific timeline. Changes in energy laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, restrictions on energy supply and increased energy prices could negatively impact our operating costs and cash flow.\nAs our operations move to reduce our GHG emissions, power sources and technology at our operations will continue to be evaluated and implemented. Such transitions are likely to require capital expenditures and may result in additional costs. Certain of our operations may also become more dependent upon access to electrical power supply as certain mines advance projects aimed at the electrification of large haulage fleets. See the risk factor above under the heading \u201cOur operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy\u201d.\nOur operations are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies and subject to water-related risks.\nWe recognize the right to clean, safe water and that reliable water supplies are vital for hygiene, sanitation, livelihoods and the health of the environment. Water is also critical to our business, and the increasing pressure on water resources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our management approach. We have set annual water efficiency targets at each of our operating sites. Additionally, over the next five years, we aim to achieve ambitious long-term water stewardship actions, which integrate our operations and value chain and support collective management of water through external partnerships and collaborations. A failure to meet our water targets and/or societal or investor expectations could also result in damage to our reputation, decreased investor confidence and challenges in maintaining positive community relations, which can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAcross the globe, water is a shared and regulated resource. Newmont operates in areas where watersheds are under stress with limited supply, increasing population and water demand, and impacted water in various forms. Increasing pressure on water use may occur due to in-migration of communities and increased populations in proximity to our operations. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights, claims and contracts to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings or community negotiations relating to our water rights, claims, contracts and uses.\nWater shortages and surplus may also result from weather or climate impacts outside of the Company\u2019s control. Changes in the quantity of water, whether in excess or deficient amounts, may impact exploration and development activities, mining and processing operations, water management and treatment facilities, tailings storage facilities, closure and reclamation efforts, and may increase levels of dust in dry conditions and land erosion and slope stability in case of prolonged wet conditions. Our Pe\u00f1asquito and CC&V operations are situated in areas with high baseline water stress. CC&V in Colorado must purchase water supply from surrounding communities. Pe\u00f1asquito in Mexico takes its water supply from the Cedros Aquifer which has limited and declining yield as it is located in a dry and arid area that is prone to drought, and also is relied upon by nearby communities as a water supply for drinking water and\nagriculture. The water supply at Pe\u00f1asquito is thus subject to a significant degree of regulatory and community scrutiny, and Pe\u00f1asquito has made long-term commitments to provide safe community water supplies. Seasonality and changes in the levels of rainfall can also impact our operations. For example, at Boddington in Australia unusually severe weather and heavy rainfall at Boddington caused delays and impacted productivity the third quarter of 2021. There is also a risk at Boddington that extended below average rainfall or the occurrence of drought in southwest Australia could impact raw water supply for the site. While we have incorporated systems to address the impact of the dry season and water shortages as part of our operating plans, we can make no assurances that those systems will be sufficient to address all shortages in water supply, which could result in production and processing interruptions.\nIncreased precipitation and severe storm events may potentially impact tailings storage facilities by exceeding water management capacity, overtopping the facility, and/or undermining the geotechnical stability of the structure. Increased amounts of water may also result in flooding of mine pits, maintenance and storage facilities; or may exceed current water management and treatment capacity to store and treat water, physical conditions resulting in an unintended overflow and discharge either on or off of the mine site property. See the risk factor above under the heading \u201cOur operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy\u201d for additional information.\nLaws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in our operations, thus adversely affecting our operations. Additionally, laws, regulations and permit requirements focused on water management and discharge requirements for operations and water treatment in closure are becoming increasingly stringent. For example, at our Pe\u00f1asquito operation, regulators have asserted non-conformance of water wells and subsequent use of ground water. A failure to resolve such allegations of non-compliance with regulators could result in loss of permits and restriction of such wells, which could impact our ability to operate the site. We are also seeing increasingly stringent regulations of surface and groundwater at a number of our sites resulting in increased monitoring and potentially the need for pump back systems and treatment in the future. New requirements and regulation have resulted or may result in increased costs and could negatively impact our operating costs and cash flows in the future.\nFor more information on the Company\u2019s reclamation and remediation liabilities, see Notes 6 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the risk factor under the heading \u201cMine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.\u201d\nRisks Related to the Jurisdictions in Which We Operate\nOur operations are subject to risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions.\nExploration, development, production and mine closure activities are subject to regional, political, economic, community and other risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions, including:\n\u2022Potential instability of foreign governments and changes in government policies, including relating to or in response to changes of U.S. laws or foreign policies;\n\u2022Expropriation or nationalization of property;\n\u2022Restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to otherwise repatriate funds;\n\u2022Restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold and other metals offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts;\n\u2022Import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold, silver, copper, zinc and/or lead;\n\u2022Disadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals of judgments at foreign courts or arbitration panels against a sovereign nation within its own territory;\n\u2022Royalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of existing investment agreements, contracts of work, leases, royalties and taxes, by governmental entities, including such increases, claims and/or requests by the governments of Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Mexico, Peru, Suriname, the State of Colorado and the State of Nevada in the U.S.;\n\u2022Changes in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in changes resulting from changes in political administrations, for example NGM could be impacted by the resolutions before the State of Nevada Legislature to amend the State Constitution to increase mining taxes;\n\u2022Risk of increased taxation related to impacts to government revenue as a result of COVID-19;\n\u2022Fines, fees, and sanctions imposed for failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022Risk of loss due to inability to access our properties or operations;\n\u2022Other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned entities such as unilateral cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other mining rights;\n\u2022Delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits, mining or operating leases and other agreements and/or approvals;\n\u2022Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;\n\u2022Claims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by local or indigenous communities;\n\u2022Risk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass, blockade, local artisanal or illegal mining, theft and vandalism;\n\u2022Delays in obtaining or renewing collective bargaining or certain labor agreements;\n\u2022Disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to the rigorous laws and regulations of the U.S. or other jurisdictions, including without limitation, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Dodd-Frank Act;\n\u2022Increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located;\n\u2022Increased financing costs;\n\u2022Currency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high inflation;\n\u2022Foreign exchange controls;\n\u2022Increases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping, such as in relation to our Boddington operation where use of alternative ports is not currently economical, or in relation to our ability to procure economically feasible ports for developing projects;\n\u2022Risk of disruption, damage or failure of information technology systems, and risk of loss and operational delays due to impacts to operational technology systems, such as due to cyber-attacks, malicious software computer viruses, security breaches, design failures and natural disasters;\n\u2022Risk of loss due to disease, such as malaria or the zika virus, and other potential medical endemic or pandemic issues, such as Ebola or COVID-19, as a result of the potential related impact to employees, disruption to operations, supply chain delays, trade restrictions and impact on economic activity in affected countries or regions; and\n\u2022Disadvantage and risk of loss due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain diseases and potential endemic health issues.\nConsequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nNew legislation and tax risks in certain operating jurisdictions could negatively affect us.\nWe have operations and conduct business in a number of jurisdictions, which may increase our susceptibility to sudden tax changes. For instance, a 12% export duty was imposed by the Argentine government in 2018, revised down to 8% thereafter, which could affect our Argentine operations. In the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, a new local procurement law was passed requiring extractive industries to procure at least 50% of their goods and services from registered local providers, which could further impact our operational results. In the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, environmental taxes became effective in 2017 with little direction as to how the taxes are to be calculated, which required the Company, along with other companies in the State of Zacatecas, to engage with governmental authorities to understand how the environmental tax would be levied. Also, in Mexico, a 2021 tax reform bill proposed federal fees on revenue generated from mining which could impact our operations if passed. Furthermore, a new Economic Plan for 2022 (the \"Proposal\") was enacted. While the changes under the Proposal are not substantive in nature (in the sense that they do not create new taxes or increase applicable rates), they may increase the future cost of our compliance and pose additional uncertainties in application of the law. In the United States, at the federal and state level, regulatory changes which may be implemented in the area of tax reform remain uncertain and may adversely affect companies in the mining sector. For example, NGM could be impacted by the resolutions before the State of Nevada Legislature to amend the State Constitution to increase mining taxes. An example of this was the passing of Assembly Bill 495 that results in a new excise tax on mining companies engaged in the business of extracting gold and silver in the state of Nevada. Taxation laws and other regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate are complex, subject to varying interpretations and applications by the relevant tax authorities and subject to changes and revisions in the ordinary course. It is difficult to predict whether proposed changes to regulations will be passed or to what extend they will impact the Company. Any additional and/or unexpected taxes imposed on us could have a material and adverse impact on our Company. See also the risk factor under the heading \u201cOur operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy\u201d for a discussion of uncertainties and potential tax increases in connection with climate change considerations.\nChanges in mining or investment policies or shifts in political and social attitudes in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our operations or profitability.\nOur operations may be affected in a number of ways by laws and regulations related, but not limited to: restrictions on production; price controls; export controls; import restrictions, such as restrictions applicable to, among other things, equipment, services and supplies, currency remittance, income taxes, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of mineral claims, environmental legislation, land use, surface land access, land claims of local communities, water use, and mine safety. Failure to comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as partners with carried or other interests, any of which may adversely affect our operations or profitability.\nIn addition, as governments continue to struggle with deficits and concerns over the potential and actual effects of depressed economic conditions (including in connection with COVID-19 impacts), many of them have targeted the mining and metals sector in order to raise revenue. Governments are continually assessing the fiscal terms of the economic rent for a mining company to exploit resources in their countries. Numerous countries have implemented changes to their mining regimes that reflect increased government control over or participation in the mining sector, including, but not limited to, changes of law affecting foreign ownership and takeovers, mandatory government participation in mining enterprises, taxation and royalties, working conditions, rates of exchange, exchange controls, exploration licensing, export duties, repatriation of income or return of capital, environmental protection, as well as requirements intended to boost the local economy, including usage of local goods and employment of local and community staff or contractors, among other benefits to be provided to local residents. The effects of the various requirements and uncertainties related to the economic risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions cannot be accurately predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Some concern exists with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption, increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. We do not maintain insurance policies against political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur operations at Yanacocha and the development of our Conga project in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks.\nMinera Yanacocha S.R.L. (\u201cYanacocha\u201d), in which we own a 51.35% interest, and whose properties include the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project in Peru, has been the target of local political and community protests, some of which blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine and Conga project complexes and the City of Cajamarca in Peru and resulted in vandalism and equipment damage. While recently roadblocks and protests have diminished and focused on local political activism and labor disputes, we cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future. The recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could continue to adversely affect the Conga Project\u2019s development, other new projects in the area and the continued operation of Yanacocha.\nConstruction activities on our Conga project were suspended in 2011, at the request of Peru\u2019s central government following protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project was reviewed by independent experts in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of Conga. This review concluded that the environmental impact assessment complied with international standards and provided recommendations to improve water management. Based on the Company's internal project portfolio evaluation process, we have reprioritized other projects ahead of the Conga project, and therefore do not anticipate developing Conga in the next ten years. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the project\u2019s development timeline, we have allocated our exploration and development capital to other projects in our portfolio. As a result, the Conga project is currently in care and maintenance and we will continue to evaluate long-term options to progress development of the Conga project. Should the Company be unable to develop the Conga project or conclude that future development is not in the best interest of the business, a future impairment charge may result.\nThe prior Central Government of Peru supported responsible mining as a vehicle for the growth and future development of Peru. However, following the most recent presidential election in 2021, whether the Central government will continue to take similar positions in the future remains uncertain. In a close and contested election, Pedro Castillo was declared the president-elect of Peru in July 2021, which resulted in a period of protests, unrest and uncertainty around the political and social environment in Peru and Cajamarca. Castillo\u2019s election platform had been considered to be less supportive of mining in the past, and raised concerns with respect to foreign investment and mining. However, the Central Government\u2019s legislative priorities and agenda remain to be established. Amidst political turmoil and instability, Castillo has appointed four prime ministers since taking office, and made a number of changes to his cabinet, including ministers of mining, work and interior. Additionally, previous regional governments of Cajamarca and other political parties actively opposed certain mining projects in the past, including by protests, community demands and road blockages, which may occur again in the future. We are unable to predict the positions that will be taken by the Central or regional government and neighboring communities in the future and whether such positions or changes in law will affect current operations and new projects at Yanacocha or Conga. Risks related to mining and foreign investment under the new administration include, without limitation, risks to mining concessions, land tenure and permitting, increased taxes and royalties, nationalization of mining assets and increased labor regulations, environmental and other regulatory requirements. Any change in government positions or laws on these issues could adversely affect\nthe assets and operations of Yanacocha or Conga, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, the inability to develop Conga or operate at Yanacocha could have an adverse impact on our growth and production in the region. See also the risk factor under the heading \u201cMine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made\u201d and refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the Company\u2019s interest in Yanacocha.\nOur Merian operation in Suriname is subject to political and economic risks.\nWe hold a 75% interest in the Merian gold mine in the mid-eastern part of Suriname. Suriname has experienced political instability and uncertainty in the past which may continue in future years. Suriname is faced with high debts to foreign creditors, significant inflation rates and is expected to become a hyperinflationary economy. Significant devaluation of the Surinamese dollar against the US dollar in recent years has resulted in an increase of the prices of certain goods and services within Suriname, including without limitation, the price of fuel, which had been subsidized by successive governments. These impacts and negative economic trends can cause social unrest, which may present risks for our operations in Suriname.\nOperations and development in Suriname are governed by a mineral agreement with the Republic of Suriname. The mineral agreement was approved by parliament and requires approval by parliament to change. While the government is generally considered by the Company to be mining friendly, it is possible that the current or future government may adopt substantially different policies, make changes in taxation treatment or regulations, take arbitrary action which might halt operations, increase costs, or otherwise impact mining and exploration rights and/or permits, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and/or financial condition. For example, the temporary solidarity levy increases the corporate tax rate in Suriname by 10% and VAT rate by 2% in 2021 and did not apply due to the terms of the mineral agreement. However, it is possible that the government may request changes to the mineral agreement in the future.\nThe government of Suriname previously exercised an option to participate in a fully-funded 25 percent equity ownership stake in Merian. Suriname manages its participation through Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. (\u201cStaatsolie\u201d), a Surinamese corporation with the Republic of Suriname as sole shareholder. If Staatsolie does not have sufficient funds or borrowing ability to make their capital commitments in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement our operations in Suriname could be impacted. See the risk factor under the heading \u201cFuture funding requirements may affect our business, our ability to pay cash dividends or our ability to engage in share repurchase transactions.\u201d earlier in this section under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business\u201d.\nOur operations at Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana are subject to political, economic and other risks.\nNewmont operates in Ghana pursuant to a Revised Investment Agreement ratified by Ghana\u2019s Parliament in 2015, which established a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for Newmont operations in Ghana, to 2025 for Ahafo and 2027 for Akyem. However, since early 2018, and to address budgetary pressures, the Government of Ghana has initiated measures to mobilize additional revenue from the mining industry and other sectors of the economy as it attempts to increase revenue collection through various tax investigations, proposed new fees and other vehicles. There has been an increase in anti-mining sentiment in Ghana on the back of claims of the industry is not contributing its fair share to national development. These events may result in government claims that extra revenue is owed them by the Company and other mining companies operating in Ghana, resulting in increased revenue and tax initiatives. Additionally, the government may grant artisanal mining rights or alternative mining rights, such as sand and gravel, in locations in which the Company has land rights, but no active operations, impacting the Company\u2019s non-operational land positions.\nOur operations in Argentina are susceptible to risk as a result of economic and political instability in Argentina and labor unrest.\nThere continue to be risks relating to the uncertain and unpredictable political and economic environment in Argentina, especially at the provincial level in Santa Cruz where our Cerro Negro mine is located. Inflation remains a challenge in Argentina and Argentina\u2019s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in 2019 and 2020 in an effort to stabilize the local currency. For information on Argentina\u2019s foreign currency controls and their effect on our operations, see the section titled \u201cForeign Currency Exchange Rates\u201d in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Maintaining operating revenues in Argentine pesos could expose us to the risks of peso devaluation and high domestic inflation.\nIn recent years, we experienced work stoppages by miners represented by unions at the Cerro Negro Mine. Disruptions may arise again in the future with the unions at the Cerro Negro mine or with the local communities and unions that could adversely affect access to, and operations at, the Cerro Negro Mine.\nRisks Related to Our Workforce\nOur business depends on good relations with our employees.\nProduction at our mines is dependent upon the efforts of our employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good relationships with our employees. Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could experience labor disputes, work stops or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us. For example, in recent years, there have been work stoppages by miners\nrepresented by unions at our Cerro Negro, Merian and Akyem mines, which have disrupted operations. At December 31, 2021, various unions represented approximately 39% of our employee workforce worldwide. The terms and conditions contained in our Ghanaian collective agreements are agreed through December 2022. In Peru, our two labor agreements expire in March 2022 and March 2023. In Suriname, the previous labor agreement held with the union for our Merian mine expired in 2021, and negotiations remain on-going. In Timmins, Ontario, we renegotiated a three-year collective bargaining agreement for our Porcupine mine with the United Steelworkers Union which will be in effect through October 2023. In Mexico, the collective bargaining agreement for Pe\u00f1asquito was renewed in 2020 for two years, and expires in mid-2022. Although we currently have a stable relationship with the workers and the union, a strike in 2013 temporarily stopped the operation of the mine, the possibility of future disruptions in the evolving geopolitical and legal context remains a future risk. Similarly, union activities at the Company\u2019s joint ventures such as NGM in Nevada, could impact financial performance. A failure to successfully enter into new contracts or resolve ongoing union complaints could result in future labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Future disputes at the Company\u2019s operations, projects or joint ventures may not be resolved without disruptions.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, we are dependent upon our employees being able to perform their jobs in a safe and respectful work environment.\nWe depend upon the services of a number of key executives and management personnel. Our success is also dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. Our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse personnel to execute on our strategy. We are fundamentally committed to creating and maintaining a work environment in which employees are treated fairly, with dignity, decency, respect and in accordance with all applicable laws. We recognize that bullying, sexual harassment and harassment based on other protected categories, including race, have been prevalent in every industry, including the mining industry. Features of the mining industry, such as being a historically hierarchical and male-dominated culture, create risk factors for harmful workplace behavior. While we do not tolerate discrimination and harassment of any kind (including but not limited to sexual, gender identity, race, religion, ethnicity, age, or disability, among others), our policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential harmful workplace behaviors. We occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in harmful behaviors and improper, inappropriate or unlawful conduct, including but not limited to bullying, discrimination and harassment. If the Company fails to maintain a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment, it could impact our ability to retain talent and maintain a diverse workforce and damage the Company\u2019s reputation. There continues to be competition over highly skilled personnel in our industry. If we lose key personnel, or one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse employees, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nOur business is dependent upon our workforce being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness. If we experience periods where our employees are unable to perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness (such as COVID-19), our operations could be adversely affected. See the risk factor under the heading \u201cOur operations and business have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be materially and adversely impacted in the future.\u201d In addition to physical safety, protecting the psychological safety of our employees is necessary to maintaining a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment. If the Company fails to maintain a safe environment that is free of harassment, discrimination or bullying, it could adversely impact employee engagement, performance and productivity, result in potential legal claims and/or damage the Company\u2019s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or adversely affect the Company\u2019s market value. See also the risk factor under the heading \"Damage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\u201d\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.\nA significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u2022Negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;\n\u2022New legislation limiting or altering the ability to utilize contractors or outsourced resources;\n\u2022The inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n\u2022Reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n\u2022Failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n\u2022Interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n\u2022Failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and\n\u2022Problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues;\n\u2022Liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors.\nIn addition, law and regulations relating to the use of contractors may vary in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and changes in legal and regulatory restrictions may also impact our ability to utilize contractors and outsourcing services. For example, new mining industry regulations recently came into effect in Ghana, Africa, which require that the supply of specific products and services, and certain roles, be reserved for citizens, which may limit the pool of available contractors and service providers and restrict our ability to utilize certain contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nLegal Risks\nOur business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other extraterritorial and domestic anti-bribery laws and regulations, a breach or violation of which could lead to substantial sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, litigation, loss of licenses or permits and other collateral consequences and reputational harm.\nWe operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws and heightened expectations of enforcement authorities may be in tension with certain local customs and practices. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws with extraterritorial reach, including the U.K. Bribery Act, and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. We have a business integrity and compliance program which includes our Code of Conduct, Business Integrity Policy and other policies and standards, all of which mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws by the Company and its affiliates and their personnel, and also by third parties when they are engaged on our behalf. Our program also includes a well-publicized helpline for raising complaints, questions and concerns as well as processes for evaluating and investigating such concerns and assurances of non-retaliation for persons who raise concerns in good faith. We report regularly to the executive leadership team and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on such programs and the results of investigations conducted.\nWe could be held responsible if our internal control policies and procedures fail to protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, regulations and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the our affiliates, employees, agents or associated persons for which we might be claimed to be responsible. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. In addition, the compliance mechanisms and monitoring programs adopted and implemented by Goldcorp prior to our acquisition of Goldcorp in April 2019 may not have adequately prevented or detected possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act (Canada) attributable to Goldcorp prior to our acquisition of Goldcorp and we may be held liable for any such violations. We occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in improper or unlawful conduct for which we might be held responsible. Our policy when receiving credible information or allegations is to conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to evaluate that information, determine compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations and company policies and take such remedial steps as may be warranted. In appropriate circumstances, we communicate with authorities in the United States and elsewhere about those investigations and reviews. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to substantial sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, litigation, loss of operating licenses or permits and other collateral consequences, and may damage the Company\u2019s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nTitle to some of our properties may be insufficient, defective, or challenged.\nThe sufficiency or validity of the Company's rights, titles, or interests in and to its properties (\"Legal Title\") may be uncertain or challenged by third parties, including governmental authorities, Indigenous or communal peoples, or private parties. For example, at our Conga project in Peru, we continue to seek resolution to a land dispute with local residents. In Mexico, exploration and mining rights are granted through a mining concession, pertaining to the mineral estate, and do not include rights of ownership, possession, or access in or to the corresponding surface estate. Such rights in and to the surface estate are acquired through purchase, lease, or easement from private parties, local communities, or governmental authorities. We enter into temporary occupation agreements ranging from five to 30 years with the Ejido communities, which allow us to use the surface of the lands for our mining operations, and at any particular time we may be involved in negotiations to enter into new temporary occupation agreements or other surface access agreements or amend existing agreements. Failure to reach new agreements or disputes regarding existing agreements may cause, blockades, suspension of operations, delays to projects, and on occasion, may lead to legal disputes.\nIn addition, certain Australian and Canadian properties are owned by Indigenous peoples or are subject to certain inherent aboriginal rights, treaty rights, and/or asserted rights in and to their traditional territories, and our ability to acquire necessary rights to explore, develop, or mine these properties is dependent on agreements with them. Our ability to secure such agreements may be dependent on formal determinations of Indigenous or Native title rights issued by governmental authorities, the lack or delay of which may impede the Company\u2019s ability to explore, develop, or mine. In French Guiana, Ghana and Suriname, our Legal Title may be subject\nto challenge based on the presence and activities of artisanal miners. See the risk factor under the heading \u201cIllegal mining and artisanal mining occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties exposing such sites to security risks\u201d below for further information. A determination of insufficient or defective Legal Title or risks in connection with a challenge to our Legal Title could result in loss of Legal Title, litigation, insurance claims, the impairment, preclusion, or cessation of exploration, development, or mining operations, and potential losses affecting the Company's business as a whole.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.\nAs a publicly traded company listed on the NYSE and TSX, the market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: (i) changes in gold, and to a lesser extent, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices; (ii) operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors or our financial outlook; (iii) developments in our business or in the mining sector generally; (iv) regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; (v) the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us; (vi) announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors; (vii) our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; (viii) the perception of the Company\u2019s ESG performance and its ability to deliver on ESG commitments and expectations, including in connection with the Company's climate strategy; (ix) response to activism; and (x) changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and the COVID-19 pandemic has increased, and may continue to increase, volatility and pricing in the capital markets. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock may not receive dividends.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock. An annualized dividend payout level has not been declared by the Board of Directors, and the declaration and payment of future dividends, including future quarterly dividends, remains at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Our dividend framework is non-binding, and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend framework or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.", "PERMNO": 21207, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "NEM"}
