Investors should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. If any of the following risks or other risks which have not been identified or which we may believe are immaterial or unlikely, actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. This could cause the value of our securities to decline and holders could lose part or all of their investment. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us, our business or industry, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and the Industry\nThe results of our restructuring actions and expansion projects may not be successful and could negatively affect our production, customer lead time, product quality, labor relations and gross margins.\nSince 2012 we have repositioned the company by engaging in various operational restructuring measures and expansion projects. These repositioning efforts include a reduction of our cost structure and a realignment of our manufacturing footprint in order to move the focus of our manufacturing capacity away from paper with declining demand to paper with growing demand and from mature paper markets with limited growth to geographies experiencing higher rates of growth and paper demand. While we believe we have completed our major repositioning activities, if and when circumstances warrant we may take further actions in the future.\nOur operational restructuring measures have included or may include plant closures and workforce reductions meant to reduce or eliminate excess manufacturing capacity particularly for graphical grades of paper. These measures have caused or will cause us to incur significant costs. We may be unsuccessful in fully realizing the benefits of these cost reduction efforts. For instance, our profitability may decline if our restructuring efforts do not sufficiently reduce our future costs while at the same time positioning us to maintain or increase our sales and gross margins.\nIn addition, these restructuring measures may result in operational disruptions such as delays or failures in the transition of production from a closed facility to our other facilities or our inability to meet customer demand with our remaining manufacturing facilities and strains in our labor relations. For instance, if we must operate our remaining manufacturing facilities at capacity for long periods in order to meet customer demand, we may experience increased equipment failures or other reliability problems, which may result in production shutdowns or periods of reduced production. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, insufficient manufacturing capacity or other delays may cause our customer order times to increase and our product quality to decrease, which may increase warranty costs and negatively affect customer demand for our products and customer relations generally. Operating our facilities at or near capacity may also negatively affect relations with our employees, which could result in higher employee turnover, labor disputes and other disruptions in our operations. On the other hand, if we anticipate or experience a significant decrease in demand for our products, we may choose to temporarily decrease production or idle manufacturing facilities and employees. While decreasing production may mitigate some of the risks of operating at or near capacity discussed above, a significant drop off in production to meet lower demand, including idling facilities or employees, may negatively impact our gross margin.\nOur expansion projects have included or may include construction of new facilities and significant expansions of existing facilities to meet perceived growth opportunities or to relocate production from high cost regions to lower cost regions. The completion and ramp up of these projects is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which may be beyond our control. For instance, we may experience significant delays in obtaining appropriate permits or encounter unanticipated complications with the installation and implementation of systems and equipment. We also may be unable to attract a sufficient number of skilled workers to meet the needs of the new or expanded facilities.\nIn addition, the cost to implement expansion projects ultimately may prove to be greater than originally anticipated. We have spent significant capital and managerial resources on these new facilities and expansions. Furthermore, our assessment of\nthe projected benefits associated with the construction of these new facilities and expansions is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions, which in turn are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties that are beyond our control. If we incur unanticipated costs in connection with our expansion projects, are not able to complete them in a timely manner or at all, or otherwise are unable to achieve the anticipated benefits from these projects, our business, results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nNew developments and trends in the paper industry, either globally or in a particular region, could cause our paper manufacturing customers to reduce production, cease operations or takes steps to extend the life of our products, each of which would adversely affect our net sales and profitability.\nBecause demand for our products has been driven primarily by the volume of paper produced on a worldwide basis, trends that affect the production level of the paper industry will impact our business and financial results.\nOne trend we have experienced, and we believe our industry in general has experienced, is a significant decline in sales to the graphical grade industry due primarily to the increased adoption of digital media. We expect such declines to continue for the foreseeable future, and unless we are successful in increasing our sales to industries other than the printing and writing and newsprint industries, such declines may adversely affect our net sales and profitability.\nIn response to these and other changes in the sector negatively affecting the demand for paper, paper producers have sought to reduce production capacity to maintain profits, and as part of these efforts, they have permanently shut down many paper-making machines or entire manufacturing facilities. Should papermakers continue to experience low levels of profitability, we would expect further consolidation among papermakers reducing the number of paper producers, and shutdowns of paper-making machines or facilities could occur (particularly in Europe and North America) until profit levels of paper producers improve. Even the global paper production growth seen in developing markets such as Asia and Latin America could be moderated by the level of industry consolidation and paper machine shutdown activity that may occur in developed markets.\nWe also have observed that paper producers are focusing on cost reduction strategies and are extending the life of roll covers and machine clothing products through additional maintenance cycles before replacing them. Market recognition of the extended life of our roll cover products negatively impacts the demand for these products. We also have seen a trend towards new paper-making machine designs that have fewer rolls, also negatively impacting the demand for our roll cover products. If we are not able to offset these negative impacts on the demand for our roll cover products with growth from new roll cover products, the sale of roll cover products in regions which we believe have high growth potential such as China, or from other sources, the volume of our roll cover sales will be adversely affected.\nPrice competition in our industry could adversely affect our gross margins and net sales.\nHistorically, we and our competitors have been able to sell machine clothing and roll cover products and services at favorable prices that reflect the value they deliver to customers. This favorable pricing has been particularly derived from our more technologically advanced products, such as forming fabrics, press felts and advanced roll covers. In the event that competition increases due to global economic conditions, overcapacity in the paper manufacturing industry, or for other reasons, we may be required to reduce our prices, which would negatively affect our gross margins and could negatively impact our net sales.\nSome of our competitors are larger, financially stronger and more established than we are and are able to bundle products, which may limit our ability to compete.\nThe paper-making consumables industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors are larger than us, have greater financial and other resources and are well-established suppliers to the markets we serve. For example, while we have recently expanded our business in China, we face substantial competition from manufacturers already operating there that are more established and familiar with the Chinese marketplace. In addition, some of our competitors also manufacture paper-making machines and have the ability to initially package sales of their machine clothing and roll cover products with the sale of their machines and/or to tie the warranties on their machines to the use of their machine clothing and roll cover products. Due to these and other factors such as price or product innovation by our competitors, our products may not be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors, which could result in a loss of customers and, as a result, decreased net sales and profitability.\nThe loss of major customers or the shut down of a mill or mills by one of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability.\nOur top ten customers generated 27% of our net sales during 2017. The loss of one or more major customers or a substantial decrease in such customers\u2019 purchases from us, for instance through the closure of mills, could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability. Because we do not generally have binding long-term purchasing agreements with our customers, there can be no assurance that our existing customers will continue to purchase products from us.\nWe may experience supply constraints due to a limited number of suppliers of certain raw materials and equipment.\nThere are a limited number of suppliers of certain raw materials used in our machine clothing and roll cover businesses. The limited number of suppliers of these items creates the potential for disruptions in supply. Lack of supply, delivery delays, or quality problems relating to supplied raw materials could harm our production capacity, and could require us to attempt to qualify one or more additional suppliers, which could be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. Such disruptions could make it difficult to supply our customers with products on time, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEnergy price increases may negatively impact our results of operations.\nCertain of the components that we use in our manufacturing activities are petroleum-based. In addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources (including oil) in our transportation activities. Energy prices can fluctuate dramatically and significant increases could cause an increase to our raw material and transportation costs. In addition, our suppliers could pass their increased transportation costs to us and we may not be able to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without adversely affecting the demand for our products. In addition, any increase in our prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability.\nNatural disasters could disrupt our operations making it difficult for us to supply our products to customers.\nWe have production facilities that are vulnerable to flooding, storm surge, wind damage and earthquakes. In addition, our rolls and machine clothing facilities, respectively, are not capable of producing all product lines from their sister facilities. If one or more of our facilities suffered significant damage from a natural disaster, we could experience a material interruption in our operations and may be unable to timely meet our supply obligations to customers. Even if our facility does not suffer direct damage from a natural disaster or other business interruption event in an area where we have a facility, we may be affected by disruptions in local transportation and public utilities on which such locations are reliant, and our employees may also be hindered from reporting for work. Although we carry property and business interruption insurance to help mitigate the risk of property loss or business interruption that could result from the occurrence of such events, such coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all loss or damage that we may incur.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our net sales, profitability and compliance with our debt covenants.\nOur foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency devaluations. We report our financial results in U.S. Dollars, but a substantial portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in Euros and other currencies. As a result, changes in the relative values of U.S. Dollars, Euros and other currencies will affect our levels of net sales and profitability. Currency fluctuations, as they pertain to the Euro, generally have a greater effect on the level of our net sales due to the amount of business we conduct in Euros. An increase in the U.S. Dollar against the Euro generally results in a decrease to net sales and net income. Increases in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, such as the Brazilian Real, would not impact consolidated net sales as much, as a significant portion of sales in that country is denominated in or indexed to U.S. Dollars, but generally would increase net income as local currency costs would be translated into lower U.S. Dollar expenses for financial reporting purposes. We would expect a similar but opposite effect in a period in which the value of the U.S. Dollar decreases against these currencies. Although in certain circumstances we may attempt to hedge our cash exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, our hedging strategies may not be effective.\nWe may not be able to continue to innovate and improve our products to remain competitive in the market.\nWe compete primarily based on the value our products delivered to our customers. Our value proposition is based on a combination of price, technology and performance of our products, including the ability of our products to help reduce our customers\u2019 production costs and increase the quality of the products they produce. Our ability to retain our customers and increase our business depends on our ability to continually develop new, technologically superior products that support our value proposition. We cannot guarantee that our investments in technological development will be sufficient, that we will be able to create and market new products, that such new products will be accepted by our customers or that we will be successful in competing against new technologies developed by competitors. In addition, either we or our competitors could develop new technologies that increase the useful life of machine clothing or roll covers, which could reduce the frequency with which our customers would need to replace their machine clothing and refurbish or replace their roll covers, and consequently lead to reduced sales.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology, which would allow competitors or others to take advantage of our research and development efforts.\nWe rely upon trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop new products and remain competitive. If our competitors learn of our proprietary technology, they may use this information to produce products that are equivalent or superior to our products, which could reduce the net sales of our products. Our employees, consultants, and corporate collaborators may breach their obligations not to reveal our confidential information, and any remedies available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages. Even in the absence of such breaches, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known to our competitors, or be independently discovered by our competitors, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur success and ability to compete in the future may depend upon obtaining sufficient patent protection for proprietary technology.\nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents, and even if they result in issued patents, the patents may not have claims of the scope we seek. Whether or not a patent is issued, the patent applications will or may become publicly available and proprietary information disclosed in the applications will become available to others. In addition, any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or declared unenforceable. The term of any issued patent in the United States is 20 years from its filing date, and if our applications are pending for a long time period, we may have a correspondingly shorter term for any patent that may be issued. Our present and future patents may provide only limited protection for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. For example, competitors could be successful in challenging any issued patents or, alternatively, could develop similar or more advantageous technologies on their own or design around our patents. Also, patent protection in certain foreign countries may not be available or may be limited in scope and any patents obtained may not be as readily enforceable as in the United States, making it difficult for us to effectively protect our intellectual property from misuse or infringement by other companies in these countries. Our inability to obtain and enforce our intellectual property rights in some countries may harm our business. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.\nBecause we have substantial operations outside the United States, we are subject to the economic and political conditions of foreign nations.\nWe have 28 manufacturing facilities in 13 foreign countries. In 2017, we sold products in over 60 countries other than the United States, which represented approximately 67% of our net sales. Operating in foreign countries presents challenges unique to each country such as in hiring employees, our relations with various parties, including suppliers and governmental agencies, and in production.\nFurthermore, we may decide to do business in countries where we have not previously done business. In such countries, we face the additional uncertainty of entering a new market and dealing with its social customs, laws and practices. Should these challenges be realized, our operating results could be adversely impacted and our business or production may be delayed.\nOur foreign operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including risks that:\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, or the amount of any such taxes may increase;\n\u2022\nan outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur;\n\u2022\nforeign governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business; or\n\u2022\nchanges in and interpretations of policies or laws of foreign governments may adversely affect our foreign subsidiaries.\nThe occurrence of any of these conditions could disrupt our business in particular countries or regions of the world, or prevent us from conducting business in particular countries or regions, which could adversely affect our net sales and profitability. In addition, we rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations. If foreign governments impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds or impose or increase taxes on remittances or other payments to us, the amount of dividends and other distributions we receive from our subsidiaries could be reduced, which could reduce the amount of cash available to us to meet our debt obligations.\nWe may be liable for product defects or other claims relating to our products.\nOur products could be defective, fail to perform as designed or otherwise cause harm to our customers, their equipment or their products. If any of our products are defective, we may be required to recall the products and/or repair or replace them, which could result in substantial expenses and affect our profitability. Any problems with the performance of our products could harm our reputation, which could result in a loss of sales to customers and/or potential customers. In addition, if our customers believe that they have suffered harm caused by our products, such as damage to a paper-making machine, they could bring claims against us that could result in significant liability. Any claims brought against us by customers may result in:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nexpenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, expenses, and payment of damages;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products and services; and\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation.\nOur insurance may not sufficiently cover a large judgment against us or a large settlement payment, and is subject to customary deductibles, limits and exclusions.\nThe failure to minimize and mitigate cybersecurity threats could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including, for instance, intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our information technology (IT) systems. Our IT systems are, and will likely continue to be, subject to cybersecurity threats, none of which have been, individually or in the aggregate, material to the company.\nIn general, cybersecurity threats are the various methods by which a party attempts to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems. These methods include electronic hacking, phishing attacks aimed at employees or through employee oversight, error, or malfeasance. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), our IT systems could still suffer a significant breach. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could disrupt our operations and, in certain cases, the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and result in legal claims or proceedings, all of which could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur future success depends on the continued contributions of our key senior management personnel, including members of our senior sales staff and research and development team. The loss of services of any one or more of our key personnel might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could cause us to incur additional costs to recruit replacements. Each member of our executive management team may terminate his or her employment at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance with respect to any of our executives.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under laws protecting the environment and human health.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to a number of national, state and local laws and regulations protecting the environment and human health in the United States and foreign countries that govern, among other things, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, discharges of pollutants into the air and water and workplace safety. The U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, provides for responses to, and, in some instances, joint and several liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Environmental laws also hold current owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners\u2019 or operators\u2019 releases of hazardous or toxic substances, materials or wastes, pollutants or contaminants, including petroleum and petroleum products. Because of our operations, the history of industrial uses at some of our facilities, the operations of predecessor owners or operators of some of the businesses and the use and release of hazardous substances at these sites, the liability provisions of environmental laws may affect us. Many of our facilities have experienced some level of regulatory scrutiny in the past and are or may be subject to further regulatory inspections, future requests for investigation or liability for regulated materials management practices.\nWe cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to us which are designed to protect the environment and human health. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and third party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations of or\nliabilities under environmental laws, relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations or under workplace safety laws. While we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate, the adequacy of these reserves may change in the future due to new developments in particular matters.\nAdverse labor relations could harm our operations and reduce our profitability.\nWe are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because a significant portion of our workforce is unionized. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,850 employees worldwide, approximately 13% of whom were subject to protection of various North American collective bargaining agreements and approximately 54% of whom were subject to job protection as members of European or South American trade unions, employee associations or workers\u2019 councils. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 5% of the employees subject to North American collective bargaining agreements (or approximately 0.7% of our total employees) were covered by an agreement that is set to expire prior to December 31, 2018. We cannot be certain that we will be able to renew the collective bargaining agreement set to expire this year, or enter into a new collective bargaining agreement that does not adversely affect our operating results or that we will be without production interruptions, including labor stoppages. In addition, all of our European and South American employees subject to job protection as members of trade unions, employee associations or workers\u2019 councils are subject to arrangements that typically result in higher negotiated or mandated salary increases on either an annual or biannual basis. We cannot be certain that the terms of employment applicable to such employees will not change in the future in a manner which could adversely affect our operating results. We cannot be certain that we will not experience disruptions in our operations as a result of labor disputes or experience other labor relations issues. If we are unable to maintain good relations with our employees, our ability to produce our products and provide services to our customers could be reduced and/or our production costs could increase, either of which could disrupt our business and reduce our net sales and profitability.\nWe may be subject to assessment of income taxes for which we have not accrued any liability.\nWe accrue for certain known and reasonably anticipated income tax obligations after assessing the likely outcome. In the event that actual results differ from these accruals or if we become subject to a tax obligation for which we have made no accrual, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. For example, taxing authorities may disagree with our tax accounting methodologies and may subject us to inquiries regarding such taxes, which potentially could result in additional income tax assessments against us. In accordance with accounting rules, we do not accrue for potential income tax obligations if we deem a particular tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. In making our determination, we assume that the taxing authorities will have access to all relevant facts and information.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to plan for and react to changes in the economy, our industry or our business and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\nWe are significantly leveraged. As of December 31, 2017, our total indebtedness (excluding deferred financing costs) was approximately $522.0 million. Our substantial degree of leverage could have negative consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financing on attractive terms or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit our operations, capital expenditures and other business opportunities since a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our exposure to interest rate increases since certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our ABL Facility (defined in \u201cManagement Discussion & Analysis of Financial Conditions & Results of Operations & Credit Facility and Notes\u201d), are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance our debt on attractive terms or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or our ability to adjust to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less leverage; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our industry.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still incur a significant amount of additional debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of our ABL Facility and our indenture (\"Indenture\") governing our 9.50% senior secured notes due 2021 (the \"Notes\") place limits on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, we, under certain circumstances, could incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these limits. To the extent that we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our substantial leverage, including our possible inability to service our debt, would increase. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Credit Facility and Notes\u201d for a more complete description of the terms and features of the ABL Facility and the Notes.\nThe Indenture to the Notes and the ABL Facility include a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe Indenture and the ABL Facility include a number of customary and significant restrictions and covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndeclare dividends or redeem or repurchase equity interests;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or purchase debt;\n\u2022incur liens and engage in sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022make loans and investments;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements;\n\u2022engage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales;\n\u2022transact with affiliates; and\n\u2022engage in businesses that are not related to the Company's existing business.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Notes and ABL Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Notes or ABL Facility, our creditors could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the Notes and ABL Facility. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the Notes and ABL Facility. If our creditors accelerate repayment, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay the Notes and ABL Facility, or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the Notes and ABL Facility. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our future operating performance will generate sufficient cash flows to support our cash requirements. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including the ABL Facility or the Indenture. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our Indenture restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result our debt holders could declare all outstanding debt to be due and payable; the lenders under our ABL Facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money, declare all outstanding amounts there under due and payable and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in our security holders\u2019 loss of their investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nWe do not anticipate paying a dividend on our common stock in the foreseeable future, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur ABL Facility and the Indenture governing our Notes limits the payment of dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. The lack of dividend payments may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile.\nShares of our common stock may continue to experience substantial price volatility, including significant decreases, in response to a number of events, including:\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning our business;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock and/or changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nactions of competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by principal stockholders;\n\u2022\nissuances of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. and foreign government regulation;\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, terrorist attacks and acts of war.\nOn December 29, 2017, the last trading day in 2017, the closing price of our common stock was $4.26 as compared with $5.62 as of December 30, 2016. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the lowest trading price of our common stock was $3.76 and the highest trading price was $7.54.\nSome companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them. Such lawsuits, should they be filed against us in the future, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain shareholders have significant influence over our business and significant transactions.\nWe have a director nomination agreement with Carl Marks Strategic Investments, LP (together with its affiliates, \"Carl Marks\") pursuant to which Carl Marks may designate one individual for nomination to our Board of Directors, so long as Carl Marks continues to own at least 50% of the common stock issued to it under the plan of reorganization in connection with our bankruptcy in 2010. As of February 28, 2018, Carl Marks owned 13.0% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. James F. Wilson, who is a general partner of Carl Marks Management Company, is also our Chairman of the Board. As a result, Carl Marks has a strong ability to influence our business, policies and affairs, and we cannot be certain that its interests will be consistent with the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock (of which 20,000 shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.\nThe rights of the holders of our common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. For instance, we previously adopted a shareholder rights plan, which has since lapsed, that if implemented could have substantially diluted the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors could choose to adopt a stockholder rights plan in the future that may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us (or a\nsignificant percentage of our outstanding capital stock) without first negotiating with our Board of Directors regarding that acquisition.\nFurther, some provisions of our charter documents, including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock. In addition, our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting, which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors. Further, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prohibit us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if such combination is favored by a majority of stockholders, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.\nIf securities or industry analysts downgrade our common shares or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common shares is influenced in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts downgrades our shares or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our shares could decrease, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of our internal controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. We are required to provide reliable financial statements and reports to our shareholders. To monitor the accuracy and reliability of our financial reporting, we have established an internal audit function that oversees our internal controls. In addition, we have developed policies and procedures with respect to company-wide business processes and cycles in order to implement effective internal control over financial reporting. While we have undertaken substantial work to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining effective internal control over our financial reporting and may determine in the future that our existing internal controls need improvement. If we fail to comply with proper overall controls, we could be materially harmed or fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, the existence of a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal controls could result in errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in increased costs to remediate any deficiencies, attract regulatory scrutiny or lawsuits and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a substantial decline in the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90700, "SIC": 3550, "TIC": "XRM"}
