{"cik": "110471", "company": "WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nChanges in general economic conditions and other factors affecting consumer spending could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales, costs, operating results or financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s operations depend on factors affecting consumer disposable income and spending patterns. These factors include general economic conditions, employment rates, business conditions, interest rates and tax policy in each of the markets and regions in which the Company or its third-party distributors and licensees operates. Customers may defer or cancel purchases of the Company\u2019s products due to uncertainty about global economic conditions. Disposable income and consumer spending may decline due to recessionary economic cycles, high interest rates on consumer or business borrowings, restricted credit availability, inflation, high levels of unemployment or consumer debt, high tax rates, declines in consumer confidence or other factors. A decline in disposable income and consumer spending could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company operates in competitive industries and markets.\nThe Company competes with a large number of wholesalers, and retailers of footwear and apparel, and consumer-direct footwear and apparel companies. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater resources and larger customer and consumer bases, are able to sell their products at lower prices, or have greater financial, technical or marketing resources than the Company, particularly its competitors in the apparel and consumer-direct businesses. The Company\u2019s competitors may own more recognized brands; implement more effective marketing campaigns; adopt more aggressive pricing policies; make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers; or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences. The Company\u2019s continued ability to sell its products at competitive prices and to meet shifts in consumer preferences will affect its future sales. If the Company is unable to respond effectively to competitive pressures, its results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain its brands\u2019 positive images with consumers or anticipate, understand and respond to changing footwear and apparel trends and consumer preferences.\nConsumer preferences and, as a result, the popularity of particular designs and categories of footwear and apparel, generally change over time. The Company\u2019s success depends in part on its ability to maintain its brands\u2019 positive images, and the ability to anticipate, understand and respond to changing footwear and apparel trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. The Company\u2019s efforts to maintain and improve its competitive position by monitoring and timely and appropriately responding to changes in consumer preferences, increasing brand awareness, gaining sourcing efficiencies, and enhancing the style, comfort and perceived value of its products may not be successful. If the Company is unable to maintain or enhance the images of its brands or if it is unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and evolving footwear and apparel trends, consumers may consider its brands\u2019 images to be outdated, associate its brands with styles that are no longer popular and decrease demand for its products. Such failures could result in reduced sales, excess inventory, trade name impairments, lower gross margin and adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results depend on effectively managing inventory levels.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to effectively manage its inventories and accurately forecast demand are important factors in its operations. Inventory shortages can impede the Company\u2019s ability to meet demand, adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers and, consequently, adversely affect business relationships with retail customers, diminish brand loyalty and decrease sales.\nConversely, excess inventory can result in lower gross margins if the Company lowers prices in order to liquidate it. In addition, inventory may become obsolete as a result of changes in consumer preferences over time. The Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected if it is unable to effectively manage its inventory.\nIncreases or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs and other trade restrictions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales and profitability.\nAll of the Company\u2019s products manufactured overseas and imported into the U.S., Canada, the European Union and other countries are subject to customs duties collected by customs authorities. The customs information submitted by the Company is routinely subject to review by customs authorities and any such review might result in the assessment of additional duties or penalties. Additional U.S. or foreign customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions, the loss of most favored nation trading status or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of the Company\u2019s products in the future. The imposition of such costs or restrictions in countries where the Company operates, as well as in countries where its third-party distributors and licensees operate, could result in increases in the cost of the Company\u2019s products generally and adversely affect its sales and profitability.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may impact the Company\u2019s financial results positively or negatively in any given period, which may make it difficult to compare the Company\u2019s operating results from different periods. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties that manufacture the Company\u2019s products by increasing their costs of production and raw materials and making such costs more difficult to finance, thereby raising prices for the Company, its distributors and its licensees. The Company\u2019s hedging strategy may not successfully mitigate the Company\u2019s foreign currency exchange rate risk. For a more detailed discussion of the risks related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see Item 7A: \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nIn addition, our foreign subsidiaries purchase products in U.S. dollars and the cost of those products will vary depending on the applicable foreign currency exchange rate, which will impact the price charged to customers. The Company\u2019s foreign distributors also purchase products in U.S. dollars and sell in local currencies, which impacts the price to foreign consumers and in turn, impacts the amount of royalties paid to the Company in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies, the Company's revenues and profits are reduced when converted into U.S. dollars and the Company's margins may be negatively impacted by the increase in product costs. Although the Company typically has sought to mitigate the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through price increases and further actions to reduce costs, the Company may not be able to fully offset the impact, if at all. The Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on its ability to manage these various foreign currency impacts as changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nSignificant capacity constraints, production disruptions, quality issues, price increases and other risks associated with foreign sourcing could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation.\nThe Company currently sources a substantial majority of its products from third-party manufacturers in foreign countries, predominantly in the Asia Pacific region. As is common in the footwear and apparel industry, the Company does not have long-term contracts with its third-party manufacturers. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience difficulties with such manufacturers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, failures to meet production deadlines, failure to make products that meet applicable quality standards, or increases in manufacturing costs. The Company\u2019s future results depend partly on its ability to maintain its relationships with third-party manufacturers.\nForeign manufacturing is subject to a number of risks, including work stoppages, transportation delays and interruptions, political instability, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changing economic conditions, expropriation, nationalization, the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers and changes in governmental policies. Various factors could significantly interfere with the Company\u2019s ability to source its products, including adverse developments in trade or political relations with China or other countries where it sources its products, or a shift in these countries' manufacturing capacities away from footwear and apparel to other industries. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position and, in particular, on the Company\u2019s ability to meet customer demands and produce its products in a cost-effective manner.\nIncreases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to competitively price its products and, as a result, its operating results are dependent on the prices of commodities, such as cotton, leather, rubber, petroleum, cattle, pigskin hides, and other raw materials, used to make and transport its products, as well as the prices of equipment, labor, insurance and health care. The cost of commodities, equipment, services and materials is subject to change based on availability and general economic and market conditions that are difficult to predict. Various conditions, such as diseases affecting the availability of leather, affect the cost of the footwear marketed by the Company.\nIncreases in costs for commodities, equipment, services and materials used in production could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company purchases pigskin hides for its leathers operations from a single domestic source pursuant to short-term contracts. If this source fails to continue to supply the Company with raw pigskin or supplies the Company with raw pigskin on less favorable terms, the Company\u2019s cost of raw materials for its leathers operations could increase and, as a result, have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nLabor disruptions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its ability to source and distribute products in a timely and cost-effective manner. Labor disputes at or that affect independent factories where the Company\u2019s goods are produced, shipping ports, such as the 2015 labor dispute at west coast U.S. ports, tanneries, transportation carriers, retail stores or distribution centers create significant risks for the Company\u2019s business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, stoppages, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions. Any such disruption may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business by potentially resulting in inventory shortages, delayed or canceled orders by customers and unanticipated inventory accumulation, and may negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nA significant reduction in wholesale customer purchases of the Company\u2019s products, wholesale customers seeking more favorable terms or failure of wholesale customers to pay for the Company\u2019s products in a timely manner could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s financial success is directly dependent on its wholesale customers continuing to purchase its products. The Company does not typically have long-term contracts with its wholesale customers. Sales to the Company\u2019s wholesale customers are generally on an order-to-order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by the wholesale customers. Failure to fill wholesale customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner could harm the Company\u2019s relationships with its wholesale customers. Furthermore, if any of the Company\u2019s major wholesale customers experiences a significant downturn in its business, or fails to remain committed to the Company\u2019s products or brands, these wholesale customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from the Company, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company sells its products to wholesale customers and extends credit based on an evaluation of each wholesale customer\u2019s financial condition. The financial difficulties of a wholesale customer could cause the Company to stop doing business with that wholesale customer or reduce its business with that wholesale customer. The Company\u2019s inability to collect from its wholesale customers or a cessation or reduction of sales to certain wholesale customers because of credit concerns could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position.\nRetail consolidation could lead to fewer wholesale customers, wholesale customers seeking more favorable price, payment or other terms from the Company and a decrease in the number of stores that carry the Company\u2019s products. In addition, changes in the channels of distribution, such as the continued growth of eCommerce and related competitive pressures, and the sale of private label products by major retailers, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company has been awarded a number of U.S. Department of Defense contracts that include future purchase options for Bates\u00ae footwear. The U.S. Department of Defense is not obligated to exercise these future purchase options for Bates\u00ae footwear or to solicit future footwear awards at levels consistent with historical awards or in a manner in which the Company, as a large business contractor under Small Business Administration rules, is eligible to bid. Failure by the U.S. Department of Defense to exercise purchase options or the Company\u2019s failure to secure future U.S. Department of Defense contracts could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s consumer-direct operations have required, and will continue to require, a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company\u2019s consumer-direct operations, including its brick and mortar locations as well as its eCommerce and mobile channels, have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company has also made substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s brick and mortar consumer-direct operations, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and employee-related costs. The success of our consumer-direct operations also depends on the Company\u2019s ability to identify and adapt to changes in consumer spending patterns and retail shopping preferences, including the shift from brick and mortar to eCommerce and mobile channels, reductions in mall traffic, and the Company\u2019s ability to effectively develop its eCommerce and mobile channels. The Company\u2019s failure to successfully respond to these factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s consumer-direct business, as well as damage its reputation and brands, and could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nExpanding the Company\u2019s brands into new markets and product categories and re-aligning its consumer-direct operations may be difficult and costly, and unsuccessful efforts to do so may adversely affect the Company\u2019s brands and business.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s growth strategy, it seeks to enhance the positioning of its brands, to extend its brands into complementary product categories and to expand geographically. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully implement any or all of these growth strategies, and unsuccessful efforts to do so could have an adverse effect on its results of operations and financial position.\nPart of the future growth and profitability of the Company\u2019s consumer-direct operations is significantly dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to close underperforming stores and successfully develop its eCommerce and mobile platforms. The Company cannot be sure whether its eCommerce and mobile platforms will be successful, whether it will be able to terminate existing store leases in a cost-effective manner, or whether it will recapture lost sales from closed retail store locations through its wholesale, eCommerce or mobile businesses. The closure of stores and the failure to recapture sales from closed retail store locations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and financial position.\nUnseasonable or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company markets and sells footwear and apparel suited for specific seasons, such as sandals and flats for the summer season and boots for the winter season. If the weather conditions for a particular season vary significantly from those typical for that season, such as an unusually cold and rainy summer or an unusually warm and dry winter, consumer demand for seasonally appropriate products could be adversely affected. Lower demand for seasonally appropriate products may result in excess inventory, forcing the Company to sell these products at significantly discounted prices, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Conversely, if weather conditions permit the Company to sell seasonal products early in the season, this may reduce inventory levels needed to meet customers\u2019 needs later in that same season. Consequently, the Company\u2019s results of operations are highly dependent on future weather conditions and its ability to react to changes in weather conditions.\nExtreme weather conditions can also adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position. If extreme weather events forced closures of, or disrupted operations at, distribution centers maintained by the Company or third parties, the Company could incur higher costs and experience longer lead times to distribute its products on a timely basis to the Company\u2019s retail stores, wholesale customers or eCommerce consumers. In addition, consumer traffic may be reduced as a result of extreme weather conditions and a decrease in shopping traffic could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nChanges in general economic conditions and/or the credit markets affecting our distributors, suppliers and retailers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nChanges in general economic conditions and/or the credit markets could adversely impact the Company\u2019s future results of operations and financial position. Negative trends in global economic conditions may adversely impact our third-party distributors\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to provide the Company with the materials and services it needs at the prices, terms or levels as such third-parties have historically, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to meet our consumers\u2019 demands and, in turn, our results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, if the Company\u2019s third-party distributors, suppliers and retailers are not able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, they may delay or cancel orders for the Company\u2019s products or fail to meet their obligations to the Company in a timely manner, either of which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales, cash flow and operating results.\nUnfavorable findings resulting from a government audit could subject the Company to a variety of penalties and sanctions, and could negatively impact its future revenues.\nThe U.S. government has the right to audit the Company\u2019s performance under the Company\u2019s government contracts. If an audit by the U.S. government discovers improper or illegal activities, the Company could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of the Company\u2019s contracts with the U.S. government, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government or any of its agencies. The Company could also suffer serious harm to its reputation if the U.S. government alleges that the Company acted in an improper or illegal manner, whether or not any such allegations have merit. If, as the result of an audit by the U.S. government or for any other reason, the Company is suspended or barred from contracting with the U.S. government generally, or any of its agencies, if the Company\u2019s reputation or relationship with government agencies is impaired, or if the U.S. government otherwise ceases doing business with the Company or significantly decreases the amount of business it does with the Company, the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability would decrease. The Company is also subject to customs and other audits in various jurisdictions where it operates. Negative audit findings in foreign jurisdictions similarly could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nAn increase in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate or negative determinations by domestic or foreign tax authorities could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nA significant amount of the Company\u2019s earnings are generated by its Canadian, European and Asia Pacific subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, in jurisdictions that are not subject to income tax. As a result, the Company\u2019s income tax expense has historically differed from the tax computed at the U.S. statutory income tax rate due to discrete items and because the Company does not provide for U.S. taxes on earnings it considers to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations. The Company\u2019s future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company generates income; changes in, or in the interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company does business; decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates; or if the Company repatriates foreign earnings (or if U.S. tax laws change to tax foreign earnings) for which no provision for U.S. taxes has previously been made. An increase in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes and establishes reserves for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nFailure of the Company\u2019s third-party licensees and distributors to meet sales goals or to make timely payments on amounts owed to the Company could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nIn many international markets, independent third-party licensees or distributors sell the Company\u2019s products. Failure by the Company\u2019s licensees or distributors to meet planned annual sales goals or to make timely payments on amounts owed to the Company could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position. If a change in licensee or distributor becomes necessary, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee and the Company may experience increased costs, as well as substantial disruption and a resulting loss of sales and brand equity in the market where such licensee or distributor operates.\nThe Company\u2019s reputation and competitive position are dependent on its third-party manufacturers, distributors, licensees and others complying with applicable laws and ethical standards.\nThe Company cannot ensure that its independent contract manufacturers, third-party distributors, third-party licensees and others with which it does business comply with all applicable laws and ethical standards relating to working conditions and other matters. If a party with which the Company does business is found to have violated applicable laws or ethical standards, the Company could receive negative publicity that could damage its reputation, negatively affect the value of its brands and subject the Company to legal risks.\nIn addition, the Company relies on its third-party licensees to help preserve the value of the Company\u2019s brands. The Company\u2019s attempts to protect its brands through approval rights over design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of its licensed products may not be successful as the Company cannot completely control the use by its licensees of its licensed brands. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could adversely affect the value of such brand.\nChanges to United States tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nDuring, and following, the recent presidential election in the United States, there was discussion and commentary regarding potential significant changes to United States trade policies, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs regarding China as well as a disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products. The Company does a significant amount of business in the Asia Pacific region. The results of the presidential election have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and countries in the Asia Pacific region. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and affect our strategy in the Asia Pacific region and elsewhere around the world.\nGlobal political and economic uncertainty could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s products are marketed in approximately 200 countries and territories, and the Company sources a substantial majority of its products from foreign countries. Concerns regarding acts of terrorism or regional and international conflicts have created significant global economic and political uncertainties that may have material and adverse effects on consumer demand, acceptance of U.S. brands in international markets, foreign sourcing of products, shipping and transportation, product imports and exports, and the sale of products in foreign markets, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to source, manufacture, distribute and sell its products.\nIn addition, an economic downturn, whether actual or perceived, a further decrease in economic growth rates or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook in China or any other market in which the Company operates could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, worldwide, in China or any other market in which the Company operates, or in its industry. The Company sources finished footwear and apparel from companies in China, and the recent economic slowdown in China could adversely affect sales in China and consequently, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company is also subject to risks related to doing business in developing countries and economically volatile areas. These risks include social, political and economic instability; nationalization by local governmental authorities of the Company\u2019s, its distributors\u2019, or its licensees\u2019 assets and operations; slower payment of invoices; and restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to repatriate foreign currency or receive payment of amounts owed by third-party distributors and licensees. In addition, commercial laws in these areas may not be well developed or consistently administered, and new unfavorable laws may be retroactively applied. Any of these risks could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s prospects and results of operations in these areas.\nGlobal capital markets could enter a period of severe disruption and instability, which could have a material adverse effect on debt and equity markets in the United States, which in turn could have a materially negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. and global capital markets have experienced periods of disruption characterized by the freezing of available credit, a lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant losses in the principal value of investments, the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market, the failure of major financial institutions and general volatility in the financial markets. During these periods of disruption, general economic conditions deteriorated with material and adverse consequences for the broader financial and credit markets, and the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole, and financial services firms in particular, was reduced significantly. These conditions may recur for a prolonged period of time or materially worsen in the future.\nIn addition, continuing signs of deteriorating sovereign debt conditions in numerous European countries, uncertainty arising from the June 2016 referendum vote in the United Kingdom in favor of exiting from the European Union and economic slowdown in China create uncertainty that could lead to further disruptions and instability. The Company may in the future have difficulty accessing capital, and a severe disruption in the global financial markets, deterioration in credit and financing conditions or uncertainty regarding U.S. government spending and deficit levels, European sovereign debt, Chinese economic slowdown or other global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company is unsuccessful in establishing and protecting its intellectual property, the value of its brands could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to remain competitive is dependent upon its continued ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and internationally for all of the Company\u2019s lines of business. The Company relies on a combination of trade secret, patent, trademark, copyright and other laws, license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its intellectual property rights; however, some countries\u2019 laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent U.S. laws do.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be significantly harmed if it is not able to protect its intellectual property or if a court found it to be infringing on other persons\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property lawsuits or threatened lawsuits in which the Company is involved, either as a plaintiff or as a defendant, could cost the Company a significant amount of time and money and distract management\u2019s attention from operating the Company\u2019s business. If the Company does not prevail on any intellectual property claims, then the Company may have to change its manufacturing processes, products or trade names, any of which could reduce its profitability.\nIn addition, some of the Company\u2019s branded footwear operations are operated pursuant to licensing agreements with third-party trademark owners. These agreements are subject to early termination for breach. These agreements also expire by their terms and as the agreements expire, the Company may be forced to stop selling the related products. Expiration or early termination by the\nlicensor of any of these license agreements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain executive managers and other key employees, or the loss of one or more executive managers or other key employees, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company depends on its executive management and other key employees. In the footwear, apparel and consumer-direct markets, competition for key executive talent is intense and the Company\u2019s failure to identify, attract or retain executive managers or other key employees could adversely affect its business. The Company must offer and maintain competitive compensation packages to effectively recruit and retain such individuals. Further, the loss of one or more executive managers or other key employees, or the Company\u2019s failure to successfully implement succession planning, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position.\nChanges in employment laws and regulations and other related changes may lead to higher employment and pension costs for the Company.\nChanges in employment laws and regulations and other factors could increase the Company\u2019s overall employment costs. The Company\u2019s employment costs include costs relating to health care and retirement benefits, including U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans. The annual cost of benefits can vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on pension plan assets, a change in the discount rate or mortality assumptions used to determine the annual service cost related to the defined benefit plans, a change in the method or timing of meeting pension funding obligations and the rate of health care cost inflation. Increases in the Company\u2019s overall employment and pension costs could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s marketing programs, eCommerce initiatives and use of consumer information are governed by an evolving set of laws, industry standards and enforcement trends and unfavorable changes in those laws, standards or trends, or the Company\u2019s failure to comply with existing or future laws, could substantially harm the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company collects, maintains and uses data provided to it through its online activities and other consumer interactions in its business. The Company\u2019s current and future marketing programs depend on its ability to collect, maintain and use this information, and its ability to do so is subject to certain contractual restrictions in third party contracts as well as evolving international, federal and state laws, industry standards and enforcement trends. The Company strives to comply with all applicable laws and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, may conflict with other rules or may conflict with the Company\u2019s practices. If so, the Company may suffer damage to its reputation and be subject to proceedings or actions against it by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt the Company\u2019s reputation, force it to spend significant amounts to defend its practices, distract its management, increase its costs of doing business, and result in monetary liability.\nIn addition, as data privacy and marketing laws change, the Company may incur additional costs to ensure it remains in compliance. If applicable data privacy and marketing laws become more restrictive at the federal or state level, the Company\u2019s compliance costs may increase, the Company\u2019s ability to effectively engage customers via personalized marketing may decrease, its opportunities for growth may be curtailed by its compliance capabilities or reputational harm and its potential liability for security breaches may increase.\nBecause the Company processes and transmits payment card information, the Company is subject to the Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d), and card brand operating rules (\u201cCard Rules\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security that was developed by the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. The Company is required by payment card network rules to comply with the Standard, and the Company\u2019s failure to do so may result in fines or restrictions on its ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment card network rules, the Company may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments or other assessments of its compliance with the Standard. Such activities may reveal that the Company has failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self-assessment or other test determines that the Company needs to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract the Company\u2019s management team and require it to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if the Company complies with the Standard, there is no assurance that it will be protected from a security breach. Further, changes in technology and processing procedures may result in changes in the Card Rules. Such changes may require the Company to make significant investments in operating systems and technology that may impact business. Failure to keep up with changes in technology could result in loss of business. Failure to comply with the Standard or Card Rules could result in losing certification under the PCI standards and an inability to process payments.\nDisruption of the Company\u2019s information technology systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems are critical to the operations of its business. Any interruption, unauthorized access, impairment or loss of data integrity or malfunction of these systems could severely impact the Company\u2019s business, including delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in operations. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems, or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the Company\u2019s operations. Disruption to the Company\u2019s information technology systems may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the Company\u2019s online services and preclude store transactions. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, transactions processing and financial reporting. Additionally, the Company may be materially adversely affected if it is unable to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand its technology systems.\nThe Company\u2019s and its vendors\u2019 databases containing personal information and payment card data of the Company\u2019s customers, employees and other third parties, could be breached, which could subject the Company to adverse publicity, litigation, fines and expenses. If the Company is unable to comply with bank and payment card industry standards, its operations could be adversely affected.\nThe protection of the Company\u2019s customer, associate and Company data is critically important to the Company. The Company relies on its networks, databases, systems and processes, as well as those of third parties such as vendors, to protect its proprietary information and information about its customers, employees and vendors. The Company\u2019s customers and associates have a high expectation that the Company will adequately safeguard and protect their sensitive personal information. The Company has become increasingly centralized and dependent upon automated information technology processes. In addition, a portion of the Company\u2019s business operations is conducted electronically, increasing the risk of attack or interception that could cause loss or misuse of data, system failures or disruption of operations. If unauthorized parties gain access to these networks or databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify the Company\u2019s private and sensitive third-party or employee information. Improper activities by third parties, exploitation of encryption technology, new data-hacking tools and discoveries and other events or developments may result in a future compromise or breach of the Company\u2019s networks, payment card terminals or other payment systems. In particular, the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target; accordingly, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Any failure to maintain the security of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 sensitive information, or data belonging to it or its suppliers, could put it at a competitive disadvantage, result in deterioration of its customers\u2019 confidence in it, and subject it to potential litigation, liability, fines and penalties, resulting in a possible material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to its reputation. In addition, employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data or security breaches that result in unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In such circumstances, the Company could be held liable to its customers, other parties or employees, be subject to regulatory or other actions for breaching privacy laws or failing to adequately protect such information or respond to a breach. This could result in costly investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties, operational changes and negative publicity that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and its results of operations and financial position. In addition, if the Company is unable to comply with bank and PCI security standards, it may be subject to fines, restrictions and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s consumer-direct operations.\nIf the Company encounters problems affecting its logistics and distribution systems, its ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on owned or independently operated distribution facilities to transport, warehouse and ship products to its customers. The Company\u2019s logistic and distribution systems include computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations. Therefore, its operations could be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters near its distribution centers. The Company\u2019s business interruption insurance may not adequately protect the Company from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions affecting its distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of brand image. In addition, the Company\u2019s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of products to and from the Company\u2019s distribution facilities. If the Company encounters problems affecting its distribution system, its results of operations and its ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on effective marketing, advertising and promotional programs.\nConsumer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by the Company\u2019s advertising, marketing and promotional activities, the name recognition and reputation of its brands. Although the Company uses marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract consumers through various media, including social media, database marketing and print, our competitors may spend more or use different approaches, which could provide them with a competitive advantage. The Company\u2019s promotional activity and other programs may not be effective, may be perceived negatively or could require increased expenditures, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company faces risks associated with its growth strategy and acquiring businesses.\nThe Company has expanded its products and markets in part through strategic acquisitions and it may continue to do so in the future, depending on its ability to identify and successfully pursue suitable acquisition candidates. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including risks inherent in entering new markets in which the Company may not have prior experience; potential loss of significant customers or key personnel of the acquired business; not obtaining the expected benefits; managing geographically-remote operations; and potential diversion of management\u2019s attention from other aspects of the Company\u2019s business operations. Acquisitions may also cause the Company to incur debt or result in dilutive issuances of its equity securities, write-offs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses associated with other intangible assets. The Company may not be able to obtain financing for future acquisitions on favorable terms, making any such acquisitions more expensive. Any such financing may have terms that restrict the Company\u2019s operations. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired businesses into its operations and achieve the expected benefits of any acquisitions. In addition, the Company may not consummate a potential acquisition for a variety of reasons, but it may nonetheless incur material costs in the preliminary stages of such an acquisition that it cannot recover. The failure to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or achieve the expected benefits of strategic acquisitions in the future, or consummate a potential acquisition after incurring material costs, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position.\nMaintenance and growth of the Company\u2019s business depends upon the availability of adequate capital.\nThe maintenance and growth of the Company\u2019s business depends on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends in large part on cash flow generated by the Company\u2019s business and the availability of equity and debt financing. The Company cannot provide assurance that its operations will generate positive cash flow or that it will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to finance any expansion plans.\nAn impairment of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could have an adverse material impact to the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to the Company\u2019s cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by the Company at least annually for impairment. If the carrying amounts of one or more of these assets are not recoverable based upon discounted cash flow and market-approach analyses, the carrying amounts of such assets are impaired by the estimated difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value. An impairment charge could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully implement its restructuring plans.\nOn October 6, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a realignment of the Company\u2019s consumer-direct operations (the \u201c2016 Plan\u201d). There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully realize some or all of the estimated profitability improvements or other benefits from the 2016 Plan or the 2014 Plan, the Company's recently completed realignment plan. There is also no assurance that the Company will be able to re-invest any future cost savings generated from the 2016 Plan and 2014 Plan into other initiatives or that any such investment will improve the Company\u2019s operations.\nChanges in government regulation may increase the Company\u2019s costs of compliance and failure to comply with government regulations or other standards may adversely affect its brands and business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected by changes in government and regulatory policies in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. New requirements relating to product safety and testing and new environmental requirements, as well as changes in tax laws, duties, tariffs and quotas, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to produce and market footwear at competitive prices. Failure to comply with such regulations, as well as comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, could also jeopardize the Company\u2019s reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products. Damage to the Company\u2019s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild its reputation and brand value.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to environmental and workplace safety laws and regulations, and costs or claims related to these requirements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil and water, the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, employee exposure to hazards in the workplace, and the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of hazardous materials. Failure to comply with legal requirements could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. The Company may incur investigation, remediation or other costs related to releases of hazardous materials or other environmental conditions at its currently or formerly owned or operated properties, regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by the Company or a third-party, such as a prior owner or tenant. The Company has incurred, and continues to incur, costs to address soil and groundwater contamination at some locations. If such issues become more expensive to address, or if new issues arise, they could increase the Company\u2019s expenses, generate negative publicity, or otherwise adversely affect the Company.\nThe disruption, expense and potential liability associated with existing and future litigation against the Company could adversely affect its reputation, financial position or results of operations.\nThe Company may in the course of business be named as a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to its business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial position. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and may require that the Company devote substantial resources and executive time to the defense of such proceedings.\nProvisions of Delaware law and the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prevent or delay a change in control or change in management that could be beneficial to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nProvisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as well as the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of the Company. These provisions are intended to provide the Company\u2019s Board of Directors with continuity and also serve to encourage negotiations between the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and any potential hostile acquirer. Such provisions include a Board of Directors that is classified so that only one-third of directors stand for election each year. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions that may be beneficial to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nThere are risks, including stock market volatility, inherent in owning the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe market price and volume of the Company\u2019s common stock have been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. These fluctuations may arise from general stock market conditions, the impact of risk factors described in this Item 1A on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position, or a change in opinion in the market regarding the Company\u2019s business prospects or other factors, many of which may be outside the Company\u2019s immediate control. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends also could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, and the Company or securities analysts may not accurately estimate the Company\u2019s financial results, which may result in volatility in, or a decline in, the Company's stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the following:\n\u2022\nIn the wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from major customers, who may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty.\n\u2022\nWholesale customers set the delivery schedule for shipments of the Company\u2019s products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters.\n\u2022\nOur estimated annual tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which the Company reviews and revises as necessary each quarter.\n\u2022\nOur earnings are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, changes in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, weather conditions, customer demand, consumer sentiment and currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAs a result of these specific and other general factors, the Company\u2019s operating results will vary from quarter to quarter and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors or securities analysts could cause a decrease in the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn addition, various securities analysts follow the Company\u2019s financial results and issue reports. These reports include information about the Company\u2019s historical financial results as well as the analysts\u2019 estimates of future performance. The analysts\u2019 estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from the Company\u2019s estimates or expectations. If the Company\u2019s operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, the Company\u2019s stock price could decline.\nThe Company\u2019s current level of indebtedness could adversely affect the Company by decreasing business flexibility and increasing borrowing costs.\nThe Company\u2019s current level of indebtedness could adversely affect the Company by decreasing its business flexibility and increasing its borrowing costs. The Company has debt outstanding under a senior secured credit agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) and senior notes. The Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain customary restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on the Company, including restrictions that may limit the Company\u2019s ability to engage in acts that may be in its long-term best interests. These covenants restrict the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things: incur or guarantee indebtedness; incur liens; pay dividends or repurchase stock; enter into transactions with affiliates; consummate asset sales, acquisitions or mergers; prepay certain other indebtedness; or make investments. In addition, the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests.\nThese restrictive covenants may limit the Company\u2019s ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The Company\u2019s ability to comply with any financial covenants could be materially affected by events beyond its control and there can be no assurance that the Company will satisfy any such requirements. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants, it may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants, seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce its expenditures. The Company may be unable to obtain such waivers, amendments or alternative or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows, and its ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to conduct business in new and existing international markets is subject to legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks. These include:\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations, including trade and labor restrictions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. and other countries\u2019 laws relating to foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits U.S. companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nnew tariffs or other barriers in some international markets.\nThe Company is also subject to general political and economic risks in connection with our international operations, including:\n\u2022\npolitical instability and terrorist attacks;\n\u2022\ndifferences in business culture;\n\u2022\ndifferent laws governing relationships with employees and business partners;\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.\nThe Company cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the United States or foreign countries upon the import or export of our products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have, if any, on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social or economic policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business in the future or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices.\nThe Company operates in many different international markets and could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws.\nThe FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The Company\u2019s internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Despite training and compliance programs, the Company cannot be assured that the internal control policies and procedures currently in place will always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.\nThe Company\u2019s continued expansion internationally, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of FCPA violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and result in a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 42286, "SIC": 3140, "TIC": "WWW"}
