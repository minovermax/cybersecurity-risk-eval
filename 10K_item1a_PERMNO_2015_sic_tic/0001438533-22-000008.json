RISK FACTORS\nOur business, as well as an investment in our common stock, is highly speculative in nature and involves a high degree of risk. Our securities should be purchased only by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment. Carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included herein, including the financial statements and related notes, before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, they could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In such event(s), the market price of our common stock could decline and result in a loss of part or all of your investment. Accordingly, prospective investors should carefully consider, along with other matters referred to herein, the following risk factors in evaluating our business before purchasing any shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Development of our Product Candidates\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, including sparsentan and pegtibatinase (TVT-058), which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any of our current or future product candidates, including sparsentan and pegtibatinase (TVT-058), we must subject these product candidates to extensive preclinical and clinical testing to demonstrate their safety and efficacy for humans. Clinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and may take years to complete.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical or nonclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022our preclinical or nonclinical tests or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or we may abandon projects that we expect to be promising;\n\u2022regulators may require us to conduct studies of the long-term effects associated with the use of our product candidates;\n\u2022regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022the FDA or any non-United States regulatory authority may impose conditions on us regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials or may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to institutional review boards for re-inspection due to changes in the regulatory environment;\n\u2022the number of patients required for our clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022our third-party contractors or clinical investigators may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022we might have to suspend or terminate one or more of our clinical trials if we, regulators or institutional review boards determine that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022regulators or institutional review boards may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate or we may not be able to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations; and\n\u2022the effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics.\nThese risks and uncertainties impact all of our clinical programs that we pursue and have been amplified by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as described below. We will only obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate if we can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, and in the case of foreign commercialization, to the applicable foreign regulatory authorities, in well-designed and conducted clinical trials, that our product candidates are safe and effective and otherwise meet the appropriate standards required for approval for a particular indication.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will be initiated as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten the patent protection period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates. Such delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022be delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain, marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates;\n\u2022obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended or entirely different than those indications for which we sought approval; and\n\u2022have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nIn February 2021, we announced that our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 DUPLEX Study of sparsentan in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (\u201cFSGS\u201d) achieved its pre-specified interim FSGS partial remission of proteinuria endpoint (\u201cFPRE\u201d) after 36 weeks of treatment and in August 2021, we announced that our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 PROTECT Study of sparsentan in IGA Nephropathy (\u201cIgAN\u201d) achieved its pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint after 36 weeks of treatment. Pursuant to the DUPLEX and PROTECT Study protocols, patients are to continue in a blinded manner to assess the treatment effect on eGFR slope over two years in the confirmatory endpoint analyses of the studies. Given that interim results from the studies have been publicly announced, it is possible that we may see a higher than anticipated attrition rate in one or both of these studies. To the extent that an insufficient number of patients choose to remain in either study for the full two years, it could jeopardize our ability to complete the studies and submit for full regulatory approval for sparsentan in FSGS and/or IgAN.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials in the rare diseases in which we are focused if we are unable to locate a sufficient number of eligible patients willing and able to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, as other companies and researchers may be concurrently developing therapies for the same or similar indications that we are focused on, we could face competition for a limited number of patients, investigators and clinical trial sites willing to participate in clinical trials. Our inability to enroll and maintain a sufficient number of patients for any of our current or future clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nIn January 2020, we randomized the first patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the effects of Chenodal in adult and pediatric patients with CTX. The pivotal study, known as the RESTORE study, is intended to support an NDA submission for marketing authorization of Chenodal for CTX in the United States. While Chenodal has been used as the standard of care for CTX for over three decades, it is not labeled for CTX and as such we cannot market this drug candidate for the treatment of CTX unless and until it receives FDA approval for this indication. If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of Chenodal for the treatment of CTX, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe planned eGFR data cut from the DUPLEX Study may not support accelerated approval submissions in the U.S. and/or Europe.\nIn February 2021, we announced that our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 DUPLEX Study of sparsentan in FSGS achieved its pre-specified interim FSGS partial remission of proteinuria endpoint (\u201cFPRE\u201d) after 36 weeks of treatment. The confirmatory primary endpoint of the DUPLEX Study to support full regulatory approval is the rate of change in eGFR over 108 weeks of treatment. As of the time of the interim analyses, available long-term eGFR data for the confirmatory endpoint were limited. In May 2021, we provided a regulatory update regarding the sparsentan FSGS program, including feedback from the FDA that the available data from the previously announced interim assessment of the DUPLEX Study would not be adequate to support an accelerated approval in the U.S. at this time. At a subsequent Type A meeting, we and the FDA reached alignment on a pathway for us to proceed with a submission for accelerated approval, pending additional supportive eGFR data. While we intend to provide the FDA with additional eGFR data from the ongoing DUPLEX Study in the first half of 2022, and if such data are supportive, submit an application for accelerated approval in the U.S. in mid-2022, there is no guarantee that such eGFR data will be supportive, or that the FDA will agree with our assessment as to whether it, together with the data from the previously announced interim assessment of the DUPLEX Study will be adequate to support an accelerated approval in the U.S. Similarly, we intend to provide such data to the EMA via a submission of sparsentan for FSGS, and there is no guarantee that the data will support such a submission.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. For example, although we observed favorable responses with the physician-initiated treatment of fosmetpantotenate in PKAN patients outside the United States, the Phase 3 FORT Study evaluating the safety and efficacy of fosmetpantotenate compared to placebo in patients with PKAN did not meet its primary endpoint, did not demonstrate a difference between treatment groups, and did not meet its secondary endpoint. In addition, there can be no assurance that the\npositive eGFR results from the open-label portion of the DUET study of sparsentan in FSGS will be repeated in the Phase 3 clinical trial. Similarly, the positive pre-clinical data we have seen from pegtibatinase (TVT-058) being tested in a mouse model of homocystinuria and the positive topline results we reported in December 2021 from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of pegtibatinase (TVT-058) may not be replicated in future studies. We cannot assure that any current or future clinical trials of sparsentan or pegtibatinase (TVT-058) will ultimately be successful.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive preclinical tests to demonstrate the safety of our product candidates in animals. Preclinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, and can take many years to complete. In addition, during the clinical development process, additional nonclinical toxicology studies are routinely conducted concurrently with the clinical development of a product candidate. If any of our product candidates show unexpected findings in concurrent toxicology studies, we could experience potentially significant delays in, or be required to abandon, development of that product candidate. A failure of one or more of our nonclinical studies can occur at any stage of testing.\nCommunications and/or feedback from the FDA or EMA related to our current or planned future clinical trials does not guarantee any particular outcome from regulatory review for such clinical trials.\nCommunications and/or feedback from the FDA or EMA related to our current or future clinical trials does not guarantee any particular outcome from regulatory review for such clinical trials.\nIn 2018 we initiated the following Phase 3 clinical trials of sparsentan: 1) a single Phase 3 clinical trial designed to serve as the basis for an NDA and MAA filing for sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS (the \u201cDUPLEX Study\u201d), and 2) a single Phase 3 clinical trial designed to serve as the basis for an NDA and MAA filing for sparsentan for the treatment of IgAN (the \u201cPROTECT Study\u201d). We are conducting the DUPLEX Study and the PROTECT Study under the Subpart H pathway for potential accelerated approval in the United States, and in Europe we plan to pursue potential Conditional Marketing Authorization, in both jurisdictions based on change in proteinuria. Recognition of change in proteinuria as a surrogate endpoint in kidney disease is a relatively new regulatory development, and, as the field continues to evolve, new learnings may impact regulatory viewpoints. For example, in the DUPLEX Study in conjunction with ongoing FDA dialogue to enable submission for potential approval on the subpart H pathway, in November 2020 we adopted an eGFR measurement over a 108-week period following randomized treatment, to support full approval. However, in May 2021, we received feedback from the FDA that the available data from the previously announced interim assessment of the DUPLEX Study would not be adequate to support an accelerated approval in the U.S. at this time. While we believe that we and the FDA have reached alignment on a pathway for us to proceed with a submission for accelerated approval, pending additional supportive eGFR data, additional data from the DUPLEX Study may not be sufficient to support an NDA under Subpart H for accelerated approval. For both indications, there is no guarantee that the FDA will accept the NDA for filing, as the FDA has the authority to refuse to file NDAs for a variety of reasons. Further, even if the FDA accepts the NDAs for filing, there is no guarantee that either NDA will be granted priority review during the application review process. If the application is not granted priority review, the review and potential approval timeline will extend beyond our current stated timing assumptions.\nIf the FDA or EMA agree to review our regulatory submissions for accelerated approval/conditional marketing authorization, we expect that the FDA\u2019s and EMA\u2019s determination as to whether the sufficiency of the data from the DUPLEX and PROTECT Studies supports an accelerated approval/conditional marketing authorization in either jurisdiction will be made during the application review process based on the totality of the data, including eGFR data available for review from the respective studies. There can be no assurance that the FDA or EMA will deem our achievement of any interim endpoint or measurement in the DUPLEX or PROTECT Studies to be sufficient to grant accelerated approval or Conditional Marketing Authorization for sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS or IgAN, respectively.\nThere can be no guarantee that the data generated from the DUPLEX Study will be sufficient to serve as the basis for an NDA filing, or that additional data from the DUPLEX Study will be sufficient to support an NDA under Subpart H for accelerated approval. In addition, our statistical modeling that supports proceeding with the DUPLEX Study on the Subpart H pathway is based on data from other FSGS studies. To the extent that the model population is not representative of the DUPLEX Study population, the FDA may not agree that the new results continue to support a Subpart H pathway. Furthermore, even if sparsentan is granted accelerated approval for FSGS, there can be no assurance that the post-marketing confirmatory data will support full approval of sparsentan as a treatment for FSGS.\nAlthough we have announced that our ongoing pivotal Phase 3 PROTECT Study of sparsentan in IgAN achieved its pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint after 36 weeks of treatment and we have reached alignment with the FDA on proceeding with a submission for accelerated approval of sparsentan for IgAN, there can be no assurance that the study will proceed as planned and there can be no guarantee that the data generated from the study will be sufficient to serve as the basis for an NDA filing, including an NDA under Subpart H for accelerated approval or support Conditional Marketing Authorization in the EU. Furthermore, even if sparsentan is granted accelerated approval for IgAN, there can be no assurance that the post-marketing confirmatory data will support full approval of sparsentan as a treatment for IgAN.\nIn addition, because both the DUPLEX Study and PROTECT Study are evaluating the same compound for the treatment of chronic kidney diseases and utilizing similar endpoints, the risk of success or failure for the two studies may, depending on the outcomes of the studies, end up being correlated.\nAn extended delay in the rate of enrollment or data collection in our ongoing Phase 1/2 Study of pegtibatinase (TVT-058), as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, may delay our timelines for analyzing future data from the study.\nWhile we have recently completed enrollment of the initially planned dose cohorts, we are currently enrolling an additional patient cohort in the clinical trial of pegtibatinase (TVT-058) for homocystinuria, a rare disease. Given that this development candidate is still undergoing required testing, we may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we are unable to locate a sufficient number of eligible patients willing and able to participate in the clinical trial required by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, as other companies and researchers may be concurrently developing therapies for the same or similar indications that we are focused on, we could face competition for a limited number of patients, investigators and clinical trial sites willing to participate in clinical trials. Our inability to enroll and maintain a sufficient number of patients for any of our current or future clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nIf the rate of enrollment in the ongoing Phase 1/2 Study of pegtibatinase (TVT-058) is slower than we anticipate, due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, or if there are barriers to data collection or monitoring activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our timelines for analyzing results from the Phase 1/2 Study of pegtibatinase (TVT-058) could be delayed.\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or topline or interim data from our clinical studies, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution. From time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment and dosing continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final or confirmatory data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, drug candidate or our business. If the topline data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nEven if any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, we and/or a collaborative partner will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense.\nAny regulatory approvals that any of our product candidates receives may be subject to significant limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate.\nIn addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any product candidates, those products will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements, including for the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export, recordkeeping, conduct of potential post-marketing studies and post-market submission requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current good manufacturing practices and good clinical practices, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, undesirable side effects caused by the product, problems encountered by our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, either before or after product approval, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing, manufacturing, or distribution of the product;\n\u2022requirements to include additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022requirements to create or enhance a medication guide outlining the risks to patients;\n\u2022withdrawal of the product from the market;\n\u2022voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022requirements to change the way the product is administered or for us to conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u2022fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic partners, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u2022harm to our reputation.\nFor example, we have certain post-marketing requirements and commitments associated with Cholbam. Further, we face risks relating to those post-marketing obligations, as well as the commercial acceptance of Cholbam. If the regulatory approval for Chenodal, Cholbam and/or Thiola are withdrawn for any reason, it would have a material adverse impact on our sales and profitability.\nThe independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations that we rely upon to conduct our clinical trials may not be diligent, careful or timely, and may make mistakes, in the conduct of our trials.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to conduct our clinical trials under agreements with us. The CROs play a significant role in the conduct of our clinical trials. Failure of the CROs to meet their obligations could adversely affect clinical development of our product candidates. The independent clinical investigators are not our employees and we cannot control the timing or amount of resources they devote to our studies. If their performance is substandard, it could delay or prevent approval of our FDA applications. Moreover, these independent investigators and CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If independent investigators and CROs allocate their resources to assist our competitors at our expense, it could harm our competitive position. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have engaged or intend to engage providers of home health and remote monitoring services to assist with the ongoing conduct of our clinical trials in an effort to mitigate disruption caused by COVID-19 related issues. The introduction of new third parties into our ongoing clinical trials increases the risks associated with our dependence on third parties, including the risk that substandard performance by, or competing interests of, such third parties could have a negative impact on our clinical trials. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the utilization of such home health providers or remote monitoring services will be successful in mitigating disruptions to our clinical trials caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Products\nThe commercial success of Chenodal, Cholbam and Thiola depends on them being considered to be effective drugs with advantages over other therapies.\nThe commercial success of our products Chenodal, Cholbam and Thiola depends on them being considered to be effective drugs with advantages over other therapies. A number of factors, as discussed in greater detail below, may adversely impact the degree of acceptance of these products, including their efficacy, safety, price and benefits over competing therapies, as well as the coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans.\nIf unexpected adverse events are reported in connection with the use of any of these products, physician and patient acceptance of the product could deteriorate and the commercial success of such product could be adversely affected. We are required to report to the FDA events associated with our products relating to death or injury. Adverse events could result in additional regulatory controls, such as a requirement for costly post-approval clinical studies or revisions to our approved labeling which could limit the indications or patient population for a product or could even lead to the withdrawal of a product from the market.\nWe are subject to generic competition, and recent developments relating to generic competition for pharmaceutical products could cause our product sales and business to be negatively impacted.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an ANDA, seeking approval of a generic copy of an approved innovator product or an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) that relies on the FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety and effectiveness in approving the innovator product. A Section 505(b) (2) NDA may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator product. Certain of our products, including Thiola, are subject to immediate competition from compounded and generic entrants, as the ANDA and\nNDA for these drug products have no remaining or current patent or non-patent exclusivity. In May 2021, a generic option for the 100 mg version of the original formulation of Thiola (tiopronin tablets) was approved by the FDA and additional generic alternatives may be approved in the future.\nIn addition, there have been a number of recent regulatory and legislative initiatives designed to encourage generic competition for pharmaceutical products, including expedited review procedures for generic manufacturers and incentives designed to spur generic competition of branded drugs. In particular, the FDA and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) have been focused on brand companies\u2019 denial of drug supply to potential generic competitors for testing. In December 2019, the CREATES Act was enacted, which provides a legislatively defined private right of action under which generic companies can bring suit against companies who refuse access to product for the bioequivalence testing needed to support approval of a generic product.\nWe have completed our response to a civil investigative demand from the FTC related to the marketing, sale, distribution and pricing of our products, including Thiola. While the investigation remains open, at this time the FTC has not indicated that it has additional questions for us, and has not initiated any claim or proceeding against us relating to these matters.\nWe cannot currently predict the specific outcome or impact on our business of such regulatory and legislative initiatives, litigation or investigation. However, it is our policy, which is in compliance with the CREATES Act, to evaluate requests for samples of our branded products, and to provide samples in response to bona fide requests from qualified third parties, including generic manufacturers, subject to specified conditions. We have provided and are in the process of providing samples to certain generic manufacturers.\nIf additional generic versions of Thiola, of Cholbam, or of Chenodal or any of our other current or future products are approved, sales of that product likely would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse impact on our sales and profitability. Both the original formulation of Thiola and Thiola EC are subject to generic competition, and a generic version of either formulation could have a material adverse impact on sales of Thiola EC. In addition, the defense of litigation and response to investigation requests could result in substantial costs, reputational impact, and the diversion of management attention and resources.\nChanges in reimbursement practices of third-party payers, or patients' access to insurance coverage, could affect the demand for our products and/or the prices at which they are sold.\nThe business and financial condition of healthcare-related businesses will continue to be affected by efforts of governments and third-party payers to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare through various means. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for sparsentan, pegtibatinase (TVT-058), or any other product candidate that we develop, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell sparsentan, pegtibatinase (TVT-058), or any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nOur products are sold to patients whose healthcare costs are met by third-party payers, such as government programs, private insurance plans and managed-care programs. These third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. Levels of reimbursement, if any, may be decreased in the future, and future healthcare reform legislation, regulations or changes to reimbursement policies of third-party payers may otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nEconomic, social, and congressional pressure may result in individuals and government entities increasingly seeking to achieve cost savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our products. For example, state Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization for use of drugs. Managed care organizations continue to seek price discounts and, in some cases, to impose restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products.\nIn addition, patients\u2019 access to employer sponsored insurance coverage may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or other economic factors that result in increased rates of unemployment. To the extent patients taking our approved therapies become unemployed and experience a reduction to, or increased costs associated with, their insurance coverage, demand for our products could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, either as a result of decreased sales of our products and/or increased provision by us of free product to uninsured or commercially insured patients. The extent and duration of this potential impact on our business is currently unknown.\nWe are dependent on third parties to manufacture and distribute our pharmaceutical products who may not fulfill their obligations.\nWe have no manufacturing capabilities and rely on third party manufacturers who are sole source suppliers for manufacturing of Chenodal, Cholbam and Thiola. The facilities used by our third-party manufacturers must be approved by the FDA. Our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of our products may harm our profit margin on the sale of products and our ability to deliver products on a timely and competitive basis. If our third-party manufacturers are unable to manufacture to specifications or in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, our ability to commercialize our products will be adversely impacted and could affect our ability to gain market acceptance for our products and negatively impact our revenues.\nWe currently have no in-house distribution channels for Chenodal, Cholbam or Thiola and we are dependent on a third-party distributor, Eversana, to distribute such products. We rely on this distributor for all of our proceeds from sales of Chenodal, Cholbam and Thiola in the United States. The outsourcing of our distribution function is complex, and we may experience difficulties that could reduce, delay or stop shipments of such products. If we encounter such distribution problems, and we are unable to quickly enter into a similar agreement with another distributor on substantially similar terms, distribution of Chenodal, Cholbam and/or Thiola could become disrupted, resulting in lost revenues, provider dissatisfaction, and/or patient dissatisfaction.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls and reimbursement approval policies, which may adversely affect our prospects for generating revenue.\nIn some countries, particularly EU countries and EFTA member states, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time (6 to 12 months or longer) after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. In addition, certain governmental authorities may conduct reviews of reimbursement previously provided and assert for various reasons that amounts need to be repaid. For example, in October 2021 our distributor/exploitant in France for our previously marketed product Kolbam informed us that they had received a notice that the price previously paid for Kolbam during its period on the market in France had been recalculated by the agency responsible for pharmaceutical pricing in France, with such notice asserting amounts owed for repayment. While we cannot currently estimate the likelihood that any of such asserted amount will ultimately need to be repaid following the currently ongoing review process and any applicable appeal procedures, we may ultimately determine the need to repay all or a portion of the amounts being asserted. From 2015 through 2020, the period during which we had sales of Kolbam in France, our aggregate revenues from sales of Kolbam in France attributable to all purchasers/payers were approximately $8 million. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or subject to re-assessment and recoupment procedures, our prospects for generating revenue outside of the United States, if any, could be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nWe are dependent on Vifor Pharma for the successful commercialization of sparsentan in certain key territories outside of the United States, if approved. We may not be able to establish additional collaborations or other arrangements for sparsentan in other territories, which may adversely impact our ability to generate product revenue in additional jurisdictions.\nPursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, we granted an exclusive license to Vifor Pharma for the commercialization of sparsentan in the Licensed Territories, which consist of Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Consequently, the commercial success of sparsentan in the Licensed Territories will depend in significant part on the efforts of Vifor Pharma, over which we will have limited control. In December 2021, it was announced that CSL Limited, parent company to CSL Behring, intends to initiate a tender offer to acquire Vifor Pharma. We do not currently know what effect, if any, such acquisition, if consummated, will have on our relationship with Vifor Pharma. While our agreement with Vifor Pharma provides that it will remain in place following any acquisition, there is no guarantee that our collaboration with Vifor Pharma will not be affected, adversely or otherwise, by a change in ownership of Vifor Pharma. Moreover, in connection with CSL Limited's acquisition of Vifor Pharma, if consummated, and any related restructuring, substantially less resources could be devoted to the commercialization of sparsentan in the Licensed Territories, or such efforts could be discontinued entirely. If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell sparsentan, if approved, in additional territories, our ability to generate product revenue outside of the United States and the Licensed Territories may be limited.\nWe may not be able to rely on orphan drug exclusivity for our products.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs, providing eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity upon regulatory approval if certain jurisdictional-specific conditions are met. For example, Cholbam was granted orphan drug designation in the United States and upon FDA approval of the marketing application in March 2015 was awarded seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, which expires in March 2022. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, that product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the applicable regulatory authority from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe or, in the case of orphan drugs for which a pediatric investigation plan has been completed, 12 years. Even though we have been awarded orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe for sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS and IgAN and for the pegtibatinase for the treatment of HCU, we may not be able to maintain it in Europe and the orphan drug designation may not result in orphan drug exclusivity in the United States or Europe upon approval. For example, if a competitive product that contains the same active moiety and treats the same disease as our product is shown to be clinically superior to our product, any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product and we may effectively lose orphan drug exclusivity. Similarly, if a competitive product that contains the same active moiety and treats the same disease as our product candidate is approved for orphan drug exclusivity before our product candidate, we may not be able to obtain approval for our product candidate until the expiration of the competitive product\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity unless our product candidate is shown to be clinically superior to the competitive product.\nIf we are unable to maintain an effective and specialized sales force, we will not be able to commercialize our products in the United States successfully.\nIn order to successfully commercialize our products in the United States, we have built a specialized sales force. Factors that may hinder our ability to successfully market and commercially distribute our products include:\n\u2022inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or educate adequate numbers of physicians on the benefits and safety of prescribing our products;\n\u2022inability to recruit, retain and effectively manage adequate numbers of effective sales personnel;\n\u2022lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022unforeseen delays, costs and expenses associated with maintaining our sales organization.\nIf we are unable to maintain our sales force for our products, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue in the United States. Similarly, if Vifor does not effectively engage or maintain its sales force for sparsentan, our ability to recognize milestones payments and royalties from the Licensed Territories will be adversely affected.\nWe will need to continue to expend significant time and resources to train our sales forces to be credible, persuasive and compliant in discussing our products with the specialists treating the patients indicated under the product\u2019s label. In addition, if we are unable to effectively train our sales force and equip them with effective marketing materials our ability to successfully commercialize our products could be diminished, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\nRisks Related to our Products and Product Candidates\nOur products may not achieve or maintain expected levels of market acceptance or commercial success.\nThe success of our products is dependent upon achieving and maintaining market acceptance. Commercializing products is time consuming, expensive and unpredictable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to, either by ourselves or in collaboration with our partners or through our licensees, successfully commercialize new products or current products or gain market acceptance for such products. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited or no commercial success.\nFurther, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of the affected products. Accordingly, new data about our products, or products similar to our products, could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal.\nOur current products and any products that we or a collaboration partner bring to the market, including sparsentan and pegtibatinase (TVT-058), if they receive marketing approval, may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers, and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our current products and product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022the efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u2022the pricing of our product candidates;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022the strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u2022sufficient third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement.\nEven if a potential or current product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. The efforts by us or any applicable collaboration partner to educate patients, the medical community, and third-party payers on the benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by the conventional marketing technologies employed by our competitors.\nIf the market opportunities for our products and product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our revenues may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nCertain of the diseases that our current and future product candidates are being developed to address, such as FSGS and IgAN, are relatively rare. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, may not be accurate.\nCurrently, most reported estimates of the prevalence of FSGS are based on studies of small subsets of the population of specific geographic areas, which are then extrapolated to estimate the prevalence of the diseases in the broader world population. As new studies are performed the estimated prevalence of these diseases may change. There can be no assurance that the prevalence of FSGS in the study populations accurately reflect the prevalence of these diseases in the broader world population. If our estimates of the prevalence of FSGS or IgAN or of the number of patients who may benefit from treatment with sparsentan prove to be incorrect, the market opportunities for our product candidates may be smaller than we believe they are, our prospects for generating revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, and in turn prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and generating revenues from their sale.\nAdditionally, if sparsentan receives marketing approval, we expect the FDA will require us to include a REMS and mandatory birth control for women of child-bearing age regarding risk of embryo-fetal toxicity, as has been required for other approved endothelin antagonists.\nIn addition, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require the addition of restrictive labeling statements;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product; and\n\u2022we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product candidate, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale or adversely affect our reputation.\nWe do not currently have patent protection for our commercial products. If we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property relating to our technology and products, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries for the intellectual property covering, or incorporated into, our technology and products. The patent situation in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal, technical, scientific and factual questions. We do not have, and do not expect to obtain, patent protection for Thiola, Chenodal or Cholbam. Additionally, although we have a pending U.S. patent application directed to Thiola EC and/or its use for treating cystinuria, we do not know whether this or any future patent applications will result in a granted patent covering Thiola EC or its use for treating cystinuria. More generally, we may not be able to obtain additional issued patents relating to our technology or products. Even if issued, patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or reduce the term of patent protection we may have for our products. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nOur product candidate sparsentan is covered by U.S. Patent No. 6,638,937, which expired in 2019 and to which we have an exclusive license. In addition, U.S. Patent No. 9,662,312, to which we also have an exclusive license and which was granted on May 30, 2017 and expires in 2030, covers the use of sparsentan for treating glomerulosclerosis, including FSGS. And U.S. Patent No. 9,993,461, to which we also have an exclusive\nlicense and which was granted on June 12, 2018 and expires in 2030, covers the use of sparsentan for treating IgA nephropathy as well as glomerulosclerosis, including FSGS.\nFor products we develop based on a new chemical entity not previously approved by the FDA, we expect that in addition to the protection afforded by our patent filings that we will be able to obtain five years regulatory exclusivity via the provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (\"FDC\") Act and possibly seven years regulatory exclusivity via the orphan drug provisions of the FDC Act. In the case of sparsentan, the periods of regulatory exclusivity may, if certain conditions are satisfied, be extended by six months on the basis of pediatric exclusivity, thereby resulting in exclusivity periods of 5.5 years and 7.5 years, respectively. In addition, we may be able to obtain up to five years patent term extension (to compensate for regulatory approval delay) for one patent covering such a product for its FDA-approved use. Such a patent, like the periods of regulatory exclusivity, also may be extended by a further six months on the basis of pediatric exclusivity if certain conditions are satisfied.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u2022we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022any patents issued to us or our licensors that provide a basis for commercially viable products will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022we will file patent applications for new proprietary technologies promptly or at all;\n\u2022the claims we make in our patents will be upheld by patent offices in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u2022our patents will not expire prior to or shortly after commencing commercialization of a product; and\n\u2022the patents of others will not have a negative effect on our ability to do business.\nWe have negotiated a license agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals for the rights to sparsentan which we are initially developing for the treatment of FSGS and IgAN. This license subjects us to various commercialization, reporting and other obligations. If we were to default on our obligations, we and Vifor Pharma could lose our rights to sparsentan. We have obtained a U.S. patent and European patent each covering the use of sparsentan for treating glomerulosclerosis, including FSGS, as well as a second U.S. patent and a second European patent each covering both the use of sparsentan for treating IgAN and the use of sparsentan for treating glomerulosclerosis, including FSGS. In addition, in 2020 we obtained a U.S. patent covering the use of sparsentan for the treatment of Alport syndrome. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain patent protection for various other potential indications for sparsentan, or whether, if granted, we would be able to enforce such patents. Additionally, in November 2020, a third party filed an opposition to our second European patent (European Patent No. EP3222277, \u201cthe \u2018277 EP Patent\u201d), in the European Patent Office (\"EPO\"). While we are vigorously defending the \u2018277 EP Patent against the opposition, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so.\nOur patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology. Because patent applications in the United States and many other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to make the inventions claimed in our or their issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we or they were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications. If a third party has also filed a United States patent application prior to the effective date of the relevant provisions of the America Invents Act (i.e. before March 16, 2013) covering our product candidates or a similar invention, we may have to participate in an adversarial proceeding, known as an interference, declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts could be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us with respect to technologies used in our products. If patent infringement suits were brought against us, we may be unable to commercialize some of our products which could severely harm our business. Litigation proceedings, even if not successful, could result in substantial costs and harm our business.\nWe expect to rely on orphan drug status to develop and commercialize certain of our product candidates, but our orphan drug designations may not confer marketing exclusivity or other expected commercial benefits.\nWe expect to rely on orphan drug exclusivity for sparsentan and potential future product candidates that we may develop. Orphan drug status currently confers seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States under the FDC Act, and up to ten years of marketing exclusivity in Europe for a particular product in a specified indication or, in the case of orphan drugs for which a pediatric investigation plan has been completed, 12 years. The FDA and EMA have granted orphan designation for Chenodal, sparsentan, and pegtibatinase (TVT-058) for the treatment of CTX, FSGS, IgAN and homocystinuria, respectively. While we have been granted these orphan designations, we will not be able to rely on these designations to exclude other companies from manufacturing or selling these molecules for the same indication beyond these time frames. Furthermore, in Europe, orphan drug status is re-evaluated in connection with the marketing authorization review process and a product candidate must re-qualify as of such time in order to maintain orphan drug status. In addition, any marketing exclusivity in Europe can be reduced from ten years to six years if the initial designation criteria have significantly changed since the market authorization of the orphan product.\nFor any product candidate for which we have been granted orphan drug designation in a particular indication, it is possible that another company also holding orphan drug designation for the same product candidate will receive marketing approval for the same indication before we do. If that were to happen, our applications for that indication may not be approved until the competing company's period of exclusivity expires. Even if we are the first to obtain marketing authorization for an orphan drug indication in the United States, there are circumstances under which a competing product may be approved for the same indication during the seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to our orphan product, or if the later product is deemed a different product than ours. Further, the seven-year marketing exclusivity would not prevent competitors from obtaining approval of the same product candidate as ours for indications other than those in which we have been granted orphan drug designation, or for the use of other types of products in the same indications as our orphan product.\nAny drugs we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our business.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \"PPACA\"), a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The PPACA revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. The PPACA also increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. Further, the law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. There have been executive, judicial, Congressional, and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. For example, legislation enacted in 2017 informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") includes a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (\"BBA\"), among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase the discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D from 50 percent to 70 percent, and closed the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. Thus, the PPACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the PPACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the PPACA. It is possible that the PPACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA and our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the BBA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will stay in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The COVID-19 relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of\nthis sequester. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement from governments or third-party payers for any products that we may develop or if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices for those products, our prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability will suffer.\nOur prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability will depend heavily upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for the use of our approved product candidates from governmental and other third-party payers, both in the United States and in other markets. Reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payer\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022cost-effective; and\n\u2022neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining reimbursement approval for a product from each government or other third-party payer is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payer. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to reimbursement. Additionally, we might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to such payers\u2019 satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Even when a payer determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, the payer may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the FDA or non-United States regulatory authorities. Also, prior authorization for a product may be required. In addition, there is a risk that full reimbursement may not be available for high-priced products. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows us to make a profit or even cover our costs. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Further, coverage policies and third-party payer reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nA primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is toward cost containment. We expect the changes made by PPACA, other legislation impacting the Medicare program and the 340B program, and the increasing emphasis on managed care to continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical product pricing. As these concerns continue to grow over the need for tighter oversight, there remains the possibility that the Heath Resources and Services Administration or another agency under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") will propose regulations or that Congress will explore changes to the 340B program through legislation. For example, on November 30, 2018, the U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration published its final rule regarding the calculation of 340B ceiling price and imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers for knowingly and intentionally overcharging covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. Pursuant to the final rule, after January 1, 2019, manufacturers must calculate 340B program ceiling prices on a quarterly basis. Moreover, manufacturers could be subject to a $5,000 penalty for each instance where they knowingly and intentionally overcharge a covered entity under the 340B program.\nThere have also been a number of initiatives pending at the state and federal level that could negatively impact the reimbursement for products approved under the accelerated approval pathway in the United States.\nFurther, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices, including several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, increase drug pricing transparency, expedite generic competition, review relationships between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program drug reimbursement methodologies. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the Trump administration proposals. The FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation (\"MFN\") executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the MFN model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the MFN\nmodel interim final rule. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug\u2019s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Further, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order that included multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden\u2019s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform. The plan sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform measures. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Also, there have been reports that the U.S. government is considering targeted price controls and reference pricing based on foreign single-payer country access policies, which, if implemented, could adversely affect our revenues.\nAny reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. Additionally, we are currently unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the healthcare industry may be enacted in the future or what effect recently enacted federal legislation or any such additional legislation or regulation would have on our business.\nIt is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe face potential product liability exposure far in excess of our limited insurance coverage.\nThe use of any of our potential products in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products, may expose us to liability claims. These claims might be made directly by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials in the amount of $10 million per occurrence and $25 million in the aggregate. However, our insurance may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, juries have awarded large judgments in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash reserves and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do. Our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nSeveral of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, distribution, manufacturing and marketing experience and resources than we do and represent substantial long-term competition for us. Other companies may succeed in developing and marketing products that are more effective and/or less costly than any products that may be developed and marketed by us, or that are commercially accepted before any of our products. Factors affecting competition in the pharmaceutical and drug industries vary, depending on the extent to which a competitor is able to achieve a competitive advantage based on its proprietary technology and ability to market and sell drugs. The industry in which we compete is characterized by extensive research and development efforts and rapid technological progress. Although we believe that our orphan drug status and proprietary position with respect to sparsentan may give us a competitive advantage, new developments are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that discoveries by others will not render such potential products noncompetitive. Furthermore, competitors could enter the market with generic versions of our products. For example, a generic option for the 100 mg version of the original formulation of Thola (tiopronin tablets) was approved by the FDA in May 2021.\nOur competitive position also depends on our ability to enter into strategic alliances with one or more large pharmaceutical and contract manufacturing companies, attract and retain qualified personnel, develop effective proprietary products, implement development and marketing plans, obtain patent protection, secure adequate capital resources and successfully sell and market our approved products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully achieve all of the foregoing objectives.\nUse of third parties to manufacture our products and product candidates may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product and product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, and clinical development and commercialization of our product and product candidates could be delayed, prevented or impaired.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our products or product candidates. We have limited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and we lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We outsource all manufacturing and packaging of our preclinical, clinical, and commercial products to third parties. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing\ntechniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production and in maintaining required quality control. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields and quality control, including stability of the product candidate.\nWe intend to rely on third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of our development stage product candidates, including sparsentan and pegtibatinase (TVT-058). We expect the manufacturers of each product candidate to at least initially and potentially for a significant period of time, be single source suppliers to us. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we may not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:\n\u2022reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022limitations on supply availability resulting from capacity and scheduling constraints of the third parties;\n\u2022impact on our reputation in the marketplace if manufacturers of our products fail to meet the demands of our customers;\n\u2022the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control; and\n\u2022the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThe failure of any of our contract manufacturers to maintain high manufacturing standards could result in injury or death of clinical trial participants or patients using our products. Such failure could also result in product liability claims, product recalls, product seizures or withdrawals, delays or failures in testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business or profitability.\nOur contract manufacturers will be required to adhere to FDA regulations setting forth cGMP. These regulations cover all aspects of the manufacturing, testing, quality control and recordkeeping relating to our product candidates and any products that we may commercialize. Our manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA, state regulators and similar regulators outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect regulatory approval and supplies of our product candidates.\nOur product and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that are both capable of manufacturing for us and willing to do so. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated vaccine development and manufacturing efforts have increased demand for the services supplied by many third party manufacturers, including some of those that we utilize for our products and product candidates, and there has recently been, and may continue to be, decreased availability of manufacturing slots at many such facilities. If the third parties that we engage to manufacture products for our developmental or commercial products should halt or cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience interruptions in cash flows and/or delays in advancing our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers, and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. Later relocation to another manufacturer will also require notification, review and other regulatory approvals from the FDA and other regulators and will subject our production to further cost and instability in the availability of our product candidates. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates, or the drug substances used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to sell our products and to develop our product candidates. This could greatly reduce our competitiveness. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been public concern over the availability and accessibility of critical medical products, and the Act enhances FDA\u2019s existing authority with respect to drug shortage measures. Under the Act, manufacturers must have in place a risk management plan that identifies and evaluates the risks to the supply of approved drugs for certain serious diseases or conditions for each establishment where the drug or active pharmaceutical ingredient is manufactured. The risk management plan will be subject to FDA review during an inspection. If we experience shortages in the supply of our marketed products, our results could be materially impacted.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any products that obtain regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nMaterials necessary to manufacture our products and product candidates may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may delay the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates.\nWe rely on the manufacturers of our products and product candidates to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce the compounds for our preclinical and clinical studies and rely on these other manufacturers for commercial distribution if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates. Suppliers may not sell these materials to our manufacturers at the time we need them or on commercially reasonable terms and all such prices are susceptible to fluctuations in price and availability due to transportation costs, government regulations, price\ncontrols, and changes in economic climate or other foreseen circumstances. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these materials by our manufacturers. In addition, inflation and/or global supply chain disruptions may have a negative impact on our manufacturers\u2019 ability to acquire the materials necessary for our business. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these materials. If our manufacturers are unable to obtain these materials for our preclinical and clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates would be delayed, significantly impacting our ability to develop our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would materially affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates. For example, in 2021 a membrane used in pegtibatinase (TVT-058) drug substance manufacturing became more difficult to acquire due to the same or similar membranes being used in certain of the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing and we continue to see challenges with securing materials used in the pegtibatinase manufacturing process that are in short supply as a result of the pandemic. While we believe our contingency plans will enable us to continue the ongoing clinical study of pegtibatinase (TVT-058) with the currently available clinical supplies, there is no guarantee that we will not face additional shortages of this membrane, or other materials necessary to manufacture pegtibatinase (TVT-058) or our other products and product candidates. If our risk mitigation plans are not successful in overcoming these challenges, our pegtibatinase program or other products and product candidates, could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact domestic and worldwide economic activity, including global supply and financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic also poses the risk that we or our clinical trial subjects, employees, contractors, collaborators, suppliers and vendors may be prevented from conducting certain clinical trials or other business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to travel restrictions, quarantines, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d and \"shelter-in-place\" orders or shutdowns that have been or may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities, or that our or their ability to conduct operations will be negatively impacted by staffing shortages while employees quarantine as a result of exposure to or transmission of the virus. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, including China, or the availability or cost of materials, which could potentially disrupt the supply chain for our commercial products, our product candidates or the comparator products in our ongoing clinical trials.\nThe timelines and conduct of our ongoing clinical trials may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in 2020 we experienced a reduction in the rates of patient enrollment in our ongoing clinical trials as a result of the pandemic. Clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be further delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic and patients\u2019 ability or willingness to participate in clinical trials. For those patients who are enrolled and desire to continue in the clinical trials, some patients may not be able or willing to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines or governmental orders impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, we may face increased challenges with the ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19, which could adversely impact our clinical trial operations, timelines and outcomes. In addition, we rely on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations (CROs) and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our clinical trials, and the pandemic may affect their ability to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs or to travel to sites to perform work for us. While we remain in close contact with our CROs, clinical sites and suppliers to attempt to assess the impacts that COVID-19 may have on our clinical trials and projected timelines and we continue to implement appropriate mitigating measures in accordance with recent FDA guidance in an effort to ensure the ongoing safety of the patients in our clinical trials and the continued collection of high quality data, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. As challenging as conducting clinical trials is during normal times, the risks, operational challenges and costs of conducting clinical trials has increased substantially during the pandemic. In addition, restrictions caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may result in impediments to obtaining biopsies, which could impact the ability to timely obtain diagnoses of IgAN or FSGS.\nBeginning in March 2020, substantially all of our workforce began working remotely either all or substantially all of the time as a result of applicable stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders. The effects of these orders and our related remote-work policies may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our development programs, regulatory and commercialization timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. In addition, as the applicable orders have recently begun to be lifted and certain of our employees begin to return to the office, we cannot guarantee that our workforce will not face an outbreak that could adversely impact our operations.\nWhile the long-term economic impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to predict, the widespread pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which could reduce our ability to access capital and could negatively affect our liquidity and the liquidity and stability of markets for our common stock and convertible notes. In addition, a further market correction, recession or depression resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock and convertible notes.\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, results of operations and financial position will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other\ncountries, business closures or business disruptions, global supply challenges, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects, and our profitability in the future is uncertain.\nWe face the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, many of which are beyond our control, associated with any business in its early stages and have a limited operating history on which an evaluation of our prospects can be made. Such prospects should be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a business in a new industry, characterized by a number of market entrants and intense competition, and in the shift from development to commercialization of new products based on innovative technologies.\nWe have experienced significant growth over the past five years in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations. We have expanded our sales and marketing, compliance and legal functions in addition to expansion of all functions to support a commercial organization. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. To succeed, we must recruit, retain, manage and motivate qualified clinical, scientific, technical, commercial and management personnel, and we face significant competition for experienced personnel.\nDue to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability on the part of our management to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products without strategic partners or licensees include:\n\u2022our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or educate adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products;\n\u2022the lack of complementary products to be offered by our sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage against companies with broader product lines;\n\u2022unforeseen costs associated with expanding our own sales and marketing team for new products or with entering into a partnering agreement with an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u2022efforts by our competitors to commercialize competitive products.\nMoreover, though we generate revenues from product sales arrangements, we may incur significant operating losses over the next several years. Our ability to achieve profitable operations in the future will depend in large part upon successful in-licensing of products approved by the FDA, selling and manufacturing these products, completing development of our products, obtaining regulatory approvals for these products, and bringing these products to market. The likelihood of the long-term success of our company must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new drug products, competitive factors in the marketplace, as well as the regulatory environment in which we operate.\nIn addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors.\nWe depend on a highly experienced and skilled workforce to grow and operate our business. If we are unable to attract, retain and engage our employees, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nThe execution of our strategic objectives and future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain a highly qualified workforce. We depend on contributions from our employees, and, in particular, our senior management team, to execute efficiently and effectively. Our success further depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled mid-level and senior managers as well as team members at various levels in the scientific, development, medical and commercial areas of the business.\nOur headquarters are based in San Diego, California. This region is home to many other biopharmaceutical companies and many academic and research institutions. Competition for qualified key talent in our market is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain employees on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, we may not be able to retain our existing employees or hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary, cash incentives and other employee benefits, we have provided stock options and restricted stock unit (\"RSU\") awards that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options and RSU awards that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific, development and commercial teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. All of our employees have at-will employment, which means that they\ncould leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance policies on the lives of any of our employees.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our hiring and retention needs, our ability to meet our strategic objectives and our business and operating results may be adversely impacted.\nWe will likely experience fluctuations in operating results and could incur substantial losses.\nWe expect that our operating results will vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year as a result of investments in research and development, specifically our clinical and preclinical development activities. We have not completed development of any drugs and we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n\u2022continue the open label portion of DUET and conduct the Phase 3 trials of sparsentan;\n\u2022continue the research and development of additional product candidates, including pegtibatinase (TVT-058);\n\u2022expand our sales and marketing infrastructure to commercialize our current products and any new products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and\n\u2022expand operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support product development efforts and our obligations as a public company.\nFurthermore, the extent of the ultimate impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on various developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, and its impact on potential customers, employees, and vendors, all of which cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.\nTo attain and sustain profitability, we must succeed in developing and commercializing drugs with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including the discovery of product candidates, successful completion of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of these activities. We may not be successful enough in these activities to generate revenues that are substantial enough to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become or remain profitable could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the market price of our common stock may also cause a loss of a part or all of your investment.\nNegative publicity regarding any of our products could impair our ability to market any such product and may require us to spend time and money to address these issues.\nIf any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to consumers and/or subject to FDA enforcement action, our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be impaired. Because of our dependence on patient and physician perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the use or misuse of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies could limit the commercial potential of our products and expose us to potential liabilities.\nWe may not have sufficient insurance to cover our liability in any current or future litigation claims either due to coverage limits or as a result of insurance carriers seeking to deny coverage of such claims.\nWe face a variety of litigation-related liability risks. Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, other applicable agreements, and/or Delaware law require us to indemnify (and advance expenses to) our current and past directors and officers and employees from reasonable expenses related to the defense of any action arising from their service to us, including circumstances under which indemnification is otherwise discretionary. While our directors and officers are included in a director and officer liability insurance policy, which covers all our directors and officers in some circumstances, our insurance coverage does not cover all of our indemnification obligations and may not be adequate to cover any indemnification or other claims against us. In addition, the underwriters of our present coverage may seek to avoid coverage in certain circumstances based upon the terms of the respective policies. If we incur liabilities that exceed our coverage under our directors and officers insurance policy or incur liabilities not covered by our insurance, we would have to self-fund any indemnification amounts owed to our directors and officers and employees in which case our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Further, if D&O insurance becomes prohibitively expensive to maintain in the future, we may be unable to renew such insurance on economic terms or unable renew such insurance at all. The lack of D&O insurance may make it difficult for us to retain and attract talented and skilled directors and officers to serve our company, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may need substantial funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our general and research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we conduct Phase 3 clinical trials of sparsentan, and conduct any other later-stage clinical trials of our product candidates. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales and marketing, securing commercial quantities of product from our manufacturers, and product distribution. We currently have no additional commitments or arrangements for any additional financing to fund the research and development and commercial launch of our product candidates. General market conditions resulting from the ongoing issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as market conditions affecting companies in the life sciences industry in general, may make it difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets on attractive terms, or at all.\nManagement believes our ability to continue our operations depends on our ability to sustain and grow revenue, results of operations and our ability to access capital markets when necessary to accomplish our strategic objectives. Management believes that we may incur losses in the immediate future. We expect that our operating results will vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year as a result of investments in research and development, specifically our clinical and preclinical development activities. We expect to finance our cash needs from cash on hand and results of operations, and depending on results of operations we may either need additional equity or debt financing, or need to enter into strategic alliances on products in development to continue our operations until we can achieve sustained profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities. Additional funds may not be available to us when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to reduce or eliminate research development programs or commercial efforts.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the progress and results of our pre-clinical and clinical studies of sparsentan for FSGS and IgAN, pegtibatinase (TVT-058) for HCU, Chenodal for CTX, and any other drug candidates;\n\u2022the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u2022debt service obligations on the 2025 Notes;\n\u2022the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue;\n\u2022the costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution;\n\u2022the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments;\n\u2022the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims;\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies; and\n\u2022our ability to establish collaborations and obtain milestone, royalty or other payments from any such collaborators.\nThe market price for shares of our common stock may be volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe price of our stock is likely to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u2022our entry into or the loss of a significant collaboration;\n\u2022regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, including changes in the health care payment systems;\n\u2022our ability to obtain and maintain marketing approvals from the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u2022variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022results of clinical trials conducted by others on drugs that would compete with our product candidates;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022public concern over our product candidates or any products approved in the future;\n\u2022litigation;\n\u2022communications from government officials regarding health care costs or pharmaceutical pricing;\n\u2022future sales or anticipated sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders; and\n\u2022the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, the stock markets, and in particular, the Nasdaq Global Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many pharmaceutical companies. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate new products or businesses we may acquire.\nWe intend to expand our product pipeline by pursuing acquisition of pharmaceutical products. If an acquisition is consummated, the integration of the acquired business, product or other assets into our company may also be complex and time- consuming and, if such businesses, products and assets are not successfully integrated, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, cost-savings or growth opportunities. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022integrating personnel, operations and systems, while maintaining focus on producing and delivering consistent, high quality products;\n\u2022coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;\n\u2022distracting employees from operations;\n\u2022retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; and\n\u2022managing inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the Company.\nFurthermore, these acquisitions and other arrangements, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or geographic markets, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business, product, technology or other asset or arrangement. Any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions or arrangements after we have expended resources on them.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. If any of our product candidates in clinical trials or commercialized products harm people we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims. We have clinical trial insurance and commercial product liability coverage. However, this insurance may not be adequate to cover all claims. We may be exposed to product liability claims and product recalls, including those which may arise from misuse or malfunction of, or design flaws in, such products, whether or not such problems directly relate to the products and services we have provided. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022damage to our reputation;\n\u2022regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients, including awards that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay from other sources, if available, and would damage our ability to obtain liability insurance at reasonable costs, or at all, in the future;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention from managing our business; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nA successful product liability claim or a series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our available cash and adversely affect our business.\nWe may become involved in certain litigation matters, any of which could result in substantial costs, divert management's attention and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nFrom time to time we may become involved in certain litigation matters, including those described in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Although we intend to vigorously defend our interests in each matter, there is no guarantee that we will be successful and we may have to pay damages awards or otherwise may enter into settlement arrangements in connection with such matters. Any such payments or settlement arrangements could have material adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending our interests in each matter, litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and may limit our commercial success.\nWe are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations, such as safety reporting requirements and additional post-marketing obligations, including regulatory oversight of the promotion and marketing of our products. In addition, the manufacture, quality control, labeling, packaging, safety surveillance, adverse event reporting, storage and recordkeeping for our products are subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. If we become aware of previously unknown problems with any of our products, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on our products, our contract manufacturers or us. If we, our products and product candidates, or the manufacturing facilities for our products and product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency, including the FDA, may send enforcement letters, mandate labeling changes, suspend or withdraw regulatory approval, suspend any ongoing clinical trials, refuse to approve pending applications or supplements filed by us, suspend or impose restrictions on manufacturing operations, request a recall of, seize or detain a product, seek criminal prosecution or an injunction, or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines. In such instances, we could experience a significant drop in the sales of the affected products, our product revenues and reputation in the marketplace may suffer, and we could become the target of lawsuits.\nWe are also subject to regulation by national, regional, state and local agencies, including but not limited to the FDA, CMS, Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the HHS Office of Inspector General and other regulatory bodies. The FDC Act, Social Security Act, Public Health Service Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern to varying degrees the research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities relating to prescription pharmaceutical products, including preclinical testing, clinical research, approval, production, labeling, sale, distribution, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information, promotion, marketing, and pricing to government purchasers and government health care programs. Our manufacturing partners are subject to many of the same requirements.\nCompanies may not promote drugs for \u201coff-label\u201d uses-that is, uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those approved by the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies. However, a company may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the product\u2019s labeling. A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our business operations and our reputation could be damaged.\nThe federal health care program Anti-Kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to\narrangements that pharmaceutical companies have with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others. Further, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors under the federal anti-kickback statute protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and an arrangement must meet all of the conditions specified in order to be fully protected from scrutiny under the federal anti-kickback statute. We seek to comply with the exceptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but our practices, such as our patient assistance programs and prompt pay discounts with certain customers, may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection from anti-kickback liability and may be subject to scrutiny.\nThe federal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the federal False Claims Act for a variety of alleged marketing activities, including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees, grants, free travel, and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company\u2019s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which may be used by states to set drug payment rates under government health care programs. Companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the marketing of their products for unapproved uses. Pharmaceutical and other health care companies have also been prosecuted on other legal theories of Medicare and Medicaid fraud.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. It is not clear whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of any Travere products, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nWe also could become subject to government investigations and related subpoenas. Such subpoenas are often associated with previously filed qui tam actions, or lawsuits filed under seal under the federal False Claims Act. Qui tam actions are brought by private plaintiffs suing on behalf of the federal government for alleged violations of the federal False Claims Act. The time and expense associated with responding to such subpoenas, and any related qui tam or other actions, may be extensive, and we cannot predict the results of our review of the responsive documents and underlying facts or the results of such actions. Responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties, settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.\nThe number and complexity of both federal and state laws continues to increase, and additional governmental resources are being added to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. In particular, the PPACA includes a number of provisions aimed at strengthening the government\u2019s ability to pursue anti-kickback and false claims cases against pharmaceutical manufacturers and other healthcare entities, including substantially increased funding for healthcare fraud enforcement activities, enhanced investigative powers, amendments to the federal False Claims Act that make it easier for the government and whistleblowers to pursue cases for alleged kickback and false claim violations and public reporting of certain payments and transfers of value by certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to physicians and teaching hospitals nationwide. We anticipate that government scrutiny of pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices will continue for the foreseeable future and subject us to the risk of further government investigations and enforcement actions. Responding to a government investigation or enforcement action would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn February 2021, we entered into a limited co-promotion arrangement with Albireo Pharma, Inc. (\"Albireo\"), providing for our Cholbam dedicated sales representatives to dedicate a portion of their efforts to promoting Albireo's product, Bylvay (odevixibat), in the United States following approval. In July 2021, Albireo announced that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has approved Bylvay (odevixibat) for the treatment of pruritis in patients with Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (\"PFIC\"). In addition to our activities in connection with promoting our own products, if our or Albireo's sales representatives violate or are perceived to have violated any applicable regulatory requirement in promoting Bylvay (odevixibat), we could become subject to investigations, litigation, and/or penalties as described above, reputational harm, as well as contractual liabilities associated with the Albireo co-promotion agreement, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state controlled, in a manner that is different than in the United States. We cannot assure that our internal control policies and\nprocedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in criminal or civil penalties or remedial measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"), created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal anti-kickback statute, the PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud provisions under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nAdditionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\nMoreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the current regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on our business, if any, may be.\nAlso, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Further, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and marketing codes, compliance with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines, and compliance with the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Other various state level requirements include restricting payments or the provision of other items of value that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; restricting various marketing practices; requiring prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products; requiring the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes; requiring the registration of sales representatives; requiring the reporting of certain information related to drug pricing; and requiring drug manufacturers to track and report information related to payments, gifts, compensation, and other items of value to physicians and other healthcare providers.\nIf we are not able to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our products, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates, once approved, and the activities associated with their manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sales are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to adhere to regulations set out by these bodies for one or more of our commercial products could prevent us from commercializing the product candidate in the jurisdiction of the regulatory authority. We have only limited experience in meeting the regulatory requirements incumbent on the sale of drugs in the United States and elsewhere, and expect to rely on third-parties to assist us in these processes. If these third parties fail to adequately adhere to the regulations governing drug distribution and promotion we may be unable to sell our products, which could have a material effect on our ability to generate revenue.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate in the jurisdiction of the regulatory authority. We have only limited experience in filing and prosecuting the applications necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process.\nSecuring FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing FDA approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and successful inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the FDA. Our future products may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nOur product candidates may fail to obtain regulatory approval for many reasons, including:\n\u2022our failure to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for a particular indication;\n\u2022the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022our inability to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks;\n\u2022our inability to demonstrate that the product candidate presents an advantage over existing therapies;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s or comparable regulatory authorities\u2019 disagreement with the manner in which we interpret the data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022failure of the third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical or commercial supplies to satisfactorily complete an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug\u2019s identity, strength, quality and purity; and\n\u2022a change in the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities or a change in the laws governing the approval process.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and non-United States regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. Any FDA or other regulatory approval of our product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn, including for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if clinical or manufacturing problems follow initial marketing.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse business consequences.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share (collectively, processing) personal data and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, data we collect about trial participants in connection with clinical trials, and sensitive third-party data. Our data processing activities subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contracts, and other obligations that govern the processing of personal data by us and on our behalf.\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, and consumer protection laws. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\"HITECH\"), and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH, through its implementing regulations, makes certain of HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as a person or organization, other than a member of a covered entity\u2019s workforce, that creates, receives, maintains or transmits protected health information for or on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA as well as their covered subcontractors. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) imposes obligations on businesses to which it applies. These obligations include, without limitation, providing specific disclosures in privacy notices, affording California residents certain rights related to their personal data, and requiring businesses subject to the CCPA to implement certain measures to effectuate California residents\u2019 personal data rights. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation). In addition, it is anticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (\u201cCPRA\u201d), effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. For example, the CPRA establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the CCPA (as amended), which could increase the risk of an enforcement action. Other states have enacted data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed its Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which differ from the CPRA and become effective in 2023. Additional data privacy and security legislation has been proposed at the federal, state, and local levels in recent years, which, along with existing laws, could increase our potential liability, increase compliance costs, or adversely affect our business.\nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards apply to data privacy and security. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cEU GDPR\u201d), the United Kingdom\u2019s GDPR (\u201cUK GDPR\u201d), Brazil\u2019s General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or \u201cLGPD\u201d) (Law No. 13,709/2018), and China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law (\u201cPIPL\u201d) impose strict requirements for processing personal data. For example, the EU GDPR imposes significant and complex burdens on processing personal data, particularly for processing \u201cspecial category personal data\u201d (such as personal data related to health and genetic information), which\ncould be relevant to our operations in the context of our conduct of clinical trials and is of interest to relevant regulators. Under the EU GDPR, government regulators may impose temporary or definitive bans on data processing, as well as fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater. Further, individuals may initiate litigation related to processing of their personal data.\nIn addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have proposed, and may propose, standards with which we are legally or contractually bound to comply.\nCertain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws, which could make it more difficult to transfer information across jurisdictions (such as transferring or receiving personal data that originates in the EU, the UK, Switzerland or in other foreign jurisdictions). Existing mechanisms that facilitate cross-border personal data transfers may change or be invalidated. For example, absent appropriate safeguards or other circumstances, the EU GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) that the European Commission does not consider to provide an adequate level of data privacy and security, such as the United States. The European Commission released a set of \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d (\u201cSCCs\u201d) that are designed to be a valid mechanism to facilitate personal data transfers out of the EEA to these jurisdictions. Currently, these Standard Contractual Clauses are a valid mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the EEA, but there exists some uncertainty regarding whether the SCCs will remain a valid mechanism. Additionally, the SCCs impose additional compliance burdens, such as conducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect the at-issue personal data. As we incorporate the new SCCs into our contractual arrangements, we may be required to expend significant resources to update our contractual arrangements and to comply with such obligations. In addition, Switzerland and the UK similarly restrict personal data transfers outside of those jurisdictions to countries such as the United States that do not provide an adequate level of personal data protection, and have also passed or are considering laws requiring local data residency or otherwise impeding the transfer of personal data across borders, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business.\nIf we are unable to implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border personal data transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and injunctions against processing or transferring personal data from Europe. Inability to import personal data from Europe to the United States may significantly and negatively impact our business operations, including by limiting our ability to conduct clinical trials activities in Europe and elsewhere; limiting our ability to collaborate with CROs, service providers, contractors and other companies that are subject to such cross-border data transfer or localization laws; or requiring us to increase our personal data processing capabilities and infrastructure in foreign jurisdictions at significant expense.\nOur obligations related to data privacy and security are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent fashion, creating some uncertainty as to the effective future legal framework. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires significant resources and may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Although we endeavor to comply with all applicable data privacy and security obligations, we may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations and compliance posture. For example, any failure by a third-party service provider to comply with applicable law, regulations, or contractual obligations could result in adverse effects, including proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. If we or any of our partners fail to comply or are perceived to have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we or they could be subject to a range of regulatory actions or litigation that could affect our or our partners' ability to commercialize our products and conduct necessary research and development, and could harm or prevent sales of the affected products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products. Any threatened or actual government enforcement action or litigation could also generate adverse publicity and require that we devote substantial resources that could otherwise be used in other aspects of our business. Compliance with applicable federal, state, and foreign laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that violate them may face substantial penalties. The potential sanctions include significant criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, administrative penalties, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, individual imprisonment, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, reputational harm, administrative burdens, interruption or cessation of clinical trials, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and other sanctions. Because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. Such a challenge, irrespective of the underlying merits of the challenge or the ultimate outcome of the matter, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf our information technology systems or data, or those of third parties upon which we rely, are or were compromised, we could experience adverse impacts resulting from such compromise, including, but not limited to, regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; interruptions to our operations such as clinical trials; harm to our reputation; loss of revenue or profits; and a loss of sales and other adverse consequences.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share (collectively, processing) proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, including personal data (such as health-related data), intellectual property, and trade secrets (collectively, sensitive information). We may rely upon third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, third-party providers of cloud-\nbased infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions. Our ability to monitor these third parties\u2019 information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. We may share or receive sensitive information with or from third parties.\nCyberattacks, malicious internet-based activity, and online and offline fraud are prevalent and continue to increase. These threats are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. These threats come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors. We and the third parties upon which we rely may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including, but not limited to, social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, and other similar threats. Ransomware attacks, including those from organized criminal threat actors, nation-states and nation-state supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions, delays, or outages in our operations, disruption of clinical trials, loss of data (including data related to clinical trials), loss of income, significant extra expenses to restore data or systems, reputational loss and the diversion of funds. To alleviate the financial, operational and reputational impact of a ransomware attack, it may be preferable to make extortion payments, but we may be unwilling or unable to do so (including, for example, if applicable laws prohibit such payments). Similarly, supply chain attacks have increased in frequency. The Company\u2019s data and information systems may also fail for reasons other than a security incident or breach, such as server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, and telecommunications failures. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and our remote workforce poses increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as more of our employees work from home, utilizing network connections outside our premises. Future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could also expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities\u2019 systems and technologies.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption. A security incident or other interruption could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to our sensitive information. A security incident or other interruption could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our products and services. We may expend significant resources or modify our business activities (including our clinical trial activities) to try to protect against security incidents. Certain data privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures, industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and sensitive information.\nWhile we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. We may be unable in the future to detect vulnerabilities in our information technology systems (including our products) because such threats and techniques change frequently, are often sophisticated in nature, and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Despite our efforts to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, if any, in our information technology systems, our efforts may not be successful and could result in a material disruption of our programs and operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for any of our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities\nApplicable data security laws, privacy policies and data security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of any security incidents, including affected individuals, customers, and regulators. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements, could lead to adverse consequences. If we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences. These consequences may include: government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive information (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may cause customers to stop using our products or services, deter new customers from using our products or services, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business.\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices or that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could affect the tax treatment of our domestic and foreign earnings. Any new taxes could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the Biden administration and Congress have proposed various U.S. federal tax law changes, which if enacted could have a material impact on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, the CARES Act, or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the\nrealization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nOur effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. Nevertheless, our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from state to state, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations and may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations.\nUnder current law, our federal net operating losses (\"NOLs\") generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") of $85.8 million. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to federal tax laws. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change U.S. tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. It is possible that we have experienced an ownership change in the past. In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control.\nAs a result, our federal NOL carryforwards may be subject to a percentage limitation if used to offset income in tax years following an ownership change. In addition, it is possible that we have in the past undergone, and in the future may undergo, additional ownership changes that could limit our ability to use all of our pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset our post-change income or taxes. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. As a result, we may be unable to use all or a material portion of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, which would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nChanges in funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if resource constraints continue to arise from the COVID-19 pandemic, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d may adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of our product candidates in the European Union, result in restrictions or imposition of taxes and duties for importing our product candidates into the European Union, and may require us to incur additional expenses in order to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates in the European Union.\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom was subject to a\ntransition period that ended December 31, 2020, or the Transition Period, during which EU rules continued to apply. A trade and cooperation agreement, or the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, that outlines the future trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union was agreed in December 2020.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom applicable to our business and our product candidates is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the European Union. For example, Great Britain is no longer covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorization from the EMA and, and a separate marketing authorization will be required to marker our product candidates in Great Britain. It is currently unclear whether the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (\"MHRA\") in the U.K. is sufficiently prepared to handle the increased volume of marketing authorization applications that it is likely to receive.\nWhile the Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for the tariff-free trade of medicinal products between the UK and the EU there may be additional non-tariff costs to such trade which did not exist prior to the end of the Transition Period. Further, should the UK diverge from the EU from a regulatory perspective in relation to medicinal products, tariffs could be put into place in the future. We could therefore, both now and in the future, face significant additional expenses (when compared to the position prior to the end of the Transition Period) to operate our business, which could significantly and materially harm or delay our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability of our business. Any further changes in international trade, tariff and import/export regulations as a result of Brexit or otherwise may impose unexpected duty costs or other non-tariff barriers on us. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the UK It is also possible that Brexit may negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees, particularly those from the EU. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United Kingdom.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of our third-party manufacturers, CROs and other contractors and consultants, could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in San Diego, California, an area prone to wildfires and earthquakes. These and other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. Any disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we rely on third-party manufacturers, some of whom are located in China, to manufacture API for certain of our product candidates, including sparsentan. Any disruption in production or inability of our manufacturers in China to produce or ship adequate quantities to meet our needs, whether as a result of a natural disaster or other causes (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), could impair our ability to operate our business on a day-to-day basis and to continue our research and development of our product candidates. In addition, we are exposed to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the United States or Chinese governments (such as tariffs on chemical intermediates we use that are manufactured in China), political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China. Any recall of the manufacturing lots or similar action regarding our API used in clinical trials could delay the trials or detract from the integrity of the trial data and its potential use in future regulatory filings. In addition, manufacturing interruptions or failure to comply with regulatory requirements by any of these manufacturers could significantly delay clinical development of potential products and reduce third-party or clinical researcher interest and support of proposed trials. These interruptions or failures could also impede commercialization of our product candidates and impair our competitive position.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness and Investments\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $276 million of total debt outstanding, classified as long term. As a result of our indebtedness, a portion of our cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on the 2025 Notes if the notes are not converted to shares of common stock prior to maturity. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or have future borrowings available to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.\nOur indebtedness pursuant to the 2025 Notes could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to any other debt we may incur in the future;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and related interest, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022increase our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt; and\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes.\nWe expect to use cash flow from operations and outside financings to meet our current and future financial obligations, including funding our operations, debt service and capital expenditures. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets, obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the 2025 Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future indebtedness may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the 2025 Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our future indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the 2025 Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nNoteholders may require us to repurchase their 2025 Notes following a fundamental change at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon conversion, we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock.\nWe may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the 2025 Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion of the 2025 Notes. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our future indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the 2025 Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion of the 2025 Notes. Our failure to repurchase the 2025 Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion of the 2025 Notes when required will constitute a default under the base and supplemental indentures that will govern the 2025 Notes, which we refer to collectively as the \u201cindenture.\u201d We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and the 2025 Notes.\nA default under the 2025 Notes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf an event of default under the 2025 Notes occurs, the principal amount of the 2025 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any) may be declared immediately due and payable, subject to certain conditions set forth in the indenture governing such notes. Events of default include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022failure to pay (for more than 30 days) interest when due;\n\u2022failure to pay principal when due;\n\u2022failure to deliver shares of common stock upon conversion of a 2025 Notes;\n\u2022failure to provide notice of a fundamental change;\n\u2022acceleration on our other indebtedness in excess of $10 million (other than indebtedness that is non-recourse to us); or\n\u2022certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency involving us.\nAccordingly, the occurrence of a default under the 2025 Notes, unless cured or waived, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nProvisions of the 2025 Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nCertain provisions of the 2025 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for or prevent a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the 2025 Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their 2025 Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such Notes in integral multiples of $1,000. We may also be required to increase the conversion rate for conversions in connection with certain fundamental changes.\nConversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their 2025 Notes.\nTo the extent we issue shares of common stock upon conversion of the 2025 Notes, the conversion of some or all of the 2025 Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of shares of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of shares of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2025 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2025 Notes could depress the price of shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14440, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RTRX"}
