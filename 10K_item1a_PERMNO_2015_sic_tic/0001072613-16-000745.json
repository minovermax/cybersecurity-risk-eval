RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our operations. The following highlights some of the factors that have affected, and in the future could affect, our operations.\nOur operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects as well as the effectiveness of our business strategy.\nWe acquired our first patent assets (which included our Remote Power Patent) in November 2003 and first generated revenue from our Remote Power Patent in May 2007. We next acquired our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and Cox Patent Portfolio in 2013. Our strategy is to acquire high quality patents that management believes have the potential to generate significant licensing opportunities as has been the case with our Remote Power Patent. Our Remote Power Patent has generated revenue in excess of $82,000,000 from May 2007 through December 31, 2015. To date we have generated $4,650,000 of revenue from our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and no revenue from our Cox Patent Portfolio. Accordingly, our success to date in executing our strategy in the patent licensing and enforcement business has been largely limited to one patent - our Remote Power Patent. Our future success depends upon our ability to protect our Remote Power Patent, successfully monetize our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and our Cox Patent Portfolio and acquire and successfully monetize additional patent assets. In light of our track record to date, the uncertainty of patent litigation, the significant time and resources needed to successfully monetize patent assets and the competition faced by us to acquire patent assets, there is a significant risk that we may not be able to grow our revenue and profit and continue to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to protect our patents.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon our proprietary technologies and our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We currently own twenty-seven (27) patents that relate to various technologies including (i) our Remote Power Patent covering the delivery of power to certain devices over PoE networks, (ii) our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio relating to foundational technologies that enable unified search and indexing, displaying and archiving of documents in a computer system, (iii) our Cox Patent Portfolio relating to identification of media content, and (iv) our QoS patents covering the transmission of audio, voice and data in order to achieve high quality of service (QoS) over computer and telephony networks. We have successfully defended several challenges to certain claims of our Remote Power Patent at the USPTO (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 28-29 hereof) However, the validity of our Remote Power Patent and other patents acquired by us as part of the acquisition of the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and the Cox Patent Portfolio are currently being challenged in patent infringement litigation pending in the courts or proceedings at the USPTO. (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 25-27 of this Annual Report). We rely upon our patents and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties to protect our intellectual property assets. The complexity of patent and common law and the uncertainty of the\noutcome of litigation create risk that our efforts to protect our intellectual property assets may not be successful. We cannot assure you that our patents will be upheld or that third parties will not invalidate our patent assets. If our intellectual property assets are not upheld, particularly our Remote Power Patent, such an event would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as our revenue stream is largely dependent upon the continued validity of our Remote Power Patent.\nIf we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings involving our intellectual property, including if any of the claims of defendants to invalidate our patents are successful, such a result would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently have several litigations pending in the courts against parties whom we believe require a license to our patents including (i) litigation against eight (8) data networking equipment manufacturers commenced in September 2011 relating to our Remote Power Patent, (ii) litigation against Apple, Inc. commenced in May 2013 with respect to one of our patents within our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and (iii) two litigations against Google and YouTube with respect to patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio. We also face proceedings at the USPTO challenging the validity of certain claims pertaining to patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio and Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio. In addition, in the future we may commence patent litigation against third parties alleging infringement of our patents. Patent litigation is inherently risky and the outcome is uncertain. The defendants in our pending litigations and proceedings at the USPTO are all large, well-financed companies with substantially greater resources than us. We may not be successful in such litigation and the outcome of such litigation could be harmful to us. In addition, it is customary for defendants in patent litigation to assert claims seeking to invalidate our patents including commencement of proceedings at the USPTO, as is the case with respect to our pending patent litigations. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing and validating our patents and/or if third party claims against us seeking to invalidate our patents are successful, they may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which effectively could block our ability to license or otherwise capitalize on our proprietary technologies. Furthermore, then existing licensees of our patents may no longer be obligated to pay royalties to us. Successful litigation against us resulting in a determination that our patents, particularly our Remote Power Patent, are not valid or enforceable, and/or that third parties do not infringe, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenue and profit is currently largely dependent upon the continued validity of our Remote Power Patent.\nAll of our revenue to date has been generated by our Remote Power Patent except for $4,650,000 of revenue relating to a settlement and license in November 2015 for our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio. We currently have fourteen (14) license agreements pursuant to which licensees have an obligation to pay us royalties on an ongoing basis. Such royalty bearing licenses include, among others, agreements with Cisco Systems, Inc., LLC, Microsemi Corporation, Netgear, Inc., Motorola Solutions, Inc., NEC Corporation and ShoreTel Inc.. The obligation of licensees of our Remote Power Patent to continue to make royalty payments to us is contingent upon the continued validity of our Remote Power Patent. The validity and infringement of our Remote Power Patent is currently at issue in our pending litigation against eight (8) data equipment manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at page 28 hereof). In the event our Remote Power Patent is determined to be invalid, licensees of our Remote Power Patent would have no further obligation to make royalty payments to us which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to capitalize on our strategy to acquire high quality patents with significant licensing opportunities or enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property.\nBased upon the success we have achieved to date from licensing our Remote Power Patent, the acquisition of an aggregate of thirteen (13) additional patents in 2013 and eight new patents issued to us by the USPTO thereafter, we believe we have the expertise and sufficient capital to compete in the intellectual property monetization market and to enter strategic relationships with third parties to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property. However, we may not be able to acquire additional intellectual property or, if acquired, we may not achieve material revenue or profit from such intellectual property. Acquisitions of patent assets are competitive, time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. Our strategy is to focus on acquiring high quality patent assets which management believes have the potential for significant licensing opportunities. These high quality patent opportunities are difficult to find and are often very competitive to acquire. In addition, such acquisitions present material risks. Even if we acquire additional patent assets, such as our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio acquired in 2013 (see Note H[2] to our financial statements included in this Annual Report), we may not be able to achieve significant licensing revenue or even generate sufficient revenue related to such patent assets to offset the acquisition costs and the legal fees and expenses which may be incurred to enforce, license or otherwise monetize such patents. In addition, we may not be able to enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property and, even if we consummate such strategic relationships, we may not achieve material revenue or profit from such relationships.\nWe are largely dependent upon our license agreement with Cisco for a significant portion of our revenue. The loss of Cisco as a licensee would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCisco Systems, Inc. accounted for 51% and 87% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. In accordance with our Settlement and License Agreement, dated May 25, 2011, with Cisco (the \"Agreement\"), Cisco is obligated to pay us royalties on a quarterly basis (which began in the first quarter of 2011 and continues through the full term of our Remote Power Patent which expires in March 2020) based on its sale of PoE products in the United States, up to the maximum royalties per year of $8 million through 2015 and $9 million per year thereafter for the remaining term of the patent (March 2020). The royalty payments are subject to certain conditions including the continued validity of our Remote Power Patent. The actual royalty payments may be less than the caps stated above. Under the terms of the Agreement, if we grant other licenses with lower royalty rates to third parties (as defined in the Agreement), Cisco shall be entitled to the benefit of the lower royalty rates provided it agrees to the material terms of such other license. Under the terms of the Agreement, we have certain obligations to Cisco and if we materially breach such terms, Cisco will be entitled to stop paying royalties to us. In addition, if our Remote Power Patent is declared invalid, Cisco would have no further obligation to pay us royalties. The aforementioned event would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in enforcing or defending our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio or Cox Patent Portfolio.\nWe acquired our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and Cox Patent Portfolio in 2013, which together currently consist of twenty-one (21) patents. In November 2015, we entered into our first material license agreement with respect to our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio with Microsoft Corporation which resulted in revenue of $4,650,000. We have not yet achieved any revenue from our Cox Patent Portfolio. We are currently enforcing patents within our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and Cox Patent Portfolio against defendants who are challenging these patents (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 25-28 hereof). We may not be successful in enforcing or defending our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio or our Cox Patent Portfolio, which would have a negative impact on our future revenue growth and profits.\nIn the future we could be classified as a Personal Holding Company resulting in a 20% tax on our PHC Income that we do not distribute to our shareholders.\nThe personal holding company (\"PHC\") rules under the Internal Revenue Code impose a 20% tax on a PHC's undistributed personal holding company income (\"PHC Income\" which means, in general, taxable income subject to certain adjustments). For a corporation to be classified as a PHC, it must satisfy two tests: that (i) more than 50% in value of its outstanding shares must be owned directly or indirectly by 5 or fewer individuals at anytime during the second half of the year (after applying constructive ownership rules to attribute stock owned by entities to their beneficial owners and among certain family members and other related parties) (the \"Ownership Test\") and (ii) at least 60% of its adjusted ordinary gross income for a taxable year consists of dividends, interest, royalties, annuities and rents (the \"Income Test\"). During the second half of 2015 through the date of this Annual Report (as well as prior years), we did not meet the Ownership Test. Due to the significant number of shares held by our largest shareholders, we will continually assess our share ownership to determine whether it meets the Ownership Test. If the Ownership Test were met and the income generated by us were determined to constitute \"royalties\" within the meaning of the Income Test, we would constitute a PHC and we would be subject to a 20% tax on the amount of any PHC Income (which cannot be offset by our NOLs) that we do not distribute to our shareholders.\nIt may be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our license agreement with Cisco and our other licensees, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue.\nThe standard terms of our royalty bearing license agreements require our licensees to report the sale of licensed products and report this data to us in most cases on a quarterly basis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. From time to time, we may audit certain of our licensees (as we did with Cisco in 2014 as referenced below) to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the revenue to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements. However, we cannot give assurances that these audits will be frequent enough and/or effective to that end. There is no certainty that we will receive additional revenue from an audit and in some cases there may be an over-payment which will be credited against future royalties under our license agreements.\nIn late December 2013, we exercised our right to audit the royalties paid to us by Cisco for the years 2012 and 2013 (the \"Audit Period\") in accordance with our May 2011 license agreement with Cisco. As a result of the audit, Cisco agreed to pay us additional royalty payments pursuant to the May 2011 license agreement of $3,281,000 for the Audit Period and other periods covered by the license agreement. These additional aggregate royalty payments of $3,281,000 were all recorded as revenue in the three month period ended June 30, 2014, at the time we completed our audit and additional royalty payments were agreed to by the parties.\nOur current licenses for our Remote Power Patent may not continue to result in significant revenue and do not necessarily mean we will achieve additional license agreements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we achieved revenue of $16,565,000 and $12,309,000 (which included $3,281,000 of additional royalty payments from Cisco as a result of our audit (See Note L to our financial statements included in this Annual Report), respectively. We currently have royalty bearing license agreements for our Remote Power Patent with fourteen (14) licensees including, among others, Cisco Systems, Inc., Netgear, Inc., Microsemi Corporation, Extreme Networks, Inc., Motorola Solutions, Inc., NEC Corporation and ShoreTel Inc., pursuant to which such parties are obligated to pay us on-going royalties on a monthly or quarterly basis. Notwithstanding such royalty bearing license agreements, we may not continue to achieve significant revenue from such license agreements. Our failure to continue to achieve significant revenue from our existing license agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to consummate additional licensing agreements resulting in material revenue with respect to our Remote Power Patent.\nOur current licensing revenue depends upon the continued viability of the PoE market.\nEthernet is the leading local area networking technology in use today. PoE technology allows for the delivery of power over Ethernet (\"PoE\") cables rather than by separate power cords. As a result a wide variety of network devices, including IP telephones, wireless LAN access points, web-based network security cameras, data collection terminals and other network devices are able to receive power over existing data cables. The failure of the PoE market to remain viable would have a material adverse effect on licensing revenue for our Remote Power Patent which is currently our sole patent generating on-going licensing revenue.\nA limited number of our licensees account for a significant portion of our total revenues.\nOne of our licensees, Cisco Systems, Inc. accounted for 51% and 87% (including the additional revenue from our Cisco audit in 2014 - see Note L to our financial statements included in this Annual Report) of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Microsoft Corporation accounted for 28% of our revenue in 2015. It is anticipated that a few licensees will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. To the extent sales of PoE products by our significant licensees are adversely affected our revenues will be significantly impacted.\nOur pending patent infringement litigations in the courts involving our Remote Power Patent, the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and the Cox Patent Portfolio may be time consuming and costly.\nWe have a pending litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division against eight (8) data networking equipment manufacturers for infringement of our Remote Power Patent. We also have a pending litigation (currently scheduled for trial in July 2016) against Apple, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, for infringement of our '227 Patent, which was one of the nine (9) patents acquired from Mirror Worlds LLC. In April 2014 and December 2014, we initiated patent litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Google and YouTube for infringement of several of our patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio. The litigation pertaining to our Cox Patent Portfolio is currently stayed pending resolution of proceedings at the USPTO (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at page 26 of this Annual Report).\nWe anticipate that the above referenced litigations in federal court (and proceedings at the USPTO) could continue for some time and while we have contingent legal fee arrangements with our patent litigation counsel in each litigation (excluding proceedings at the USPTO), we are responsible for a portion of the expenses which are anticipated to be material. In addition, the time and effort required of our management to effectively pursue these litigations is likely to be significant and it may adversely affect other business opportunities.\nWe face intense competition to acquire intellectual property and enter into strategic relationships.\nWith respect to our ability to acquire additional intellectual property or enter into strategic relationships with third parties to monetize their intellectual property, we face considerable competition from other companies, many of which have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have. The patent licensing and enforcement industry has grown significantly over the past several years and there has been an increase in the number of companies seeking to acquire intellectual property rights from third parties. Companies including, among others, Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTG), Vringo, Inc. (NYSE MKT:VRNG), Intellectual Ventures, WiLan Inc. (NASDAQ:WILN), VirnetX Holdings Corp. (NYSE MKT:VHC), Marathon Patent Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) and RPX Corporation (NASDAQ:RPXC) seek to acquire or partner with third parties to license or enforce intellectual property rights. It is expected that others will enter this market as well. Many of these competitors have significantly more financial and human resources than us.\nWe may also compete with strategic corporate buyers, litigation funding firms such as Burford Capital Limited, Fortress Investment Group, Gerchen Keller Capital, LLC, Parabellum Capital LLC and Bentham Capital LLC, venture capital firms and hedge funds for intellectual property acquisitions and licensing opportunities. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and human resources than us.\nNew legislation, regulations, court rulings or actions by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office related to enforcing patents could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the USPTO or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. United States patent laws were amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, referred to as the America Invents Act, which became effective on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, it attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation and new administrative post-grant review procedures to challenge the patentability of issued patents outside of litigation, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and Covered Business Method Review (CBM) proceedings which provide third parties a timely, cost effective alternative to district court litigation to challenge the validity of an issued patent. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. The America Invents Act and its implementation has increased the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of patent rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur quarterly and annual operating and financial results and our revenue are likely to fluctuate significantly in future periods.\nOur quarterly and annual operating and financial results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Our revenue and net income was $16,565,000 and $4,107,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $12,309,000 and $1,766,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our revenue and net income was $8,017,000 and $1,016,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to revenue of $8,698,000 and net income of $2,626,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012. Our revenue was $7,398,000 with net income of $8,493,000 (including net income of $6,903,000 related to the recording of a deferred tax benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to revenue of $33,037,000 and net income of $19,236,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010 (which 2010 revenue and net income were primarily due to achieving a large settlement of a patent litigation in July 2010). Accordingly, our revenue, net income and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors that are outside our control including, but not limited to, our ability and timing in consummating future license agreements for our intellectual property assets, the timing and extent of payments received by us from licensees, the timing and our ability to achieve successful outcomes from current and future patent litigation, and the timing and our ability to achieve revenue from future strategic relationships.\nThe patent monetization cycle is long, costly and unpredictable.\nThere is generally a significant time lag between acquiring a patent portfolio and recognizing revenue from those patent assets. During this time lag, significant costs are likely to be incurred which may have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flow and financial position. Furthermore, the outcome of our efforts to monetize our patents is uncertain and we may not be successful.\nWe may need additional financing to implement our strategy and expand our business.\nWe may need additional equity or debt financing beyond our existing cash to pursue our strategy including the acquisition of additional intellectual property assets or to enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or monetize their intellectual property. Any additional financing that we need may not be available and, if available, may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us. Our failure to obtain financing on a timely basis, or on economically favorable terms, could prevent us from pursuing our intellectual property acquisition strategy or from responding to changing business or economic conditions and could cause us to experience difficulty in withstanding adverse operating results.\nWe do not intend to pay future dividends on our common stock and thus stockholders must look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments.\nWe have not paid any dividends to our stockholders since 2010. In December 2010, the only time in our history, we paid a special cash dividend of $0.10 per share to holders of our common stock. We do not have any plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors, including future earnings, if any, operations, capital requirements, our general financial condition, the preferences of any series of preferred stock, our general business conditions and future contractual restrictions on payment of dividends, if any. Accordingly, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur.\nBecause ownership of our common stock is concentrated, investors may have limited influence on stockholder decisions.\nAs of March 1, 2016, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 32.8% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders may be able to exercise substantial control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership will limit other stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the NYSE MKT LLC if we fail to comply with continued listing standards.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NYSE MKT LLC under the symbol \"NTIP\". If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT LLC, our common stock could be delisted from NYSE MKT LLC. Such delisting could adversely affect the price and trading (including liquidity) of our common stock.\nOur markets are subject to rapid technological change and our technologies face potential technology obsolescence.\nThe markets covered by our intellectual property are characterized by rapid technological changes, changing customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our technologies obsolete or less marketable.\nIn addition, other companies may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to PoE and the other technologies covered by our intellectual property. Moreover, technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by other companies or adopted by various standards groups could render our Remote Power Patent obsolete, less marketable or unenforceable.\nDependence upon CEO and Chairman.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the personal efforts of Corey M. Horowitz, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. We are currently in discussions with Mr. Horowitz with respect to a new employment agreement for his continued services as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Horowitz would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on the life of Mr. Horowitz.\nThe burdens of being a public company may adversely affect us including our ability to pursue litigation.\nAs a public company, our management must devote substantial time, attention and financial resources to comply with U.S. securities laws. This may have a material adverse effect on management's ability to effectively and efficiently pursue its business. In addition, our disclosure obligations under U.S. securities laws require us to disclose information publicly that will be available to litigation opponents. We may, from time to time, be required to disclose information that may have a material adverse affect on our litigation strategies. This information may enable our litigation opponents to develop effective litigation strategies that are contrary to our interests.\nThe significant number of options and warrants outstanding may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nAs of March 1, 2016, there were outstanding options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,400,000 shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.83 to $2.34. To the extent that outstanding options and warrants are exercised, existing stockholder percentage ownership will be diluted and any sales in the public market of the common stock underlying such options may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds, finance intellectual property acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing capital stock that would dilute your ownership.\nWe may elect to raise financing by issuing equity securities, which, if conducted in the future, would materially reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Furthermore, any newly issued securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing common stock. Moreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of stock to decline. We may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or the issuance or sale of other securities or instruments senior to our common shares. The holders of any debt securities or instruments we may issue could have rights superior to the rights of our common stockholders.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock may cause the prevailing market price of our shares to decline and could harm our ability to raise additional capital.\nWe have previously issued a substantial number of shares of common stock, which are eligible for resale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, and may become freely tradable. We have also registered a substantial number of shares including shares that are issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants. In addition, if holders of options and warrants choose to exercise their purchase rights and sell shares of common stock in the public market or if holders of currently restricted common stock or registered common stock sell such shares in the public market, or attempt to publicly sell such shares in a short time period, the prevailing market price for our common stock may decline. Such decline in the price of our common stock may also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and in Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, could discourage a takeover and adversely affect existing stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors, without further action by stockholders, and may include, among other things, voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions, any of which could adversely affect holders of our common stock. Although there are currently no shares of preferred stock outstanding, future holders of preferred stock may have rights superior to our common stock and such rights could also be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to third parties.\nWe are also subject to the \"anti-takeover\" provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could prevent us from engaging in a \"business combination\" with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired that status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.\nThese provisions could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to delay, deter or prevent a change of control, or approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully enforce and/or defend our Remote Power Patent;\n\u25cf\nour ability to continue to receive material revenue from licensees of our Remote Power Patent;\n\u25cf\nour ability to continue to enter into favorable license agreements with third parties with respect to our Remote Power Patent;\n\u25cf\nour ability to license and monetize our patents besides the Remote Power Patent including the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and the Cox Patent Portfolio;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully defend our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and Cox Patent Portfolio;\n\u25cf\nour ability to acquire additional intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nour ability to achieve material revenue and profits;\n\u25cf\nour ability to enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nour ability to raise capital when needed;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf\ntechnology changes;\n\u25cf\nlegislative, regulatory and competitive developments; and\n\u25cf\neconomic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 34936, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "NTIP"}
