{"cik": "1593548", "company": "AP Gaming Holdco, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success in the competitive gaming industry depends in large part on our ability to develop and manage frequent introductions of innovative products. If we are unable to successfully and frequently introduce innovative products, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by dynamic customer demand and technological advances. As a result, we must continually introduce and successfully market new themes and technologies in order to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand.\nThere is no assurance that our investments in research and development will lead to successful new technologies or timely new products. We invest heavily in product development in various disciplines from hardware, software and firmware engineering to game design, video, multimedia, graphics and sound. Because our newer products are generally more technologically sophisticated than those we have produced in the past, we must continually refine our production capabilities to meet the needs of our product innovation. If we cannot efficiently adapt our manufacturing infrastructure to meet the needs of our product innovations, or if we are unable to make upgrades in our production capacity in a timely manner, our business could be negatively impacted.\nOur customers will generally accept a new product if it is likely to increase operator profits. The amount of operator profits primarily depends on consumer play levels, which are influenced by player demand for our products. There is no assurance that our new products will attain this market acceptance or that our competitors will not more effectively anticipate or respond to changing customer preferences. In addition, any delays by us in introducing new products on schedule could negatively impact our operating results by providing an opportunity for our competitors to introduce new products and gain market share ahead of us.\nOur business is vulnerable to changing economic conditions and to other factors that adversely affect the casino industry, which have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the play levels of our participation games, our product sales and our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers.\nDemand for our products and services depends largely upon favorable conditions in the casino industry, which is highly sensitive to casino patrons\u2019 disposable incomes and gaming activities. Discretionary spending on entertainment activities could further decline for reasons beyond our control, such as continued negative economic conditions, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, transportation disruptions or the results of adverse weather conditions. Any prolonged or significant decrease in consumer spending on entertainment activities could result in reduced play levels on our participation games, causing our cash flows and revenues from a large share of our recurring revenue products to decline. Unfavorable economic conditions have also resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, decreased liquidity in many financial markets, and significant volatility in the credit and equity markets.\nFurthermore, the extended economic downturn has impacted and could continue to impact the ability of our customers to purchase new gaming equipment or make timely payments to us. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, additional provisions for bad debt related to credit concerns on certain receivables.\nWe may not achieve the intended benefits of our recent acquisitions, or such acquisitions may disrupt our current plans and operations and we may no be able to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of such acquisitions within the intended time frame, if at all.\nWe have devoted and will continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Cadillac Jack and RocketPlay with AP Gaming. This integration may prove to be more difficult, costly and time-consuming than expected, which could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nany delay in the integration of strategies, operations, products and services;\n\u2022\ndiversion of the attention of management of the Company as a result of the acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndifferences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies that may delay successful integration;\n\u2022\nthe ability to retain key employees;\n\u2022\nthe challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of Cadillac Jack into those of the Company in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the acquisitions, including costs to integrate beyond current estimates; and\n\u2022\nthe disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, either the Company\u2019s ongoing operations or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies of the acquisition or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results and realizing their anticipated benefits after the acquisitions.\nOur inability to complete future acquisitions and integrate those businesses successfully could limit our future growth.\nFrom time to time, we pursue strategic acquisitions in support of our strategic goals. In connection with any such acquisitions, we could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our expanded or combined operations, including acquired assets, operations and personnel. There can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain necessary financing or regulatory approvals to complete potential acquisitions. Our ability to succeed in implementing our strategy will depend to some degree upon the ability of our management to identify, complete and successfully integrate commercially viable acquisitions. Acquisition transactions may disrupt our ongoing business and distract management from other responsibilities.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize any anticipated financial or operational benefits, synergies or cost savings from these acquisitions. We may also incur greater costs than estimated to achieve all of the synergies and other benefits from an acquisition. Integration may also be difficult, unpredictable and subject to delay because of possible company culture conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps. We may be required to integrate or, in some cases, replace, numerous systems, such as those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll, data privacy and security and regulatory compliance.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments.\nWe have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nreduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures, because we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less highly leveraged and that, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting; and\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets.\nDemand for our products and the level of play of our products could be adversely affected by changes in player and operator preferences.\nAs a supplier of gaming machines, we must offer themes and products that appeal to gaming operators and players. Our revenues are dependent on the earning power and life span of our games. We therefore face continuous pressure to design and deploy new and successful game themes and technologically innovative products to maintain our revenue and remain competitive. If we are unable to anticipate or react timely to any significant changes in player preferences, the demand for our gaming products and the level of play of our gaming products could decline. Further, our products could suffer a loss of floor space to table games or other more technologically advanced games, we could fail to meet certain minimum performance levels, or operators may reduce revenue sharing arrangements with us, each of which could negatively impact our sales and financial results. In addition, general changes in consumer behavior, such as reduced travel activity or redirection of entertainment dollars to other venues, could result in reduced demand and reduced play levels for our gaming products.\nThe gaming industry is intensely competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business could be negatively impacted.\nCompetition among manufacturers of electronic gaming equipment and systems is intense. Competition in our industry is primarily based on the amount of profit our products generate for our customers, together with cost savings, convenience and other benefits. We compete through the appeal of game content and features to the end player, the features and functionality of our hardware and software products, and the service and support we provide. Our competitors range from small, localized companies to large, multi-national corporations. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources and have been engaged in the design, manufacture and operation of electronic gaming equipment business for many years. Some of these companies own significant intellectual property, including patents in gaming technology and hardware design, systems and game play and trademarks. In addition, our larger competitors may have significantly larger content portfolios and content development capability and resources, are licensed in markets throughout the United States, and have international distribution.\nObtaining space and favorable placement on casino gaming floors is also a competitive factor in our industry. In addition, the level of competition among equipment providers has increased significantly due to, among other factors, cutbacks in capital spending by casino operators resulting from the economic downturn and decreased player spend. In select instances, we may pay for the right to place gaming machines on a casino\u2019s floor and increased fee requirements from such casino operators may greatly reduce our profitability.\nIn addition, we face competition from other segments of the gaming industry, including internet gambling, and state lotteries. There can be no assurance that new technologies or markets, such as legalized internet gambling, will not emerge that will increase these competitive pressures.\nOur ability to operate in our existing markets or expand into new jurisdictions could be adversely affected by changing regulations, new interpretations of existing laws, and difficulties or delays in obtaining or maintaining required licenses or approvals.\nWe operate only in jurisdictions where gaming is legal. The gaming industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation by U.S. federal, state and local governments, as well as Native American tribal governments, and foreign governments. While the regulatory requirements vary by jurisdiction, most require:\n\u2022\nlicenses and/or permits;\n\u2022\ndocumentation of qualifications, including evidence of financial stability;\n\u2022\nother required approvals for companies who design, assemble, supply or distribute gaming equipment and services; and\n\u2022\nindividual suitability of officers, directors, major stockholders, key employees and business partners.\nAny license, permit, approval or finding of suitability may be revoked, suspended or conditioned at any time. We may not be able to obtain or maintain all necessary registrations, licenses, permits or approvals, or could experience delays related to the licensing process which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to retain key employees.\nTo expand into new jurisdictions, in most cases, we will need to be licensed, obtain approvals of our products and/or seek licensure of our officers, directors, major equity holders, key employees or business partners and potentially lenders. If we fail to obtain a license required in a particular jurisdiction for our games and gaming machines, hardware or software or have such\nlicense revoked, we will not be able to expand into, or continue doing business in, such jurisdiction. Any delays in obtaining or difficulty in maintaining regulatory approvals needed for expansion within existing markets or into new jurisdictions can negatively affect our opportunities for growth. In addition, the failure of our officers, directors, key employees or business partners or lenders to obtain or receive licenses in one or more jurisdictions may require us to modify or terminate our relationship with such officers, directors, key employees or business partners or forego doing business in such jurisdiction.\nAlthough we plan to maintain our compliance with applicable laws as they evolve, there can be no assurance that we will do so and that law enforcement or gaming regulatory authorities will not seek to restrict our business in their jurisdictions or institute enforcement proceedings if we are not compliant. Moreover, in addition to the risk of enforcement action, we are also at risk of loss of business reputation in the event of any potential legal or regulatory investigation whether or not we are ultimately accused of or found to have committed any violation. A negative regulatory finding or ruling in one jurisdiction could have adverse consequences in other jurisdictions, including with gaming regulators. Furthermore, the failure to become licensed, or the loss or conditioning of a license, in one market may have the adverse effect of preventing licensing in other markets or the revocation of licenses we already maintain.\nFurther, changes in existing gaming regulations or new interpretations of existing gaming laws may hinder or prevent us from continuing to operate in those jurisdictions where we currently do business, which would harm our operating results. In particular, the enactment of unfavorable legislation or government efforts affecting or directed at manufacturers or gaming operators, such as referendums to increase gaming taxes or requirements to use local distributors, would likely have a negative impact on our operations. Gaming regulations in Mexico have not been formalized and although we believe that we are compliant with the current informal regulations, if there are changes or new interpretations of the regulations in that jurisdiction we may be prevented or hindered from operating our business in Mexico.\nMany jurisdictions also require extensive personal and financial disclosure and background checks from persons and entities beneficially owning a specified percentage (typically 5% or more) of our equity securities and may require the same from our lenders. The failure of these beneficial owners or lenders to submit to such background checks and provide required disclosure could jeopardize our ability to obtain or maintain licensure in such jurisdictions.\nOur revenues are vulnerable to the impact of changes to the Class II regulatory scheme.\nOur Native American tribal customers that operate Class II games under the IGRA are subject to regulation by the NIGC. The NIGC is currently conducting consultations with industry participants regarding Native American gaming activities, including the clarification of regulations regarding Class II gaming machines. It is possible that any such changes in regulations, when finally enacted, could cause us to modify our Class II games to comply with the new regulations, which may result in our products becoming less competitive. Any required conversion of games pursuant to changing regulatory schemes could cause a disruption to our business. In addition, we could lose market share to competitors who offer games that do not appear to comply with published regulatory restrictions on Class II games and therefore offer features not available in our products.\nOur ability to effectively compete in Native American gaming markets is vulnerable to legal and regulatory uncertainties, including the ability to enforce contractual rights on Native American land.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we derived a significant amount of our revenue from participation agreements with Native American gaming operators. Because federally recognized Native American tribes are independent governments with sovereign powers, subject to the IGRA, Native American tribes can enact their own laws and regulate gaming operations and contracts. Native American tribes maintain their own governmental systems and often their own judicial systems and have the right to tax persons and enterprises conducting business on Native American lands. Native American tribes also often have the right to require licenses and to impose other forms of regulation and regulatory fees on persons and businesses operating on their lands. In the absence of a specific grant of authority by Congress, U.S. states may regulate activities taking place on Native American lands only if the Native American tribe has a specific agreement or compact with the state. Our contracts with Native American tribal customers normally provide that only certain provisions, if any, will be subject to the governing law of the state in which a Native American tribe is located. However, these choice-of-law clauses may not always be enforceable.\nFurther, Native American tribes generally enjoy sovereign immunity from lawsuits similar to that of the individual U.S. states and the United States. Before we can sue or enforce contract rights with a Native American tribe, or an agency or instrumentality of a Native American tribe (for example, to collect revenue pursuant to our participation agreements or foreclose on financed gaming machines), the Native American tribe must effectively waive its sovereign immunity with respect to the matter in dispute, which we are not always able to obtain. Without a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, or if such\nwaiver is held to be ineffective, we could be precluded from judicially enforcing any rights or remedies against a Native American tribe, including the right to enter Native American lands to retrieve our property in the event of a breach of contract by the tribe that is party to the disputed contract. Even if the waiver of sovereign immunity by a Native American tribe is deemed effective, there could be an issue as to the forum in which a lawsuit can be brought against the Native American tribe. Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and generally do not have jurisdiction to hear civil cases relating to Native American tribes and we may be unable to enforce any arbitration decision effectively. In addition, courts have held that certain laws of general application, such as the United States patent, trademark and trade secret laws, are not binding on Native American tribes absent a binding waiver of sovereign immunity. While we have not had any experience with contract enforceability vis-\u00e0-vis our Native American customers, we are cognizant of recent cases involving other parties dealing with waivers of sovereign immunity. Those cases put into question how sovereign immunity may be viewed by courts in the future.\nOur agreements with Native American tribes are often subject to review by regulatory authorities. For example, our development agreements may be subject to review by the NIGC and any such review could require substantial modifications to our agreements or result in the determination that we have a proprietary interest in a Native American tribe\u2019s gaming activity, which could materially and adversely affect the terms on which we conduct our business. The NIGC may also reinterpret applicable laws and regulations, which could affect our agreements with Native American tribes.\nGovernment enforcement, regulatory action, judicial decisions and proposed legislative action have in the past affected, and will likely continue to affect, our business, operating results and prospects. Regulatory action against our customers or equipment on Native American tribal lands or in other markets could result in machine seizures and significant revenue disruptions, among other adverse consequences. Moreover, Native American tribal policies and procedures, as well as tribal selection of gaming vendors, are subject to the political and governance environment within the Native American tribe. Changes in tribal leadership or tribal political pressure can affect our business relationships within Native American markets.\nState compacts with our existing Native American tribal customers to allow Class III gaming could reduce demand for our Class II games and our entry into the Class III market may be difficult as we compete against larger companies in the tribal Class III market.\nCertain of our Class II Native American tribal customers have entered into compacts with the states in which they operate to permit the operation of Class III games. While we seek to also provide Class III alternatives in these markets, we believe the number of our Class II game machine placements in those customers\u2019 facilities could decline, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. As our Native American tribal customers continue to transition to gaming under compacts with the state, we continue to face significant uncertainty in the market that makes our business in these states difficult to manage and predict and we may be forced to compete with larger companies that specialize in Class III gaming. We believe the establishment of state compacts depends on a number of political, social, and economic factors that are inherently difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, although we attempt to closely monitor state legislative developments that could affect our business, we may not be able to timely predict if or when a compact could be entered into by one or more of our Native American tribal customers. For example, in Oklahoma, the continued introduction of Class III games since the passage of the tribal gaming compact in 2004 may put pressure our revenue and unit market share and our revenue share percentages and may result in a shift in the market from revenue share arrangements to a \u201cfor sale\u201d model.\nThe percentage of gaming revenue we receive pursuant to our participation agreements with our Native American tribal customers has, on average, decreased in recent years and may continue to decrease in the future.\nThe percentage of gaming revenue we receive pursuant to our participation agreements, or our participation rates, with our Native American tribal customers has, on average, decreased in recent years, negatively affecting our profit margins. There can be no assurance that participation rates will not decrease further in the future. In addition, our Native American tribal customers may adopt policies or insist upon additional business terms during the renewal of our existing participation agreements that negatively affect the profitability of those relationships. In addition, any participation agreements we may enter into in the future with new customers or in new jurisdictions may not have terms as favorable as our existing participation agreements.\nSlow growth in the development of new gaming jurisdictions or the number of new casinos, declines in the rate of replacement of existing gaming machines and ownership changes and consolidation in the casino industry could limit or reduce our future prospects.\nDemand for our new participation gaming machine placements and game sales is partially driven by the development of new gaming jurisdictions, the addition of new casinos or expansion of existing casinos within existing gaming jurisdictions and the replacement of existing gaming machines. The establishment or expansion of gaming in any jurisdiction typically requires a\npublic referendum or other legislative action. As a result, gaming continues to be the subject of public debate, and there are numerous active organizations that oppose gaming. There can be no assurances that new gaming jurisdictions will be established in the future or that existing jurisdictions will expand gaming and, to the extent states such as Illinois delay, reverse or alter planned expansions in gaming, our growth strategy could be negatively impacted.\nTo the extent new gaming jurisdictions are established or expanded, we cannot guarantee we will be successful penetrating such new jurisdictions or expanding our business in line with the growth of existing jurisdictions. As we enter into new markets, we may encounter legal and regulatory challenges that are difficult or impossible to foresee and which could result in an unforeseen adverse impact on planned revenues or costs associated with the new market opportunity. If we are unable to effectively develop and operate within these new markets, then our business, operating results and financial condition would be impaired. Furthermore, as we attempt to generate new streams of revenue by placing our participation gaming machines with new customers we may have difficulty implementing an effective placement strategy for jurisdictional specific games. Our failure to successfully implement an effective placement strategy could cause our future operating results to vary materially from what management has forecast.\nIn addition, the construction of new casinos or expansion of existing casinos fluctuates with demand, general economic conditions and the availability of financing. The rate of gaming growth in North America has decelerated and machine replacements are at historically low levels. Slow growth in the establishment of new gaming jurisdictions or delays in the opening of new or expanded casinos and continued declines in, or low levels of demand for, machine replacements could reduce the demand for our products and our future profits. Our business could be negatively affected if one or more of our customers is sold to or merges with another entity that utilizes more of the products and services of one of our competitors or that reduces spending on our products or causes downward pricing pressures. Such consolidations could lead to order cancellations, a slowing in the rate of gaming machine replacements, or require our current customers to switch to our competitors\u2019 products, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe may not realize satisfactory returns on money lent to new and existing customers to develop or expand gaming facilities or to acquire gaming routes.\nWe enter into agreements to provide financing for construction, expansion, or remodeling of gaming facilities, primarily in the state of Oklahoma, and also have agreements in other jurisdictions, such as Illinois, where we provide loans and advances to route operators to acquire location contracts and fund working capital. Under these agreements, we secure long-term contracts for game placements under either a revenue share or daily fee basis in exchange for the loans and advances. We may not, however, realize the anticipated benefits of any of these strategic relationships or financings as our success in these ventures is dependent upon the timely completion of the gaming facility, the placement of our gaming machines, and a favorable regulatory environment.\nThese activities may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, financial risks, or required expenditures that could adversely affect our liquidity. In connection with one or more of these transactions, and to obtain the necessary funds to enter these agreements, we may need to extend secured and unsecured credit to potential or existing customers that may not be repaid, incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay, or incur other contingent liabilities.\nThe failure to maintain controls and processes related to billing and collecting accounts receivable or the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers could negatively impact our business. As a result of these agreements, the collection of notes receivable has become a matter of greater significance. While we believe the increased level of these specific receivables has allowed us to grow our business, it has also required direct, additional focus of and involvement by management. Further, and especially due to the current downturn in the economy, some of our customers may not pay the notes receivable when due.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 20% of our gaming revenue was derived from one customer and approximately 40% of our revenue was generated from gaming operations in the state of Oklahoma.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 40% of our total revenue was derived from gaming operations in Oklahoma, and approximately 20% of our total gaming revenue was from one Native American gaming tribe in that state. The significant concentration of our revenue in Oklahoma means that local economic, regulatory and licensing changes in Oklahoma may adversely affect our business disproportionately to changes in national economic conditions, including adverse economic declines or slower economic recovery from prior declines. While we continue to seek to diversify the markets in which we operate, changes to our business, operations, game performance and customer relationships in Oklahoma, due to changing gaming regulations or licensing requirements, higher taxes, increased competition, declines in market revenue share percentages or otherwise, could have a material and adverse effect on or financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in our relationship with our largest customer, including a decrease in revenue share, removal of gaming\nmachines or non-renewal of contracts, could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, neighboring states such as Kansas, Texas and Arkansas have passed or could pass gaming legislation, which could take market share from Oklahoma gaming facilities or otherwise negatively impact the Oklahoma gaming market and, as a result, negatively impact our business.\nWe may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property.\nProtection of our proprietary processes, methods and other technology is important to our business. We generally rely on the patent, trademark and trade secret laws of the United States and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold, as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. The patent, trademark and trade secret laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. At least one federal court has held that United States patent, trademark and trade secret laws of general application are not binding on Native American tribes absent a binding waiver of sovereign immunity.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from products that use or incorporate certain intellectual property, and our operating results could be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful in protecting these rights from infringement. In addition, some of our games and features are based on trademarks, patents and other intellectual property licensed from third parties. Our future success may depend upon our ability to develop, obtain, retain and/or expand licenses for popular products and underlying intellectual property rights on reasonable terms in a competitive market, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or may not be available at all. In the event that we cannot renew and/or expand existing licenses, we may be required to discontinue or limit our use of the games or gaming machines that use the licensed technology or bear the licensed marks.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain trademark protection for the names or symbols under which we market our products and to obtain patent protection for our proprietary content and technologies. We may not be able to build and maintain goodwill in our trademarks or obtain trademark or patent protection, and there can be no assurance that any trademark, copyright or issued patent will provide competitive advantages for us, or that our intellectual property will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors. Additionally, any issued patents that cover our proprietary technology may not provide us with sufficient protection or be commercially beneficial to us. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability. The U.S. federal courts or equivalent national courts or patent offices elsewhere may invalidate our patents or find them unenforceable. Competitors may also be able to design around our patents. If we are unable to protect our patented technologies, we may not be able to commercialize our technologies, products or services and our competitors could commercialize our technologies.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect certain proprietary knowledge and we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees and independent contractors regarding our trade secrets and proprietary information. However, there can be no guarantees that every employee and consultant will execute these agreements or that our employees and consultants will not breach these agreements. If these agreements are breached, it is unlikely that the remedies available to us will be sufficient to compensate us for the damages suffered. Additionally, despite various confidentiality agreements and other trade secret protections, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how could become known to, or independently developed by, competitors. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods or know-how, it will be more difficult for us to enforce our rights and our business could be harmed.\nWe have a limited ability to prevent others from creating materially similar products. Despite our efforts to protect these proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may try to copy our gaming products, business models or systems, use certain of our confidential information to develop competing products, or develop independently or otherwise obtain and use our gaming products or technology, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or invalidity and adverse outcomes of litigation could adversely affect our operating results.\nCompetitors and others may infringe on our intellectual property rights, or may allege that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights. Monitoring infringement and misappropriation of intellectual property can be difficult and expensive, and we may not be able to detect infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights. We may also incur significant litigation expenses protecting our intellectual property or defending third-party intellectual property claims. These expenses could have an adverse effect on our future cash flows and results of operations. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance does not cover potential claims of this type. If we are found to infringe on the rights of others we could\nbe required to re-design or discontinue offering certain products or systems, to pay damages or to purchase a license to use the intellectual property in question from its owner, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Litigation can also distract management from the day-to-day operations of our business. There can be no assurances that certain of our products will not be determined to have infringed upon a third-party patent.\nIn addition, any of our current or future patents or patent applications, or those of our licensors, could face other challenges, such as interference proceedings, opposition proceedings and re-examination proceedings. Any such challenge, if successful, could result in the invalidation of, or in a narrowing of the scope of, any such current or future patents or patent applications. Any such challenges, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to defend and resolve, and would divert management time and attention.\nFailure to attract, retain and motivate key employees may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nOur success depends largely on recruiting and retaining talented employees. The market for qualified, licensable executives and highly skilled, technical workers, such as content developers, is intensely competitive. The loss of key employees or an inability to hire a sufficient number of technical workers could limit our ability to develop successful products, cause delays in getting new products to market, cause disruptions to our customer relationships or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nStates and other jurisdictions may amend or repeal gaming enabling legislation which could materially impact our business.\nStates and other jurisdictions may amend or repeal gaming enabling legislation which could materially impact our business. Changes to gaming enabling legislation could increase our operating expenses and compliance costs or decrease the profitability of our operations. Repeal of gaming enabling legislation could result in losses of capital investments and revenue and limit future growth opportunities. For example, recently, charity gaming facilities in Alabama were forced to close due to regulatory uncertainties in the market pertaining to the legality of electronic bingo games which negatively impact our revenue and ability to collect on receivables. If any jurisdiction in which we operate were to repeal gaming enabling legislation, there could be no assurance that we could sufficiently increase our revenue in other markets to maintain operations or service our existing indebtedness.\nOur business competes on the basis of the security and integrity of our systems and products.\nWe believe that our success depends, in part, on providing secure products and systems to our vendors and customers. Attempts to penetrate security measures may come from various combinations of customers, retailers, vendors, employees and others. Our ability to monitor and ensure the quality of our products is periodically reviewed and enhanced. Similarly, we assess the adequacy of our security systems to protect against any material loss to any of our customers and the integrity of the product to end-users. There can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by a security breach or lapse, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, business or prospects.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit customer financial information. Our information and processes are exposed to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact, operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.\nOur gaming machines may experience losses due to technical problems or fraudulent activities.\nOur success depends on our ability to avoid, detect, replicate and correct software and hardware anomalies and fraudulent manipulation of our gaming machines. We incorporate security features into the design of our gaming machines and other systems, which are designed to prevent us, our customers and patrons of our gaming machines from being defrauded. We also monitor our software and hardware to avoid, detect and correct any technical errors. However, there can be no guarantee that our security features or technical efforts will continue to be effective in the future. If our security systems fail to prevent fraud or if we experience any significant technical difficulties, our operating results could be adversely affected. Additionally, if third parties breach our security systems and defraud patrons of our gaming machines, or if our hardware or software experiences\nany technical anomalies, our customers and the public may lose confidence in our gaming machines and operations, or we could become subject to legal claims by our customers or to investigation by gaming authorities.\nOur gaming machines have experienced anomalies and fraudulent manipulation in the past. Games and gaming machines may be replaced by casinos and other gaming machine operators if they do not perform according to expectations, or may be shut down by regulators. The occurrence of anomalies in, or fraudulent manipulation of, our gaming machines may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other action by gaming regulatory authorities, including suspension or revocation of our gaming licenses or other disciplinary action.\nAlthough our network is private, it is susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, break-ins, cyberattacks and similar events. We have multiple site back-up for our services in the event of any such occurrence. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses and break-ins. Similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems in any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Adverse weather conditions, particularly flooding, tornadoes, heavy snowfall and other extreme weather conditions often deter our customer\u2019s end users from traveling, or make it difficult for them to frequent the sites where our games are installed. If any of those sites experienced prolonged adverse weather conditions, or if the sites in Oklahoma, where a significant number of our games are installed, simultaneously experienced adverse weather conditions, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe could face risks associated with, or arising out of, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that (i) regulate certain activities and operations that may have environmental or health and safety effects, such as the use of regulated materials in the manufacture of our products by third parties or our disposal of materials, substances or wastes, (ii) impose liability for costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources from, past spills, waste disposals on and off-site, or other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances, and (iii) regulate workplace safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations could increase our and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 costs and impact the availability of components required to manufacture our products. Violation of these laws may subject us to significant fines, penalties or disposal costs, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We could be responsible for the investigation and remediation of environmental conditions at currently or formerly operated or leased sites, as well as for associated liabilities, including liabilities for natural resource damages, third party property damage or personal injury resulting from lawsuits that could be brought by the government or private litigants, relating to our operations, the operations of facilities or the land on which our facilities are located. We may be subject to these liabilities regardless of whether we lease or own the facility, and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or by a prior owner or tenant, or by a third party or a neighboring facility whose operations may have affected such facility or land. That is because liability for contamination under certain environmental laws can be imposed on current or past owners or operators of a site without regard to fault. We cannot assure you that environmental conditions relating to our prior, existing or future sites or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our products contain defects, our reputation could be harmed and our results of operations adversely affected.\nSome of our products are complex and may contain undetected defects. The occurrence of defects or malfunctions in one or more of our products could result in financial losses for our customers and in turn termination of leases, cancellation of orders, product returns and diversion of our resources. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of revenue.\nOur business is subject to quarterly fluctuation.\nHistorically, our operating results have been highest during the first quarter and lowest in our third and fourth quarters, primarily due to the seasonality of player demand. Our quarterly operating results may vary based on the timing of the opening of new gaming jurisdictions, the opening or closing of casinos, the expansion or contraction of existing casinos, approval or denial of our products and corporate licenses under gaming regulations, the introduction of new products, the seasonality of customer capital budgets, the mix of domestic versus international sales and the mix of lease and royalty revenue versus sales and service revenue. As a result, our operating results could be volatile, particularly on a quarterly basis.\nSome of our products contain open source software which may be subject to restrictive open source licenses, requiring us to make our source code available to third parties and potentially granting third parties certain rights to the software.\nSome of our products contain open source software which may be subject to restrictive open source licenses. Some of these licenses may require that we make our source code governed by the open source software licenses available to third parties and/or license such software under the terms of a particular open source license, potentially granting third parties certain rights to our software. We may incur legal expenses in defending against claims that we did not abide by such licenses. If our defenses are unsuccessful, we may be enjoined from distributing products containing such open source software, be required to make the relevant source code available to third parties, be required to grant third parties certain rights to the software, be subject to potential damages or be required to remove the open source software from our products. Any of these outcomes could disrupt our distribution and sale of related products and adversely affect our business.\nRecently introduced or proposed smoking bans at customer facilities may adversely impact our revenues.\nSome U.S. jurisdictions have recently introduced or proposed smoking bans in public venues, including casinos, which may reduce player traffic in the facilities of our current and prospective customers, which may reduce revenues on our participation gaming machines or impair our future growth prospects and therefore may adversely impact our revenues in those jurisdictions. Other participants in the gaming industry have reported declines in gaming revenues following the introduction of a smoking ban in jurisdictions in which they operate and we cannot predict the magnitude or timing of any decrease in revenues resulting from the introduction of a smoking ban in any jurisdiction in which we operate.\nWe are controlled by AP Gaming VoteCo, LLC, which may have conflicts of interest with us in the future and may have interests that differ from the interests of holders of our common stock.\nCurrently, all of our outstanding shares of common stock are owned by Apollo Gaming Holdings, L.P. Since our initial issuance of shares of our common stock to Apollo Gaming Holdings, L.P., we restructured our common stock into two classes: class A voting common stock (\u201cClass A Shares\u201d) and class B non-voting common stock (\u201cClass B Shares\u201d). On April 28, 2014, upon receipt of all required governmental regulatory approvals, Apollo Gaming Holdings, L.P. exchanged its 10,000,000 Class A Shares for 10,000,000 Class B Shares, and the Company issued 100 Class A Shares to AP Gaming VoteCo, LLC. The 100 Class A Shares issued to AP Gaming VoteCo, LLC, represent 100% of our voting interests. AP Gaming VoteCo, LLC is an entity owned and controlled by Marc Rowan and David Sambur. Messrs. Rowan and Sambur have the power to control our affairs and policies, the election of our board of directors, the appointment of management, the entering into of mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets and other material transactions.\nSo long as Messrs. Rowan and Sambur continue to control our Class A Shares and control the election of our board of directors, which currently consists of Mr. Sambur, they have the authority, subject to the terms of the agreements that govern our outstanding debt, to issue additional shares of stock, implement share repurchase programs, declare dividends, pay advisory fees and make other decisions, and they may have an interest in our doing so. Their interests could conflict with the interests of holders of our Class B Shares in material respects. Furthermore, Mr. Rowan is affiliated with Apollo, which is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us, as well as businesses that represent major customers of our businesses. Accordingly, so long as Mr. Rowan continues to control our outstanding Class A Shares, Apollo\u2019s interests could also conflict with our interests or the interests of holders of our Class B Shares in material respects.\nWe are dependent on our suppliers and any failure of these parties to meet our performance and quality standards or requirements could cause us to incur additional costs or lose customers.\nThe manufacturing, assembling and designing of our electronic gaming machines depends upon a continuous supply of raw materials, such as source cabinets, which we currently source primarily from a limited number of suppliers. If our current suppliers are unable to deliver these items in the quantity required or in accordance with our standards of quality and we are unable to find an alternative supplier in a timely fashion or on reasonable terms, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers or our contractual obligations, which would adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nContinued operation and our ability to service several of our installed gaming machines depends upon our relationships with service providers, and changes in those relationships could negatively impact our business.\nWe operate several gaming machines that utilize third party software for which we do not own or control the underlying software code. Further, we enter into arrangements with third party vendors, from time to time, for the provision of services related to development and operation of our products. Consequently, our operations, growth prospects and future revenues\ncould be dependent on our continued relationships with third party vendors. While we have historically maintained good relationships with third party vendors, our business would suffer if we are unable to continue these relationships in the future. Our third party vendors may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests and goals, take actions contrary to our objectives or policies, undergo a change of control, experience financial and other difficulties or be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under our arrangements. The failure to avoid or mitigate the risks described above or other risks associated with such arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCasino operations are conducted at the discretion of our customers.\nOur casino customers are responsible for the operations of their facilities and are not required to consult us or take our advice on their operations, marketing, facility layout, gaming floor configuration, or promotional initiatives. Further, our customers\u2019 are solely responsible for safety and security at their facilities. Our customers have in the past, and will in the future, remodel and expand their facilities. Our operating and financial results could suffer if our machines are not a part of an optimized facility layout or gaming floor configuration, are not supported by effective marketing or promotional initiatives or are scheduled to be out of service during a facility remodeling, or our customers\u2019 facilities are closed or not visited because of end-users concern for safety, a lack of amenities, or other factors.\nThe risks related to operations in foreign countries and outside of traditional U.S jurisdictions could negatively affect our results.\nWe operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States, principally in Mexico and on tribal lands of Native American tribes. The developments noted below, among others, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\nsocial, political or economic instability;\n\u2022\nadditional costs of compliance with international laws or unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates outside the United States;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in the creditworthiness of parties with whom we have significant receivables or forward currency exchange contracts;\n\u2022\nexpropriation, nationalization and restrictions on repatriation of funds or assets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty protecting our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nrecessions in foreign economies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining foreign operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer tastes and trends;\n\u2022\nacts of war or terrorism; and\n\u2022\nU.S. government requirements for export.\nWe are continuing to improve our internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form 10. We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form 10, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.0 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this accommodation allowing for delayed adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe intend to continue to improve our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure we are able to produce accurate and timely financial statements. However, no assurance can be given that our actions will be successful.", "PERMNO": 17252, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "AGS"}
