{"cik": "1494448", "company": "EMERGENT CAPITAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness & Organizational Structure\nWe may not have sufficient funds to pay our debt and other obligations.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and operating cash flows may be inadequate to meet our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and our other obligations. At December 31, 2015, 593 of the policies we owned were pledged as collateral under our Revolving Credit Facilities. When those policies mature, distributions will be made pursuant to\n\u201cwaterfall\u201d payment structures and any amounts available to us will vary based on the respective then current loan to value ratio under each facility. Proceeds from the policies pledged as collateral under the Red Falcon Revolving Credit Facility are distributed with 5% of policy proceeds first directed to the lenders. Thereafter, both Revolving Credit Facilities contemplate that proceeds will be directed to pay fees to service providers and premiums with any remaining proceeds directed to pay outstanding interest and, in the case of the Red Falcon Revolving Credit Facility only, required amortization of 8% per annum on the greater of the then-outstanding balance of the loan or the initial advance. Under both Revolving Credit Facilities, to the extent there are not sufficient remaining proceeds in the waterfall to satisfy the amount of required interest and, in the case of the Red Falcon Revolving Credit Facility, amortization then due, Red Falcon and White Eagle will pay any such shortfall amount.\nUnder both Revolving Credit Facilities, after payment of interest and, in the case of the Red Falcon Revolving Credit Facility, required amortization, a percentage of the collections from policy proceeds are to be paid to the lenders, which will vary depending on the then loan-to-value ratio (\u201cLTV\u201d) as follows: (1) if the LTV is equal to or greater than 50%, all remaining proceeds will be directed to the lenders to repay the then outstanding principal balance; (2) if the LTV is less than 50% but greater than or equal to 25%, 65% of the remaining proceeds will be directed to the lenders to repay the then outstanding principal balance; or (3) if the LTV is less than 25%, 35% of the remaining proceeds will be directed to the lenders to repay the then outstanding principal balance, in each case, with remaining proceeds (\u201cExcess LTV Payments\u201d) directed to Red Falcon or White Eagle, as the case may be. Under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, the Excess LTV Payments will generally cease after White Eagle has received $76.1 million and, once the debt under the facility is repaid, 50% of the remaining proceeds will generally be directed to the lenders with the remainder paid to White Eagle. See Note 8, \u201cWhite Eagle Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and Note 9, \u201cRed Falcon Revolving Credit Facility\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance as to when proceeds or the amounts from maturities of the policies pledged as collateral under the Revolving Credit Facilities will be distributed to us. In addition, we are not able to borrow money under our Revolving Credit Facilities to pay interest or principal under the facilities or any other indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on any of our indebtedness, we will be in default, which could cause defaults under any other of our indebtedness then outstanding. Any such default would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, upon an event of default of either of the Revolving Credit Facilities, absent a waiver, in addition to principal and interest, the lenders\u2019 rights to proceeds from collections under the Revolving Credit Facilities will become due. If these obligations cannot be satisfied, the lenders, or their agent, may dispose of, release, or foreclose on (including by means of strict foreclosure on all or any of the policies or on our interests in White Eagle or Red Falcon, which might be exercised in a manner intended to impair our rights to excess proceeds of any liquidation of foreclosed assets), or take other actions with respect to the policies pledged as collateral under the Revolving Credit Facilities that we or our shareholders may disagree with or that may be contrary to the interests of our shareholders.\nOur substantial leverage and significant debt service obligations could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and make it more difficult for us to fund our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $298.2 million in outstanding long-term debt (without giving effect to the fair value of such indebtedness) consisting of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities and our 8.50% senior unsecured convertible notes (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d). Our substantial level of indebtedness could have important negative consequences to you and us, including:\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty satisfying our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty refinancing our existing indebtedness or obtaining financing in the future for working capital, premium payments, portfolio lending, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe will need to use a substantial portion of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u2022\nour debt level increases our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions;\n\u2022\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general; and\n\u2022\nour leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nWhile the terms of the financing arrangements governing our debt contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness\nincurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future; the more we become leveraged, the more we become exposed to the risks described above.\nWe may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital in a timely manner, at the level sought, or on favorable terms or at all.\nSubject to borrowing base limitations and other conditions to funding, White Eagle and Red Falcon may borrow proceeds to pay premiums on all of the life insurance policies pledged as collateral under their respective Revolving Credit Facilities at December 31, 2015. However, we estimate that, in addition to general overhead expenses, we will need to pay approximately $4.1 million in premiums to keep our remaining 39 life insurance policies that have not been pledged as collateral under the Revolving Credit Facilities in force through December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $20.3 million of cash and cash equivalents; of this amount, approximately $12.9 million is available to pay premiums on the 39 unencumbered policies and other overhead expenses, with approximately $7.4 million being restricted to the Revolving Credit Facilities. Accordingly, we must proactively manage our cash and may need to raise additional capital in order to effectively run our businesses, maintain the policies that have not been pledged under the Revolving Credit Facilities, pay interest expense on our debt and opportunistically grow our assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will, if needed, be able to raise additional or sufficient capital on favorable terms or at all.\nAs part of our cash management and business strategy, we may, subject to the covenants in our debt arrangements, determine to sell all or a portion of our portfolio, but there can be no assurance that we can consummate any sales or that, if consummated, sales of policies will be at or above their carrying values. We may also, subject to the covenants in our debt arrangements, determine to lapse certain of these policies that have a low return profile or as our portfolio management needs dictate. The lapsing of policies, if any, could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements and would create losses as the policies would be written down to zero.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner that we own our life settlements and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States, Ireland and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax proceeds from companies. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for intercompany arrangements and ownership of life settlements, which could increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal and state authorities and from 2014 on, foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a material negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. The U.S., Ireland and many countries in the European Union, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. Certain proposals, including proposals with retroactive effect, could include recommendations that would significantly increase our tax obligations where we do business or where our subsidiaries own life insurance policies. Any changes in the taxation of either international business activities or ownership of life settlements may increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations and, under certain circumstances, may constitute an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facilities.\nWe may not be able to refinance the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that may significantly limit our ability to refinance. In addition, the lender under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility has a substantial interest in and priority rights to distributions of certain proceeds of policies pledged by White Eagle. Such covenants and such interest in and rights to distributions may significantly reduce our ability to attract replacement financing were we to seek to refinance the credit facility as a means of limiting adverse actions by the lenders in the exercise of their remedies in relation to any event of default.\nWe may be unable to deduct interest payments on debt that is attributed to policies that we own, which would reduce any future income and cash flows.\nGenerally, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), interest paid or accrued on debt obligations is deductible in computing a taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax liability. However, when the proceeds of indebtedness are used to pay premiums on life insurance policies that are owned by the entity incurring the debt or otherwise used to support the purchase or ownership of life insurance policies, the interest in respect of such proceeds may not be deductible. Accordingly, so long as we use a portion of debt financing to pay the premiums on policies owned by us or to support the continued ownership of life insurance policies by us, the interest paid or accrued on that portion of the debt may not be currently deductible by us for federal income tax purposes. Although we have net operating losses that we may be able to use to reduce a portion of our future taxable income, the inability to currently deduct interest accrued on debt could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings and cash flows available for the payment of interest.\nWe may not have the cash necessary to repurchase the Convertible Notes.\nWe have issued $70.7 million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A fundamental change under the Convertible Notes is deemed to occur whenever any of the following occurs: (a) our common stock ceases to be listed or quoted on a national securities exchange in the United States, (b) our shareholders approve any plans for liquidation or dissolution, or (c) we experience a change in control represented by: (1) a majority of the members of our board of directors no longer being considered continuing directors, (ii) a transaction whereby our shareholders own less than 50% of the surviving company after the transaction, or (iii) a person or group obtaining more than 50% of the voting power of the common stock.\nHowever, we may not have enough available cash to make a required repurchase of the Convertible Notes at the applicable time and, in such circumstances, may not be able to obtain the necessary financing on favorable terms. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes may be limited by law or by the agreements governing our other indebtedness that exist at the time of the repurchase, as the case may be. Our failure to repurchase of the Convertible Notes when required by their indenture would constitute a default, which could also lead to a default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and to repurchase the Convertible Notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur success in operating our life finance business is dependent on making accurate assumptions about life expectancies and maintaining adequate cash balances to pay premiums.\nWe are responsible for paying all premiums necessary to keep the policies in our portfolio in force and prevent them from lapsing. We estimate that we will need to pay $4.1 million in premiums to keep our current portfolio of life insurance policies that are not pledged as collateral under the Revolving Credit Facilities in force through 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $20.3 million of cash and cash equivalents; of this amount, approximately $12.9 million is available to pay premiums on the 39 unencumbered policies and general expenses, with approximately $7.4 million being restricted to the Revolving Credit Facilities. By using cash reserves to pay premiums for retained life insurance policies, we will have less cash available for other business purposes, including purchasing additional life insurance policies. Therefore, our cash flows and the required amount of our cash reserves to pay premiums is dependent on our assumptions about life expectancies being accurate.\nLife expectancies are estimates of the expected longevity or mortality of an insured and are inherently uncertain. A life expectancy obtained on an insured for a life insurance policy may not be predictive of the future longevity or mortality of the insured. Inaccurate forecasting of an insured\u2019s life expectancy could result from, among other things: (i) advances in medical treatment (e.g., new cancer treatments) resulting in deaths occurring later than forecasted; (ii) inaccurate diagnosis or prognosis; (iii) changes to life style habits or the individual\u2019s ability to fight disease, resulting in improved health; (iv) reliance on outdated or incomplete age or health information about the insured, or on information that is inaccurate (whether or not due to fraud or misrepresentation by the insured); or (v) improper or flawed methodology or assumptions in terms of modeling or crediting of medical conditions.\nIn forecasting estimated life expectancies, we utilize third party medical underwriters to evaluate the medical condition and life expectancy of each insured. The firms that provide health assessments and life expectancy information may depend on, among other things, actuarial tables and model inputs for insureds and third-party information from independent physicians who, in turn, may not have personally performed a physical examination of any of the insureds and may have relied solely on reports provided to them by attending physicians or other health care providers with whom they were authorized to\ncommunicate. The accuracy of this information has not been and will not be independently verified by us or our service providers.\nIf life expectancy valuations underestimate the longevity of the insureds, the actual maturity date of the life insurance policies may be farther in the future than projected. Consequently, we may not have sufficient cash for payment of insurance premiums or to service our indebtedness. The extension of time to receive a return on our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhen we receive life expectancy reports, we apply them to a modified version of the 2008 Valuation Basic Table (\u201c2008 VBT\u201d), a mortality table developed by the U.S. Society of Actuaries (the \u201cSOA\u201d) to calculate a mortality factor that assists in generating the best estimate probabilistic cash flow stream by calculating a mortality curve that projects the probability of mortality for each period based on the calculated mortality factors and the death rates from the 2008 VBT. We modify the table by incorporating future mortality improvements to better reflect the curves used by life expectancy providers. During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the SOA released tables for a new Valuation Basic Table (the \u201c2015 VBT\u201d). We have not adopted the 2015 VBT although we may do so in the future and are continuing to monitor the market reaction to the 2015 VBT as well as our portfolio\u2019s mortality experience to determine whether future adoption of the 2015 VBT would be an appropriate change to our valuation technique. However, the 2015 VBT would suggest a reduced probabilistic cash flow stream for us over the next several years. Any actual reduction in cash flows would reduce our ability to service our indebtedness. Future changes in life expectancies or actuarial tables could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of our life settlements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent and future increases to the premiums due on life insurance policies that we own will adversely affect the fair value and our returns on such life insurance policies.\nTo keep the life insurance policies that we own in force, insurance premiums must be timely paid. Projected premium payments are a critical component of our fair value estimates, and any increase in expected premiums will likely decrease the fair value of a given life insurance policy and adversely affect the return on that policy. Beginning in 2015 and continuing into 2016, certain insurance companies announced that they were increasing the cost of insurance on certain types of their issued policies, which will result in increases to the premium payments necessary to keep the affected policies in force. At December 31, 2015, 21 policies that we own were subject to the cost of insurance increases. These increases caused the fair value of these 21 policies to decrease during the quarter ending December 31, 2015 by approximately $5.0 million and will require us to incur additional costs to maintain these policies. Further cost of insurance increases may cause our required premium outlay to increase significantly, adversely affect the loan to value ratios under the Revolving Credit Facilities and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and the value of any affected policies.\nInvestigations by the SEC and IRS could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn February 17, 2012, we first received a subpoena issued by the staff of the SEC seeking documents dating back to 2007, generally related to our premium finance business and corresponding financial reporting. The SEC is investigating whether any violations of federal securities laws have occurred, and we have been cooperating with the SEC regarding this matter. We are unable to predict what action, if any, the SEC or its staff might take in the future as a result of the matters that are the subject to its investigation. We have not established any provision for losses in respect of this matter. No assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of the SEC Investigation will not result in administrative, civil or other proceedings or sanctions against us or our employees by the SEC or any other state or federal regulatory agencies. Such proceedings may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, actions against us or our employees, modifications to business practices and compliance programs or the imposition of sanctions against us. Protracted investigations could also impose substantial costs and distractions, regardless of their outcomes. There can be no assurance that any final resolution of this and any similar matters will not have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, certain contractual obligations require that we indemnify and advance the legal costs incurred by certain individuals, if any, in connection with the SEC Investigation. The obligation to advance expenses on behalf of these individuals and indemnify them, while currently unquantifiable, could be substantial, strain our liquidity position and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOn February 19, 2014, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries received summonses from the IRS Criminal Investigation Division requiring us to produce information about us in connection with our legacy structured settlements business. We are cooperating with the IRS Investigation, but are unable to predict what action, if any, the IRS might take in the future as a result of the matters that are the subject of the summonses or what impact, if any, the cost of providing further\ninformation and documents might have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if the IRS Investigation results in a determination by the IRS that we have failed to comply with any of our obligations under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations thereunder, we could incur additional tax liability, restitution payment obligations, penalties, fines, interest payments or other liabilities, including criminal penalties and fines and a reduction in our net operating losses, that could have a material adverse effect on us, our personnel, our financial condition, our results of operations and/or our cash flows.\nThe premiums necessary to maintain our life finance assets are expected to increase as we continue to acquire additional policies.\nAs our portfolio grows, so do the premiums necessary to keep our policies in force. Assuming no maturities in 2016, we would need to pay $4.2 million in premiums in 2016 to maintain the policies owned as of December 31, 2015 that are not pledged under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility and the Red Falcon Revolving Credit Facility. For the 437 policies pledged as collateral under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, White Eagle is eligible to borrow under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility to pay the estimated $51.9 million in premiums for 2016 (assuming no maturities) and Red Falcon is eligible to borrow the estimated $15.4 million in premiums for 2016 for the 156 policies pledged as collateral under the Red Falcon Revolving Credit Facility (assuming no maturities), in each case, so long as the applicable borrower maintains compliance with the borrowing base formula determined by the lender. If either White Eagle or Red Falcon is unable to draw under the Revolving Credit Facilities, it may not be able to sustain the policies they own, which could lead to lapses or an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facilities.See Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nContractions in the market for life insurance policies could make it more difficult for us to opportunistically sell policies that we own and may make it more difficult to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facilities.\nA potential sale of a life insurance policy owned by us depends significantly on the market for life insurance, which may contract or disappear depending on the impact of potential government regulation, future economic conditions and/or other market variables. For example, the secondary and tertiary markets for life insurance policies incurred a significant slowdown in 2008, which lasted several years. Historically, many investors who invest in life insurance policies are foreign investors who are attracted by potential investment returns from life insurance policies issued by United States life insurers with high ratings and financial strength, as well as by the view that such investments are non-correlated assets-meaning changes in the equity or debt markets should not affect returns on such investments. Changes in the value of the United States dollar and corresponding exchange rates, as well as changes to the ratings of United States life insurers can cause foreign investors to suffer a reduction in the value of their United States dollar denominated investments and reduce their demand for such products, which could make it more difficult for us to opportunistically sell our life insurance policies.\nThe ability of White Eagle and Red Falcon to continue to draw borrowings under their respective Revolving Credit Facilities is, in each case, controlled by a borrowing base formula. To the extent the above noted and other factors result in market contractions, they will likely also negatively impact the value of the policies owned by White Eagle and Red Falcon, which could decrease the respective borrowing base under the facilities. If either White Eagle or Red Falcon is unable to draw under the Revolving Credit Facilities, it may not be able to sustain the policies they own, which could lead to lapses or an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facilities.\nOur fair value assumptions are inherently subjective and, if the fair value of our life insurance policies decreases, we will report losses with respect to these policies we own.\nWhen we obtain ownership of a life insurance policy, we record the policy as an investment in life settlements at the transaction price as of the date of acquisition. At the end of each reporting period, we re-value the life insurance policies we own. To the extent that the calculation results in an adjustment to the fair value of the policy, we record this as a change in fair value of our life insurance policies. This evaluation of the fair value of life insurance policies is inherently subjective as it requires estimates and assumptions that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Using our valuation model, we determine the fair value of life insurance policies on a discounted cash flow basis. The most significant assumptions that we estimate are the life expectancy of the insured, expected premium payments and the discount rate. The discount rate is based upon current information about market interest rates, the credit exposure to the insurance company that issued the life insurance policy and our estimate of the risk margin an investor in the policy would require. Third party life expectancy providers review and analyze the medical records of an insured and provide us with a life expectancy estimate based on the insured\u2019s health. We then calculate a mortality impairment factor for the insured as that factor which, when applied to our mortality table, reproduces the same life expectancy provided for that insured. We use the resulting mortality impairment factor to generate a series of probabilistic future cash flows for the policy, which we then discount and aggregate to arrive at the fair value of the policy. If we are unable to accurately estimate any of these factors, we may have to write down the\nfair value of our life settlements, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition. Adopting the 2015 VBT may also result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our policies. See -\u201cOur success in operating our life finance business is dependent on making accurate assumptions about life expectancies and maintaining adequate cash balances to pay premiums.\u201d\nInsurable interest concerns regarding a life insurance policy can also adversely impact its fair value. A claim or the perceived potential for a claim for rescission or a challenge to insurable interest by an insurance company or by persons with an insurable interest in the insured of a portion of or all of the policy death benefit can negatively impact the fair value of a life insurance policy. If the SEC Investigation or, IRS Investigation cause us to experience more challenges to the life insurance policies that we own than we otherwise would experience, those challenges could negatively impact the fair value of such life insurance policies. See \u201cLitigation\u201d under Note 14, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nIf the calculation of fair value results in a decrease in value, we record this reduction as a loss. If we determine that it is appropriate to increase the discount rate or adjust other inputs to our fair value model, if we are otherwise unable to accurately estimate the assumptions in our valuation model, or if other factors cause the fair value of our life insurance policies to decrease, the carrying value of our assets may be materially adversely affected and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe life insurance policies that we own may be subject to contest, rescission and/or non-cooperation by the issuing life insurance company, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAll states require that the initial purchaser of a new life insurance policy insuring the life of an individual have an \u201cinsurable interest,\u201d meaning a stake in the insured\u2019s health and wellbeing, rather than the insured\u2019s death, in such individual\u2019s life at the time of original issuance of the policy. Whether an insurable interest exists in the context of the purchase of a life insurance policy is critical because, in the absence of a valid insurable interest, life insurance policies are unenforceable under most states\u2019 laws. Where a life insurance policy has been issued to a policyholder without an insurable interest in the life of the individual who is insured, the life insurance company may be able to void or rescind the policy. Even if the insurance company cannot void or rescind the policy, the insurable interest laws of a number of states provide that persons with an insurable interest on the life of the insured may have the right to recover a portion or all of the death benefit payable under a policy from a person who has no insurable interest on the life of the insured. These claims can generally only be brought if the policy was originally issued to a person without an insurable interest in the life of the insured.\nMany states have enacted statutes prohibiting stranger-originated life insurance, or STOLI, in which an individual purchases a life insurance policy with the intention of selling it to a third-party investor, who lacks an insurable interest in the insured\u2019s life. Some insurance carriers have contested policies as STOLI arrangements, specifically citing the existence of certain nonrecourse premium financing arrangements as a basis to challenge the validity of the policies used to collateralize the financing. Additionally, if an insurance carrier alleges that there were misrepresentations or fraud in the application process for an insurance policy, they may sue us or others to contest or rescind that policy. If a policy that we own is subject to a successful contest or rescission, the fair value of the policy could be reduced to zero, negatively impacting the discount rates used to value our portfolio generally and our ability to sell policies. Generally, life insurance policies may only be rescinded by the issuing life insurance company within the contestability period, which, in most states is two years. Lack of insurable interest can in some instances form the basis of loss of right to payment under a life insurance policy for many years beyond the contestability period and insurance carriers have been known to challenge claims for death benefits for more than five years from issuance of the policy.\nFrom time to time, insurance carriers have challenged the validity of policies owned by us or that once served as the underlying collateral for a premium finance loan made by us. See \u201cLitigation\u201d under Note 14, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the USAO Investigation and the SEC Investigation and have caused us to experience more challenges to policies by insurers attempting to use such investigations and the Non-Prosecution Agreement as grounds for rescinding or contesting a policy. Any such future challenges may result in a cloud over title and collectability, increased costs, delays in payment of life insurance proceeds or even the voiding of a policy, and could have a material adverse effect on the ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if an insurance company successfully rescinds or contests a policy, the insurance company may not be required to refund all or, in some cases, any of the insurance premiums paid for the policy. While defending an action to contest or rescind a policy, premium payments may have to continue to be made to the life insurance company. Hence, in the case of a\ncontest or rescission, premiums paid to the carrier (including those paid during the pendency of a contest or rescission action) may not be refunded. If they are not, we may suffer a complete loss with respect to a policy, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPremium financed life insurance policies are susceptible to a higher risk of fraud and misrepresentation on life insurance applications, which increases the risk of contest, rescission or non-cooperation by issuing life insurance carriers.\nWhile fraud and misrepresentation by applicants and potential insureds in completing life insurance applications exist generally in the life insurance industry (especially with respect to the health and medical history and condition of the potential insured as well as the applicant\u2019s net worth), such risk of fraud and misrepresentation may be heightened in connection with life insurance policies for which the premiums are financed through premium finance loans. In particular, there is a risk that applicants and potential insureds may not have truthfully or completely answered questions related to whether the life insurance policy premiums would be financed through a premium finance loan or otherwise, the applicants\u2019 purpose for purchasing the policy or the applicants\u2019 intention regarding the future sale or transfer of life insurance policies. Such risk may be further increased to the extent life insurance agents communicated to applicants and potential insureds regarding potential premium finance arrangements or transfers of life insurance policies through payment defaults under premium finance loans. In the ordinary course of our legacy premium finance business, our sales team received inquiries from life insurance agents and brokers regarding the availability of premium finance loans for their clients. However, any communication between the life insurance agent and the potential policyholder or insured is beyond our control and we may not know whether a life insurance agent discussed with the potential policyholder or the insured the possibility of a premium finance loan by us or the subsequent transfer of the life insurance policy. Consequently, notwithstanding the representations and certifications obtained from the policyholders, insureds and the life insurance agents, there is a risk that insurance carriers, the estates or heirs of insureds, or others could contest policies we acquired through foreclosures of premium finance loans based on fraud or misrepresentation as to any information provided to the life insurance company, including the life insurance application. See \u201cLitigation\u201d under Note 14, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nMisrepresentations, fraud, omissions or lack of insurable interest can also, in some instances, form the basis of loss of right to payment under a life insurance policy. Based on statements made in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, there is a risk that policies that we own may increasingly be challenged by insurance carriers and the estates or heirs of insureds. Any such challenges to the policies may result in increased costs, delays in payment of life insurance proceeds or even the voiding of a policy, a reduction in the fair value of a policy and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, of the 632 policies in our life settlement portfolio, 544 policies were previously premium financed.\nDelays in payment and non-payment of life insurance policy proceeds can occur for many reasons and any such delays may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA number of arguments may be made by former beneficiaries (including but not limited to spouses, ex-spouses and descendants of the insured) under a life insurance policy, by the beneficiaries of the trust that once held the policy, by the estate or legal heirs of the insured or by the insurance company issuing such policy, to deny or delay payment of proceeds following the death of an insured, including arguments related to lack of mental capacity of the insured, usury, contestability or suicide provisions in a policy. The statements in the Non-Prosecution Agreement may make such delays more likely and may increase challenges by carriers to paying out death claims or challenges by families of insureds to policy proceeds. Furthermore, if the death of an insured cannot be verified and no death certificate can be produced, the related insurance company may not pay the proceeds of the life insurance policy until the passage of a statutory period (usually five to seven years) for the presumption of death without proof. Such delays in payment or non-payment of policy proceeds may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete with a number of other finance companies and investors and may encounter additional competition.\nThere are a number of finance companies and investors that compete with us in the life finance industry. Many are significantly larger and possess considerably greater financial, marketing, management and other resources than we do. The life finance business could also prove attractive to new entrants. As a consequence, competition in this sector may increase. Increased competition could result in increased acquisition costs, changes to discount rates, margin compression and/or less favorable financing terms, each of which could materially adversely affect our income, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a regulator or court decides that trusts that were formed to own the life insurance policies that once served as collateral for our premium finance loans do not have an insurable interest in the life of the insured, such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGenerally, there are two forms of insurable interests in the life of an individual, familial and financial. Additionally, an individual is deemed to have an insurable interest in his or her own life. It is also a common practice for an individual, as a grantor or settlor, to form an irrevocable trust to purchase and own a life insurance policy insuring the life of the grantor or settlor, where the beneficiaries of the trust are persons who themselves, by virtue of certain familial relationships with the grantor or settlor, also have an insurable interest in the life of the insured. In the event of a payment default on our premium finance loan, we generally acquired life insurance policies owned by trusts (or the beneficial interests in the trust itself) that we believe had an insurable interest in the life of the related insureds. However, a state insurance regulatory authority or a court may determine that the trust or policy owner did not have an insurable interest in the life of the insured or that we, as lender, only have a limited insurable interest. Any such determination could result in our being unable to receive the proceeds of the life insurance policy, which could lead to a total loss on our investment in life settlements. Any such loss or losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the creditworthiness of the life insurance companies that issued the policies in comprising our portfolio. If a life insurance company defaults on its obligation to pay death benefits on a policy we own, we would experience a loss of our investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the creditworthiness of the life insurance companies that issued the policies that we own. We assume the credit risk associated with life insurance policies issued by various life insurance companies. The failure or bankruptcy of any such life insurance or annuity company could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation. A life insurance company\u2019s business tends to track general economic and market conditions that are beyond its control, including extended economic recessions or interest rate changes. Changes in investor perceptions regarding the strength of insurers generally and the policies or annuities they offer can adversely affect our ability to sell or finance our assets. Adverse economic factors and volatility in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on a life insurance company\u2019s business and credit rating, financial condition and operating results, and an issuing life insurance company may default on its obligation to pay death benefits on the life insurance policies that we own. In such event, we would experience a loss of our investment in such life insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires us to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. We have consumed and will continue to consume management resources and incur expenses for SOX compliance on an ongoing basis. In addition, as we have reduced the number of our employees and moved certain of our operations to foreign subsidiaries, we have increased our reliance on third parties for various aspects of our internal controls. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nChanges to statutory, licensing and regulatory regimes governing life settlements could have a material adverse effect on our activities and income.\nChanges to statutory, licensing and regulatory regimes could result in the enforcement of stricter compliance measures or adoption of additional measures on us or on the insurance companies that stand behind the insurance policies that we own, which could have a material adverse impact on our business activities and income. The SEC issued a task force report in July 2010 recommending that sales of life insurance policies in life settlement transactions be regulated as securities for purposes of the federal securities laws. To date, the SEC has not made such a recommendation to Congress. However, if the statutory definitions of \u201csecurity\u201d were amended to encompass life settlements, we could become subject to additional extensive regulatory requirements under the federal securities laws, including the obligation to register sales and offerings of life settlements with the SEC as public offerings under the Securities Act of 1933 and, potentially, the obligation to register as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940. Any legislation implementing such regulatory change or a change in the transactions that are characterized as life settlement transactions could lead to significantly increased\ncompliance costs, increased liability risk and adversely affect our ability to acquire or sell life insurance policies in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur former structured settlements business may expose us to future claims or contingent liabilities.\nPursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement we entered into in connection with the sale of our structured settlements business, we sold substantially all of that business\u2019 operating assets while retaining substantially all of its liabilities. In addition, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain breaches of representations and warranties regarding us and various aspects of that business. Many of our indemnification obligations are subject to time and maximum liability limitations, however, in some instances our indemnification obligations are not subject to any limitations. Significant indemnification claims by the purchaser or other claims or contingent liability related to our former structured settlement business could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable and other information, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information, or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such information, could adversely affect us.\nIn connection with our business, we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to insureds and counterparties. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, counterparty, employee or our data by cybercrime or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, litigation or regulatory action.\nDisasters, disruptions and other impairment of our information technologies and systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur businesses depend upon the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including third party hosted services and data facilities that we do not control. While we have developed certain disaster recovery plans and backup systems, these plans and systems are not fully redundant. A system disruption caused by a natural disaster, cybercrime or other impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and may cause delays, loss of critical data and reputational harm, and could otherwise prevent us from servicing our portfolio of life insurance policies.\nThe loss of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our key executive officers, including Antony Mitchell, our chief executive officer. Mr. Mitchell has significant experience operating specialty finance businesses, which are highly regulated. If we should lose Mr. Mitchell, such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our executives other than Mr. Mitchell.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our executive officers\u2019 employment agreements could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors or otherwise effect a change of control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nWe have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers. These agreements provide for substantial payments upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including a material diminution of base salaries or responsibilities. These payments may deter any transaction that would result in a change in control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors or otherwise effect a change of control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In particular, shareholders are required to provide us with advance notice of shareholder nominations and proposals to be brought before any annual meeting of shareholders, which could discourage or deter a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or to introduce a proposal. In addition, our articles of incorporation eliminate our shareholders\u2019 ability to act without a\nmeeting and require the holders of not less than 50% of the voting power of our common stock to call a special meeting of shareholders.\nThese provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. For example, these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future. Furthermore, our articles of incorporation and our bylaws provide that the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time by our board of directors, provided that the board shall consist of at least three and no more than fifteen members.\nThe market price of our stock has been highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and could fluctuate substantially in the future. This volatility may subject our stock price to material fluctuations due to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, and other factors including market reaction to the estimated fair value of our portfolio; rumors or dissemination of false information; changes in coverage or earnings estimates by analysts; our ability to meet analysts\u2019 or market expectations; and sales of common stock by existing shareholders.\nThe conversion rate for the Convertible Notes will be adjusted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change.\nIf a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to maturity, under certain circumstances, we will increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock for the Convertible Notes converted in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. The increase in the conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the make-whole fundamental change occurs or becomes effective and the price paid (or deemed paid) per share of common stock in such fundamental change. A make-whole fundamental change general means a fundamental change or redemption by us of the Convertible Notes. Such increase in the conversion rate will dilute the ownership interest of our common stock shareholders.\nCertain laws of the State of Florida could impede a change of control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nAs a Florida corporation, we are subject to the Florida Business Corporation Act, which provides that a person who acquires shares in an \u201cissuing public corporation,\u201d as defined in the statute, in excess of certain specified thresholds generally will not have any voting rights with respect to such shares, unless such voting rights are approved by the holders of a majority of the votes of each class of securities entitled to vote separately, excluding shares held or controlled by the acquiring person. The Florida Business Corporation Act also contains a statute which provides that an affiliated transaction with an interested shareholder generally must be approved by (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our voting shares, other than the shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder, or (ii) a majority of the disinterested directors.\nOne of our subsidiaries, Imperial Life Settlements, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is licensed as a viatical settlement provider and is regulated by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. As a Florida viatical settlement provider, Imperial Life Settlements, LLC is subject to regulation as a specialty insurer under certain provisions of the Florida Insurance Code. Under applicable Florida law, no person can finally acquire, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of a viatical settlement provider or its controlling company without the written approval of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Accordingly, any person who acquires beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our voting securities will be required by law to notify the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation no later than five days after any form of tender offer or exchange offer is proposed, or no later than five days after the acquisition of securities or ownership interest if no tender offer or exchange offer is involved. Such person will also be required to file with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation an application for approval of the acquisition no later than 30 days after the same date that triggers the 5-day notice requirement.\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation may disapprove the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting securities by any person who refuses to apply for and obtain regulatory approval of such acquisition. In addition, if the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation determines that any person has acquired 10% or more of our voting securities without obtaining its regulatory approval, it may order that person to cease the acquisition and divest itself of any shares of our voting securities that may have been acquired in violation of the applicable Florida law. Due to the requirement to file an application with and obtain approval from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, purchasers of 10% or more of our voting securities may incur additional expenses in connection with preparing, filing and obtaining approval of the application, and the effectiveness of the acquisition will be delayed pending receipt of approval from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation may also take disciplinary action against Imperial Life Settlements, LLC\u2019s license if it finds that an acquisition of our voting securities is made in violation of the applicable Florida law and would render the further transaction of business hazardous to our counterparties, creditors, shareholders or the public.", "PERMNO": 12557, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "EMGC"}
