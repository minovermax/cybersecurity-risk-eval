Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below. Any of these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects, and could cause the trading price of our securities to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face, but represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are dependent on a single line of business.\nPrior to our September 2016 acquisition of PTF, we were engaged only in the design, manufacture and marketing of standard and custom-engineered electronic components that are used primarily to control the frequency or timing of signals in electronic circuits. Although our acquisition of PTF added an additional product line that includes highly engineered products for the generation of time and frequency references for synchronization and control, until we see significant growth from the PTF product line or develop or acquire additional product lines we will remain dependent on our electronic components line of business. Virtually all of our 2017 and 2016 revenues came from sales of electronic components, which consist of packaged quartz crystals, oscillator modules, electronic filters and integrated modules. We expect that this product line will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in 2018.\nGiven our reliance on this single line of business, any decline in demand for this product line or failure to achieve continued market acceptance of existing and new versions of this product line may harm our business and our financial condition. Additionally, unfavorable market conditions affecting this line of business would likely have a disproportionate impact on us in comparison with certain competitors, who have more diversified operations and multiple lines of business. Should this line of business fail to generate sufficient sales to support ongoing operations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop alternate business lines.\nOur operating results vary significantly from period to period.\nWe experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations include: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and inventory; our effectiveness in engineering and qualifying new product designs with our OEM customers and in managing the risks associated with offering those new products into production; changes in the cost and availability of raw materials, which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; macroeconomic and served industry conditions; and events that may affect our production capabilities, such as labor conditions and political instability. In addition, due to the prevailing economic climate and competitive differences between the various market segments which we serve, the mix of sales between our communications, networking, aerospace, defense, industrial and instrumentation market segments may affect our operating results from period to period.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had net income of approximately $117,000 and $148,000, respectively. Our revenues are derived primarily from MtronPTI, whose future rate of growth and profitability are highly dependent on the development and growth of demand for our products in the communications, networking, aerospace, defense, instrumentation and industrial markets, which are cyclical. We cannot be certain whether we will generate sufficient revenues or sufficiently manage expenses to sustain profitability.\nWe have a large customer that accounts for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of this customer, or decrease in its demand for our products, could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nIn 2017, our largest customer, an electronics contract manufacturing company, accounted for $3,744,000, or 16.7%, of the Company's total revenues, compared to $3,275,000, or 15.7%, in 2016. The loss of this customer, or a decrease in its demand for our products, could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nA relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our accounts receivable, and the insolvency of any of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2017, four of our largest customers accounted for approximately $1,100,000, or 32.0%, of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2016, four of our largest customers accounted for approximately $1,242,000, or 35.1%, of accounts receivable at the end of 2016. The insolvency of any of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.\nOur order backlog may not be indicative of future revenues.\nOur order backlog is comprised of orders that are subject to specific production release, orders under written contracts, oral and written orders from customers with which we have had long-standing relationships and written purchase orders from sales representatives. Our customers may order products from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long and may cancel or defer orders without significant penalty. They also may cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive. As a result, we cannot provide assurances as to the portion of backlog orders to be filled in a given year, and our order backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual revenues for any subsequent period.\nWe are a holding company, and therefore are dependent upon the operations of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company that transacts business through our operating subsidiaries. Our primary assets are cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, the shares of our operating subsidiaries and intercompany loans. Should our cash and cash equivalents be depleted, our ability to meet our operating requirements and to make other payments will depend on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds.\nOur future rate of growth and profitability are highly dependent on the development and growth of the communications, networking, aerospace, defense, instrumentation and industrial markets, which are cyclical.\nIn 2017 and 2016, the majority of our revenues were derived from sales to manufacturers of equipment for the communications, networking, defense, aerospace, instrumentation and industrial markets for frequency and spectrum control devices, including indirect sales through distributors and contract manufacturers. During 2018, we expect a significant portion of our revenues to continue to be derived from sales to these manufacturers. Often OEMs and other service providers within these markets have experienced periods of capacity shortage and periods of excess capacity, as well as periods of either high or low demand for their products. In periods of excess capacity or low demand, purchases of capital equipment may be curtailed, including equipment that incorporates our products. A reduction in demand for the manufacture and purchase of equipment for these markets, whether due to cyclical, macroeconomic or other factors, or due to our reduced ability to compete based on cost or technical factors, could substantially reduce our net sales and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. Moreover, if these markets fail to grow as expected, we may be unable to maintain or grow our revenues. The multiple variables which affect the communications, networking, aerospace, defense, instrumentation and industrial markets for our products, as well as the number of parties involved in the supply chain and manufacturing process, can impact inventory levels and lead to supply chain inefficiencies. As a result of these complexities, we have limited visibility to forecast revenue projections accurately for the near and medium-term timeframes.\nThe market share of our customers in the communications, networking, aerospace, defense, instrumentation and industrial markets may change over time, reducing the potential value of our relationships with our existing customer base.\nWe have developed long-term relationships with our existing customers, including pricing contracts, custom designs and approved vendor status. If these customers lose market share to other equipment manufacturers in the communications, networking, aerospace, defense, instrumentation and industrial markets with whom we do not have similar relationships, our ability to maintain revenue, margin or operating performance may be adversely affected.\nWe may make acquisitions that are not successful, or we may fail to integrate acquired businesses into our operations properly.\nWe intend to continue exploring opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance, or expand our current business or product lines, or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty finding such opportunities or, if such opportunities are identified, we may not be able to complete such transactions for reasons including a failure to secure necessary financing.\nAny transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including:\n-\nThe diversion of our management's attention from the management of our existing business to the integration of the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture;\n-\nMaterial business risks not identified in due diligence;\n-\nPossible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process;\n-\nSubstantial acquisition-related expenses, which would reduce our net income, if any, in future years;\n-\nThe loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management; and\n-\nOur possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction.\nIn addition, we may not be able to integrate, operate, maintain or manage, successfully or profitably, our newly acquired operations or employees. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies.\nAny of these difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to introduce innovative products, demand for our products may decrease.\nOur future operating results are dependent on our ability to develop, introduce and market innovative products continually, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change and to customize some of our products to meet customer requirements. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely or cost-effective manner to satisfy customer demand.\nOur markets are highly competitive, and we may lose business to larger and better-financed competitors.\nOur markets are highly competitive worldwide, with low transportation costs and few import barriers. We compete principally on the basis of product quality and reliability, availability, customer service, technological innovation, timely delivery and price. Within the industries in which we compete, competition has become increasingly concentrated and global in recent years.\nMany of our major competitors, some of which are larger, and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer support capabilities. If we are unable to successfully compete against current and future competitors, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to borrow under our credit facility may be limited by available collateral.\nOur credit facility includes a revolving loan that requires cash equal to any amounts outstanding to be held as collateral in a deposit account with the lender. Should we not have sufficient cash to be held as collateral, the total amount available to borrow under the revolving loan may be reduced or not available.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain key management and technical personnel and attracting, retaining, and training new technical personnel.\nOur future growth and success will depend in large part upon our ability to recruit highly-skilled technical personnel, including engineers, and to retain our existing management and technical personnel. The labor markets in which we operate are highly competitive and some of our operations are not located in highly populated areas. As a result, we may not be able to recruit and retain key personnel. Our failure to hire, retain or adequately train key personnel could have a negative impact on our performance.\nWe purchase certain key components and raw materials from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these sources fail to fulfill our needs.\nIf single-source components or key raw materials were to become unavailable on satisfactory terms, and we could not obtain comparable replacement components or raw materials from other sources in a timely manner, our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition could be harmed. On occasion, one or more of the components used in our products have become unavailable, resulting in unanticipated redesign and related delays in shipments. We cannot give assurance that similar delays will not occur in the future. Our suppliers may be impacted by compliance with environmental regulations including Restriction of Hazardous Substances (\"RoHS\") and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\"WEEE\"), which could disrupt the supply of components or raw materials or cause additional costs for us to implement new components or raw materials into our manufacturing processes.\nAs a supplier to U.S. Government defense contractors, we are subject to a number of procurement regulations and other requirements and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a U.S. audit or investigation.\nA number of our customers are U.S. Government contractors. As one of their suppliers, we must comply with significant procurement regulations and other requirements. We also maintain registration under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for all of our production facilities. One of those production facilities must comply with additional requirements and regulations for its production processes and for selected personnel in order to maintain the security of classified information. These requirements, although customary within these markets, increase our performance and compliance costs. If any of these various requirements change, our costs of complying with them could increase and reduce our operating margins.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. Government and its agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\") and Defense Contract Management Agency (\"DCMA\"). These agencies review our performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies. Systems that are subject to review include our purchasing systems, billing systems, property management and control systems, cost estimating systems, compensation systems and management information systems.\nAny costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension, or prohibition from doing business as a supplier to contractors who sell products and services to the U.S. Government. In addition, our reputation could be adversely affected if allegations of impropriety were made against us.\nFrom time to time, we may also be subject to U.S. Government investigations relating to our or our customers' operations and products, and are expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of federal laws, including the Truth in Negotiations Act, the False Claims Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We or our customers may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, or result in a diminution in revenue from our customers, if we or our customers are found to have violated the law or are indicted or convicted for violations of federal laws related to government security regulations, employment practices or protection of the environment, or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law. Such convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from serving as a supplier to government contractors for some period of time. Such convictions or actions could have a material adverse effect on us and our operating results. The costs of cooperating or complying with such audits or investigations may also adversely impact our financial results.\nOur products are complex and may contain errors or design flaws, which could be costly to correct.\nWhen we release new products, or new versions of existing products, they may contain undetected or unresolved errors or defects. The vast majority of our products are custom-designed for requirements of specific OEM systems. The expected business life of these products ranges from less than one year to more than 10 years depending on the application. Some of the customizations are modest changes to existing product designs while others are major product redesigns or new product platforms.\nDespite testing, errors or defects may be found in new products or upgrades after the commencement of commercial shipments. Undetected errors and design flaws have occurred in the past and could occur in the future. These errors could result in delays, loss of market acceptance and sales, diversion of development resources, damage to the Company's reputation, product liability claims and legal action by its customers and third parties, failure to attract new customers and increased service costs.\nCommunications and network infrastructure equipment manufacturers increasingly rely upon contract manufacturers, thereby diminishing our ability to sell our products directly to those equipment manufacturers.\nThere is a continuing trend among communications and network infrastructure equipment manufacturers to outsource the manufacturing of their equipment or components. As a result, our ability to persuade these OEMs to utilize our products in customer designs could be reduced and, in the absence of a manufacturer's specification of our products, the prices that we can charge for them may be subject to greater competition.\nFuture changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may increase costs and decrease profitability.\nOur present and past manufacturing operations, products, and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and other chemicals. In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance that would be associated with these regulations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may cause us to change our manufacturing processes, redesign some of our products, and change components to eliminate some substances in our products in order to be able to continue to offer them for sale.\nWe have significant international operations and sales to customers outside of the United States that subject us to certain business, economic and political risks.\nWe have office and manufacturing space in Noida, India, and a sales office in Hong Kong. Additionally, foreign revenues for 2017 and 2016 (primarily to Malaysia) accounted for 28.2% and 28.7% of our 2017 and 2016 consolidated revenues, respectively. We anticipate that sales to customers located outside of the United States will continue to be a significant part of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Our international operations and sales to customers outside of the United States subject our operating results and financial condition to certain business, economic, political, health, regulatory and other risks, including:\n-\nPolitical and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured and sold;\n-\nExpropriation or the imposition of government controls;\n-\nSanctions or restrictions on trade imposed by the United States government;\n-\nExport license requirements;\n-\nTrade restrictions;\n-\nCurrency controls or fluctuations in exchange rates;\n-\nHigh levels of inflation or deflation;\n-\nGreater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;\n-\nChanges in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n-\nLimitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters and business operations.\nAdditionally, to date, very few of our international revenue and cost obligations have been denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, changes in the value of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies may affect our competitiveness in foreign markets. We do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities, but may do so in the future to the extent that we incur a significant amount of foreign-currency denominated liabilities.\nWe rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, and disruption, failure or security breaches of these systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology (\"IT\") systems in order to achieve our business objectives. We also rely upon industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential information maintained on our IT systems. However, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other malicious software programs. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated considerably and is likely to remain volatile, in part due to the limited market for our common stock.\nFrom January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the high and low closing sales prices for our common stock were $6.70 and $4.25, respectively, and the average daily trading volume in our common stock during that time period was approximately 14,250 shares per day. There is a limited public market for our common stock, and we cannot provide assurances that a more active trading market will develop or be sustained. As a result of limited trading volume in our common stock, the purchase or sale of a relatively small number of shares could result in significant price fluctuations and it may be difficult for holders to sell their shares without depressing the market price for our common stock.\nAdditionally, the market prices of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n-\nGeneral economic conditions affecting the availability of long-term or short-term credit facilities, the purchasing and payment patterns of our customers, or the requirements imposed by our suppliers;\n-\nEconomic conditions in our industry and in the industries of our customers and suppliers;\n-\nChanges in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts relating to our common stock;\n-\nMarket reaction to our reported financial results;\n-\nLoss of a major customer;\n-\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and\n-\nChanges in key personnel.\nOur warrants expiring August 6, 2018 may not have any value and there is a limited public market for our warrants.\nOn August 6, 2013, we distributed warrants to purchase shares of our common stock (expiring August 6, 2018) as a dividend to holders of our common stock on July 29, 2013, the record date for the dividend. Stockholders received five warrants for each share of our common stock owned on the record date. When exercisable, 25 warrants will entitle their holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.50 per share (subject to adjustment).\nThere is a limited public market for our warrants, and we cannot provide assurances that an active trading market will develop or be sustained. The warrants are quoted on the over-the-counter market under the symbol \"LGLPW.\" Securities traded on the over-the-counter markets are typically less liquid than securities that trade on a national securities exchange, such as the NYSE American. Trading on the over-the-counter market may negatively affect the trading price and liquidity of the warrants and could result in larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for the warrants. Warrant holders may find it difficult to resell their warrants due to very limited trading volume.\nThe warrants are \"European style warrants\" and will only become exercisable on the earlier of (i) the expiration date, August 6, 2018, and (ii) such date that the 30-day volume weighted average price per share, or VWAP, of our common stock is greater than or equal to $15.00. Once the warrants become exercisable, they may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement until their expiration at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the expiration date.\nThe warrants have an exercise price of $7.50 per share. This exercise price does not necessarily bear any relationship to established criteria for valuation of our common stock, such as book value per share, cash flows, or earnings, and you should not consider this exercise price as an indication of the current or future market price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will exceed $7.50 per share at any time on the expiration date of the warrants, August 6, 2018, or at any other time the warrants may be exercised. If the warrants only become exercisable on the expiration date and the market price of our common stock on such date does not exceed $7.50 per share, the warrants will be of no value.\nThere can be no assurance that the 30-day VWAP of our common stock will be greater than or equal to $15.00 at any time prior to the expiration date of the warrants, August 6, 2018. As a result, the warrants may become exercisable only on the expiration date. If the warrants may be exercised only on the expiration date and their holder does not exercise their warrants on that date, their warrants will expire and be of no value.\nNo warrants will be exercisable unless at the time of exercise a prospectus relating to our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is current and the common stock has been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to meet these conditions and use our best efforts to maintain a current prospectus relating to common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so, and if we do not maintain a current prospectus related to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will be unable to exercise their warrants and we will not be required to settle any such warrant exercise. If the prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not current or if the common stock is not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, we will not be required to net cash settle or cash settle the warrant exercise, the warrants may have no value, the market for the warrants may be limited and the warrants may expire worthless.\nHolders of our warrants will have no rights as a common stockholder until such holders exercise their warrants and acquire shares of our common stock.\nUntil warrant holders acquire shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants, warrant holders will have no rights with respect to the shares of our common stock underlying such warrants. Upon the acquisition of shares of our common stock through exercise of the warrants, the holders thereof will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters for which the record date for the matter occurs after the exercise date of the warrants.\nAdjustments to the exercise price of the warrants, or the number of shares of common stock for which the warrants are exercisable, following certain corporate events may not fully compensate warrant holders for the value they would have received if they held the common stock underlying the warrants at the time of such events.\nThe warrants provide for adjustments to the exercise price of the warrants following a number of corporate events, including (i) our issuance of a stock dividend or the subdivision or combination of our common stock, (ii) our issuance of rights, options or warrants to purchase our common stock at a price below the 10-day VWAP of our common stock, (iii) a distribution of capital stock of the Company or any subsidiary other than our common stock, rights to acquire such capital stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets, (iv) our issuance of a cash dividend on our common stock, and (v) certain tender offers for our common stock by the Company or one or more of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. The warrants also provide for adjustments to the number of shares of common stock for which the warrants are exercisable following our issuance of a stock dividend or the subdivision or combination of our common stock. Any adjustment made to the exercise price of the warrants or the number of shares of common stock for which the warrants are exercisable following a corporate event in accordance with these provisions may not fully compensate warrant holders for the value they would have received if they held the common stock underlying the warrants at the time of the event.\nOur officers, directors and 10% stockholders have significant voting power and may vote their shares in a manner that is not in the best interest of other stockholders.\nOur officers, directors and 10% or greater stockholders control approximately 39.4% of the voting power represented by our outstanding shares of common stock as of March 20, 2018. If these stockholders act together, they may be able to exert significant control over our management and affairs requiring stockholder approval, including approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of all of our stockholders.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\"DGCL\"), may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of the Company, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include prohibiting our stockholders from fixing the number of directors, and establishing advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors (the \"Board\").\nAdditionally, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. We have not opted out of the restrictions under Section 203, as permitted under DGCL.", "PERMNO": 33849, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "LGL"}
