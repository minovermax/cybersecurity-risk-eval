{"cik": "949158", "company": "CRAY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should carefully read and consider the following risk factors. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nOur operating results fluctuate significantly and we may not achieve profitability in any given period. Our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations which make predicting revenue and operating results for any specific period very difficult, particularly because a material portion of product revenue recognized in any given quarter or year typically depends on a limited number of system sales expected for that quarter or year and the product revenue generally depends on the timing of product acceptances by customers and contractual provisions affecting revenue recognition. Receiving less than anticipated customer orders for delivery and acceptance of product for a particular period, delays in achieving customer acceptances of installed systems and recognizing revenue from a product transaction or transactions due to development or product delivery delays, unexpected manufacturing delays or defects, not receiving needed components on time or not receiving them with anticipated quality and performance or the inability of a system to meet performance requirements or targets or other contractual obligations, among other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in any specific quarter or year, such as by reducing or delaying associated revenue, gross profit and cash receipts from one quarter to another, or even from one year to another in the case of revenue expected to be realized in the fourth quarter of any year, as occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, because our revenue can be concentrated in particular quarters, often the fourth quarter, rather than evenly spread throughout a year, we generally do not expect to sustain profitability over successive quarters even if we are profitable for the year.\nAlthough we have recorded positive annual net income since 2010, we experienced net losses in earlier periods and could experience a net loss in any future year in addition to quarterly losses. Net income may fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors, including as a result of significant investments we may make to grow our business even though the benefits of those investments often require many years to come to fruition and may not be realized when expected or at all. For example, we anticipate incurring significant expenditures in connection with the expansion of our facilities and continued investments in research and development. Due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature, certain of the costs associated with these potential projects may be higher than estimated and it may take longer than expected to complete, if at all. In addition, while we were profitable in 2016, our revenue and profitability declined year over year, driven in part by a slow-down in the high-end of the supercomputing market. It is uncertain whether or when the high-end of the supercomputing market will rebound and resume growing.\nWhether we will be able to increase our revenue and achieve and sustain profitability on a quarterly and annual basis depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to secure sufficient orders for our Cray XC and Cray CS systems as well as upgrades and successor systems, such as our next generation \u201cShasta\u201d system;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully delivering and obtaining sufficient customer acceptances of our Cray XC and Cray CS systems, including attached Sonexion storage systems;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully generate revenue and profitability from sales of our analytics and storage and data management products, as well as upgrades and successor systems;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully and timely design for, procure and integrate competitive processors for our Cray XC and Cray CS systems and upgrades and successor systems;\n\u2022\nour expense levels, including research and development expense net of government funding;\n\u2022\ndelays in delivery of upgraded or new systems, longer than expected customer acceptance cycles or penalties resulting from system acceptance issues;\n\u2022\nour ability to efficiently scale our internal processes to meet necessary peak requirements and growth in our business;\n\u2022\nthe level of revenue recognized in any given period, which is affected by the very high average sales prices and limited number of significant system sales and resulting potential acceptances in any quarter, the timing of product orders and acceptances by customers and contractual provisions affecting the timing and amount of revenue recognition;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to broaden our customer base beyond our traditional customers;\n\u2022\nrevenue delays or losses due to customers postponing purchases as a result of delays in available budgets or waiting times related to the availability of future upgraded or new systems, including those containing new processors;\n\u2022\nthe level of product gross profit contribution in any given period due to volume, competition or product mix, particularly with the introduction of flexible commodity-based supercomputers, competitive factors, strategic transactions, product life cycle, currency fluctuations, acceptance penalties and component costs;\n\u2022\nthe competitiveness of our products, services and prices;\n\u2022\nour ability to secure additional government funding for future development projects;\n\u2022\nmaintaining and successfully completing our product development projects on schedule and within budgetary limitations;\n\u2022\nour ability to resolve and the costs incurred in connection with any actual or alleged issues with our products, including third-party components of such products, such as those that relate to product defects or intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of maintenance contract renewals with existing customers; and\n\u2022\nthe terms and conditions of sale or lease for our products and services.\nThe receipt of orders and the timing of shipments and acceptances impacts our quarterly and annual results, including cash flows, and is affected by events outside our control, such as:\n\u2022\nwhether or when the high-end of the supercomputing market, which is currently experiencing a slow-down, rebounds and resumes growing;\n\u2022\nthe timely availability of acceptable components, including, but not limited to, processors, in sufficient quantities to meet customer delivery schedules and other customer commitments at a competitive cost;\n\u2022\nthe timing and level of government funding and resources available for product acquisitions and research and development contracts, which have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the current global economic and fiscal uncertainties, increased governmental budgetary limitations and disruptions in the operations of the United States and other governments;\n\u2022\ncompetitor and supplier pricing strategies;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, international conflicts or economic crises, including the ongoing economic challenges in the United States, Japan and Europe, and fluctuations in oil prices that can affect the resources available to potential customers to purchase products;\n\u2022\nnew tariffs or taxes imposed on components and products sourced or manufactured outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nthe introduction or announcement of competitive or key industry supplier products;\n\u2022\nprice fluctuations or product shortages in the processors and other commodity electronics and memory markets;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate customer facilities to install and operate new Cray systems;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic trends, including changes in levels of customer capital spending; and\n\u2022\nour customers\u2019 ability to make future payments in accordance with contractual terms of their purchase or sales-type lease agreements.\nBecause of the numerous factors affecting our revenue and results of operations, we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We anticipate that our quarterly results will fluctuate significantly, and include losses, even in years where we expect or achieve positive annual net income. Delays in the availability of acceptable third-party components, product development, receipt of orders, product acceptances, issues with third-party component performance or reliability, reductions in outside funding for our research and development efforts, a reduction in the size of the high-end of the supercomputing market, the level and timing of approved government fiscal budgets and achieving contractual development milestones have had a substantial adverse effect on our past results and are expected to continue to have such an effect on our results in 2017 and in future years.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop, sell and deliver our Cray XC systems and successor systems, such as our next generation Shasta system, and recognize revenue for these systems, our operating results will be adversely affected. We expect that a substantial portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future will come from acceptances of delivered Cray XC systems and successor systems, such as our next generation Shasta system, including systems integrating future processors and accelerators where we are dependent upon third-party suppliers to deliver according to expected plans. The development efforts related to these systems are lengthy and technically challenging processes, and require a significant investment of capital, engineering and other resources often years ahead of the time when we can be assured that they will result in competitive products. We may invest\nsignificant resources that may prove ultimately unsuccessful. Unanticipated performance and/or development issues may require more engineers, time or testing resources than are currently available. Given the breadth of our engineering challenges, changes in the market and technology and our limited engineering and technical personnel resources, we periodically review the anticipated contributions and expense of our product programs to determine their long-term viability, and we may substantially modify or terminate one or more development programs. We may not be successful in meeting our development schedules for technical reasons, including those related to our dependence on third-party suppliers of components such as processors and accelerators, and/or because of insufficient engineering resources, which could result in an uncompetitive product or cause a lack of confidence in our capabilities among our key customers. To the extent that we incur delays in completing the design, development and production of hardware components, delays in development of requisite system software, cancellation of or changes to programs due to technical or economic infeasibility, inability to source acceptable third-party components such as processors and accelerators or investment in unproductive development efforts, our revenue, results of operations and cash flows, and the reputation of such systems in the market, could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, many factors affect our ability to successfully sell and recognize revenue for these systems, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe level of product differentiation in our Cray XC systems and successor systems, such as our next generation Shasta system. We need to compete successfully against HPC systems from both large, established companies and smaller companies and demonstrate the value of our balanced, tightly integrated systems to our customers in a variety of markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet all customer requirements for acceptance. Even once a system has been delivered, we sometimes do not meet all of the contract requirements for customer acceptance and ongoing reliability of our systems within the provided-for acceptance period, which has resulted in contract penalties and delays in our ability to recognize revenue from system deliveries. Most often these penalties have adversely affected revenue and gross profit at the time of revenue recognition through the provision of additional equipment and services and/or service credits to satisfy delivery delays and performance shortfalls. The risk of contract penalties is increased when we bid for new business prior to us or our suppliers completing development of new products and when we must estimate future system performance, such as has been required with our Cray XC systems and our Sonexion storage systems, and will be frequently required for subsequent systems, such as our next generation Shasta system;\n\u2022\nour ability to source competitive, key components in appropriate quantities (to have enough to sell without ending up with excess inventory that can lead to obsolescence charges), in a timely fashion and on acceptable terms and conditions and that meet the performance criteria required; and\n\u2022\nwhether potential customers delay purchases of our products because they decide to wait for successor systems or upgrades that we or our suppliers have announced or they believe will be available in the future.\nFailure to successfully develop and sell our Cray XC systems and successor systems, such as our next generation Shasta system, into the supercomputing market and recognize revenue for such systems will adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our current and future products targeting markets outside of our traditional markets, primarily products targeting the big data and commercial markets, are not successful, our ability to grow or even maintain our revenues and achieve and sustain profitability will be adversely affected. Our ability to materially grow or even maintain our revenues and achieve and sustain profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from products targeting markets outside of our traditional markets, including if those market segments do not grow significantly. We are currently focusing on big data analytics, artificial intelligence and storage and data management opportunities as well as the commercial market for all of our products. To grow our revenue from opportunities outside our primary markets, we must successfully and in a cost-effective manner design and develop products utilizing technologies different from our traditional supercomputing products, compete successfully with many established companies and new entrants in these markets, continue to win awards for new contracts, timely perform on existing contracts, develop our capability for broader market sales and business development and successfully develop and introduce new solution-oriented offerings, notwithstanding that these are relatively new businesses for us and we do not have significant experience targeting these markets. Big data analytics, artificial intelligence and storage and data management opportunities require significant monetary investments ahead of revenue, including product development efforts, adding experienced personnel and initiating new marketing and sales efforts and therefore may reduce net income in the short term even if successful.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers poses significant risks to our operating results, business and prospects. We rely upon third-party vendors, particularly Intel, to supply processors, including accelerators, and for most of the products, we sell and use service providers to co-develop key technologies. We subcontract the manufacturing of a majority of the hardware components for our high-end products, including integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, memory parts, cables and power supplies, on a sole\nor limited source basis to third-party suppliers. We use contract manufacturers to assemble certain important components for all of our systems. We also rely on third parties to supply key software and hardware capabilities, such as file systems, solution-specific servers and storage subsystems, and in the case of our Sonexion products, we rely on third-party original equipment manufacturers to supply complete storage systems. Because specific components must be designed into our systems well in advance of initial deliveries of those systems, we are particularly reliant on our processor vendors, particularly Intel, to deliver on the capabilities and pricing expected at the time we design key elements of the system and make binding bids to customers. We are subject to substantial risks because of our reliance on these and other limited or sole source suppliers, including the following risks:\n\u2022\nif a supplier does not provide components or systems that meet our or their specifications in sufficient quantities and with acceptable performance or quality on time or deliver when required, or delays future components or systems beyond anticipated delivery dates, then sales, production, delivery, acceptance and revenue from our systems could be delayed and/or reduced and we could be subject to costly penalties even once delivered and accepted, which has happened multiple times in the past and has at times significantly lowered our revenue for a particular quarter or year;\n\u2022\nif our relationship with a key supplier, such as Intel, is adversely affected, for example, due to competitive pressures (or conflicting interests), our ability to obtain components on competitive financial terms could be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nif a supplier cannot provide a competitive key component, for example, due to inadequate performance or a prohibitive price, or eliminates key features from components, such as with the processors we design into our systems, our systems may be less competitive than systems using components with greater capabilities;\n\u2022\nif an interruption of supply of our components, services or capabilities occurs because a supplier changes its technology roadmap, suffers damage to its manufacturing facilities, decides to no longer provide those products or services, increases the price of those products or services significantly or imposes reduced delivery allocations on its customers, it could take us a considerable period of time to identify and qualify alternative suppliers, to redesign our products as necessary and to begin to manufacture the redesigned components or otherwise obtain those services or capabilities. In some cases, such as with key integrated circuits and memory parts or processors, we may not be able to redesign such components or find alternate sources that we could use in any realistic timeframe;\n\u2022\nif a supplier plans future processors that are made available in a way that encourages customers to delay purchases of our products because they decide to wait for successor systems or upgrades they believe will be available in the future or to purchase products with the future processors from our competitors who are willing to take greater risk on delivery;\n\u2022\nif Cray systems at customer sites develop significant issues with third-party components, as has occurred, the cost to Cray to repair or replace the components or otherwise address such issue may be material. If we are unable to effectively address such problem or a problem causes customer disruption, our relationship with our customers may also be harmed;\n\u2022\nif a supplier of a component is subject to a claim that the component infringes a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, as has happened with multiple suppliers, our ability to obtain necessary components could be adversely affected or our cost to obtain such components could increase significantly;\n\u2022\nif a supplier providing us with key research and development and design services or core technology components with respect to integrated circuit design, network communication capabilities or software is late, fails to provide us with effective functionality or loses key internal talent, our development programs may be delayed or prove to be impossible to complete;\n\u2022\nif a supplier provides us with hardware or software that contains bugs or other errors or defects, or is different from what we expected, our development projects and production systems may be adversely affected through reduced performance or capabilities, additional design testing and verification efforts, re-spins of integrated circuits and/or development of replacement components, and the production and sales of our systems could be delayed and systems installed at customer sites could require significant, expensive field component replacements or result in penalties;\n\u2022\nsome of our key component and service suppliers are small companies with limited financial and other resources, and consequently may be more likely to experience financial and operational difficulties than larger, well-established companies, which increases the risk that they will be unable to deliver products as needed; and\n\u2022\nif a key supplier is acquired or has a significant business change, as has occurred in the past with the acquisition of the third-party original equipment manufacturer that supplies complete storage systems for our Sonexion product,\nthe production and sales of our systems and services may be delayed or adversely affected, or our development programs may be delayed or may be impossible to complete.\nDelays in the availability of components with acceptable performance, features and reliability, or our inability to obtain such acceptable components in the quantities we need or at all, and increases in prices and order lead times for certain components, have occurred in the past, and we are currently experiencing increased delivery timelines of memory and other key components. These types of issues have adversely affected our revenue and operating results in multiple prior periods, in some cases significantly, and could adversely affect future results.\nThe continuing commoditization of HPC hardware and software has resulted in increased pricing pressure and may adversely affect our operating results. The continuing commoditization of HPC hardware, such as processors, interconnects, storage and other infrastructure, and the growing commoditization of software, including plentiful building blocks and more capable open source software, as well as the potential for integration of differentiated technology into already-commoditized components, has resulted in, and may result in increased pricing pressure that may cause us to reduce our pricing in order to remain competitive, which can negatively impact our gross margins and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf the U.S. government and other governments purchase, or fund the purchase of, fewer supercomputers or delay such purchases, our revenue would be reduced and our operating results would be adversely affected. Historically, sales to the U.S. Government have represented the largest single market segment for supercomputer sales worldwide, including our products and services. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, approximately 48%, 47% and 47%, respectively, of our total revenue was derived from such sales. Our plans for the foreseeable future contemplate significant sales to the U.S. Government. Sales to the U.S. Government and other governments, including further sales pursuant to existing contracts, have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by factors outside our control, such as by:\n\u2022\nuncertainties relating to priorities of the new administration or adverse decisions by the new administration to reduce or eliminate budgets for governmental agencies or departments that purchase or fund the purchase of our products and services;\n\u2022\nCongressional decisions in addressing budget concerns and current economic uncertainty;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the operations of the U.S. government, including impacts of the new administration;\n\u2022\n\u201csequestration\u201d;\n\u2022\nthe downgrading of U.S. government debt or the possibility of such action;\n\u2022\nthe political climate in the U.S. focusing on cutting or limiting budgets and its affect on government budgets;\n\u2022\nthe limits on federal borrowing capacity;\n\u2022\nchanges in procurement policies;\n\u2022\nbudgetary considerations, including Congressional delays in completing appropriation bills as has occurred in the past and which is the case right now as Congress is operating under a Continuing Resolution at fiscal year 2016 levels until April 28, 2017;\n\u2022\ndomestic crises;\n\u2022\npolitical efforts to limit the activities of U.S. intelligence community agencies, including proposed state legislation that would limit or even criminalize doing business with the NSA for certain companies doing business with state governments; and\n\u2022\ninternational political developments, such as the downgrading of European debt or the U.K. \u201cBrexit\u201d vote.\nIf agencies and departments of the United States or other governments were to stop, reduce or delay their use and purchases of supercomputers, our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected.\nIf our cluster systems are not successful, our operating results will be adversely affected. Our cluster products were first introduced in late 2012. We have had relatively limited experience selling cluster-based solutions, including into the same markets we sell our core supercomputers, and if we cannot successfully sell these solutions with acceptable margins, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe may infringe or be subject to claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We are and may in the future be subject to patent infringement and other intellectual property claims and lawsuits in various jurisdictions, and we cannot be certain that our products or activities do not violate the patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights of third-party claimants. Companies in the technology industry and other patent, copyright, and trademark holders seeking to profit from\nroyalties in connection with grants of licenses own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and frequently commence litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the intellectual property rights claims against us have grown and will likely continue to grow. For example, we are currently involved in litigation with Raytheon Company, or Raytheon, which is described in Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe intend to vigorously defend and prosecute these litigation matters and, based on our reviews to date, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to each of these matters. However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against us or any adverse settlement could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. As a result of these or other intellectual property infringement claims, we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to:\n\u2022\npay third-party infringement claims;\n\u2022\ndiscontinue manufacturing, using or selling particular products subject to infringement claims;\n\u2022\ndiscontinue using the technology or processes subject to infringement claims;\n\u2022\ndevelop other technology not subject to infringement claims, which could be time-consuming and costly or may not be possible; and/or\n\u2022\nlicense technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, litigation can involve significant management time and attention and can be expensive, as it has been with Raytheon, regardless of outcome. During the course of these litigation matters, there may be announcements of the results of hearings and motions, and other interim developments related to the litigation matters. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nIf we cannot retain, attract and motivate key personnel, we may be unable to effectively implement our business plan. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to retain, attract and motivate highly skilled management, development, marketing, sales and service personnel. The loss of and failure to replace key technical management and personnel could adversely affect multiple development efforts. Recruitment and retention of senior management and skilled technical, sales and other personnel is very competitive, and we may not be successful in either attracting or retaining such personnel. We have lost key personnel to other high technology companies, and many larger companies with significantly greater resources than us have aggressively recruited, and continue to aggressively recruit, key personnel. As part of our strategy to attract and retain key personnel, we may offer equity compensation through grants of stock options, restricted stock awards or restricted stock units. Potential employees, however, may not perceive our equity incentives as attractive enough. In addition, due to the intense competition for qualified employees, we may be required to, and have had to, increase the level of compensation paid to existing and new employees, which could materially increase our operating expenses.\nWe have made in the past, and may make in the future, acquisitions which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, result in dilution to our shareholders, deplete our cash reserves and adversely affect our financial results. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in successfully integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, offerings and personnel of the acquired company or companies;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\ninitial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; and\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans.\nAcquisitions may also cause us to:\n\u2022\nuse a substantial portion of our cash reserves or incur debt;\n\u2022\nissue equity securities or grant equity incentives to acquired employees that would dilute our current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022\nassume liabilities, including potentially unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nrecord goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u2022\nincur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;\n\u2022\nincur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses; or\n\u2022\nbecome subject to intellectual property litigation or other litigation.\nAcquisitions of high-technology companies and assets are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our recently completed or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully in the highly competitive HPC market, our business will not be successful. The market for HPC systems is very competitive. An increase in competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in pricing reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share and revenue. Many of our competitors are established well known companies in the HPC market, including IBM, HPE, Lenovo, Dell, NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu and Atos. Most of these competitors have substantially greater research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and financial resources than we do. In addition, certain Chinese companies are investing significantly in HPC and are becoming more aggressive and more competitive in the HPC global arena.\nWe also compete with systems builders and resellers of systems that are constructed from commodity components using processors manufactured and/or designed by Intel, ARM, AMD, NVIDIA and others. These competitors include the companies named above, as well as smaller companies that benefit from the low research and development costs needed to assemble systems from commercially available commodity products. Such companies, because they can offer high peak performance per dollar, can put pricing pressure on us in certain competitive procurements. In addition, to the extent that Intel, IBM and other processor suppliers develop processors with greater capabilities or at a lower cost than the processors we currently use, our Cray XC systems may be at a competitive disadvantage to systems utilizing such other processors until we can design in, integrate and secure competitive processors, if at all. Also, to the extent any component supplier successfully adds differentiating capabilities to their HPC products that compete with what we provide, we may experience greater competitive pressures.\nOur growth initiatives in the big data analytics, artificial intelligence and storage and data management markets must also compete successfully with many established companies and new entrants, many of whom have significantly greater resources and brand recognition in these markets than we do.\nPeriodic announcements by our competitors of new HPC, storage or data analytics systems or plans for future systems and price adjustments may reduce customer demand for our products. Many of our potential customers already own or lease high performance computer, storage or data analytics systems. Some of our competitors have offered substantial discounts to potential customers. We have in the past been and may again be required to provide substantial discounts to make strategic sales, which may reduce or eliminate any gross profit on such transactions, or require us to provide lease financing for our products, which could result in a multi-year deferral of our receipt of cash and revenue for these systems. These developments limit our revenue and financial resources and reduce our ability to be profitable and grow.\nWe maintain confidential and proprietary information on our computer networks and employ security measures designed to protect this information from unauthorized access. If our security measures are breached, we could lose proprietary data and may suffer economic losses. We maintain confidential information on our computer networks, including information and data that are proprietary to our customers and third parties, as well as to us. Although we have designed and employed and continue to enhance a multitude of security measures to protect this information from unauthorized access, security breaches may occur, and in the past have occurred, as a result of third-party action, including computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Security breaches can result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our data or our customers\u2019 data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques employed by hackers to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A security breach could result in disclosure of our trade secrets or disclosure of\nconfidential customer, supplier or employee data. If this should happen, we could be exposed to potentially significant legal liability, remediation expense, harm to our reputation and other harm to our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary information and rights adequately. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection, nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to establish, protect and enforce our proprietary information and rights. We have a number of patents and have additional applications pending. There can be no assurance, however, that patents will be issued from the pending applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect those aspects of our technology to which such patents will relate. Despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that we will succeed in doing so or that our competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the United States. Additionally, under certain conditions, the U.S. government might obtain non-exclusive rights to certain of our intellectual property. Although we continue to implement protective measures and intend to defend our proprietary rights vigorously, these efforts may not be successful.\nWe are subject to market and financial risks due to our international operations that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability and operating results. Our international operations include sales and service offices in Europe, the Middle East, South America, Asia, Australia and Canada. Our operations in countries outside of the United States, which accounted for approximately 46% of our total revenue for 2016, expose us to greater risks associated with international sales and operations. Our profitability and international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:\n\u2022\nsupporting multiple languages;\n\u2022\nrecruiting sales and technical support personnel internationally with the skills to sell and support our products;\n\u2022\ncomplying with governmental regulations, including obtaining required import or export approval for our products;\n\u2022\nincreased complexity and costs of managing international operations;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and business practices that favor local competition;\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles and manufacturing lead times;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner;\n\u2022\nineffective legal protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nmore complicated logistics and distribution arrangements;\n\u2022\nadditional taxes and penalties;\n\u2022\ninadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions;\n\u2022\nglobal political and economic instability; and\n\u2022\nother factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious disease.\nOur global operations are also subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. These laws and regulations are complex and may have differing, conflicting and evolving legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. If we or our employees, contractors or agents violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. Any violations, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union. The negotiated measures could potentially disrupt some of our target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United Kingdom and Germany, such as by adversely affecting tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions or by restricting the movement of employees between the United Kingdom and other countries. Any such changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nCustomers and other third parties may make statements speculating about or announcing the purchase, acceptance or intention to complete purchases or acceptances of our products before such purchases or acceptances are substantially\ncertain, and these proposed purchases or acceptances may not be completed when or as expected, if at all. From time to time, customers and other third parties may make statements speculating about or announcing a potential purchase of our products before we have obtained an order for such purchases or completed negotiations and signed a contract for the purchase of such products. In some instances, government and government-funded customers may announce possible purchases even before they have obtained the necessary budget to procure the products. As a result, these statements, postings or announcements do not mean that we will ultimately be able to secure the sale when or as expected or at all as it is not certain that the contract or order negotiations will be completed successfully or as expected or that the customer will be able to obtain the budget they hope for or expect. In addition, from time to time, customers and other third parties may make statements speculating about or announcing the completion of an acceptance process of a delivery system before such acceptance is completed or certain. As a result, these statements or announcements do not mean that we will ultimately be able to obtain the acceptance when or as expected or recognize revenue.\nWe are subject to increasing government regulations and other requirements due to the nature of our business, which may adversely affect our business operations. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, approximately 48%, 47% and 47%, respectively, of our total revenue was derived from the U.S. Government. In addition to normal business risks, our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to particular risks, including:\nThe funding of U.S. government programs is subject to Congressional appropriations. Many of the U.S. government programs in which we participate may extend for several years; however, these programs are normally funded annually. Changes in U.S. strategy and priorities may affect our future procurement opportunities and existing programs. Long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation, or delay, if appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. The termination of funding for existing or new U.S. government programs could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts with us. The U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice at its convenience upon payment for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. Modification, curtailment or termination of our major programs or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur U.S. government contract costs are subject to audits by U.S. government agencies. U.S. government representatives may audit the costs we incur on our U.S. government contracts, including allocated indirect costs. Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. If any audit uncovers improper or illegal activities or non-compliance with the terms of a specific contract, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government.\nOur business is subject to potential U.S. government inquiries and investigations. We may be subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations of our business practices due to our participation in government contracts. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur U.S. government business is also subject to specific procurement regulations and other requirements. These requirements, although customary in U.S. government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, reducing our margins, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time and could have a negative effect on our reputation and ability to secure future U.S. government contracts.\nU.S. export controls could hinder our ability to make sales to foreign customers and our future prospects. The U.S. government regulates the export of HPC systems such as our products. We have experienced delays for up to several months in receiving appropriate approvals necessary for certain sales, which have delayed the shipment of our products. Delay or denial in the granting of any required licenses could make it more difficult to make sales to certain foreign customers, eliminating an important source of potential revenue. Restrictions on the export of information needed to manufacture our products has in the past impacted and could in the future impact our ability to have certain products and components made in certain lower cost jurisdictions\nOur stock price is volatile. The trading price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to many factors, including stock market trends and shareholder profile, our quarterly operating results, changes in analysts\u2019 estimates or our outlook, our capital raising activities, announcements of technological innovations and customer contracts by us or our competitors, a significant aggressive seller or buyer, litigation activities, general economic conditions and conditions in our industry. From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, the closing sales price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market\nranged from $18.40 to $43.06 per share, and had a low closing price of $16.35 per share during the period from January 1, 2017 through February 9, 2017. Because our stock price has been volatile, investing in our common stock is risky.\nWe incorporate software licensed from third parties into the operating systems for our products as well as in our tools to design products and any significant interruption in the availability of these third-party software products or defects in these products could reduce the demand for our products or cause delay in development. The operating system as well as other software we develop for our supercomputers contains components that are licensed to us under open source software licenses. Our business could be disrupted if this software, or functional equivalents of this software, were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms. In either case we would be required to redesign our operating system software to function with alternative third-party software, or develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in product shipments. Our supercomputer systems utilize software system variants that incorporate Linux technology. The open source licenses under which we have obtained certain components of our operating system software may not be enforceable. Any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable, or that Linux-based operating systems, or significant portions of them, may not be copied, modified or distributed as provided in those licenses, would adversely affect our ability to sell our systems. In addition, as a result of concerns about the risks of litigation and open source software generally, we may be forced to protect our customers from potential claims of infringement. In any such event, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe also incorporate proprietary incidental software from third parties, such as for file systems, job scheduling and storage subsystems. We have experienced some functional issues in the past with implementing such software with our supercomputer systems. In addition, we may not be able to secure needed software systems on acceptable terms, which may make our systems less attractive to potential customers. These issues may result in lost revenue, additional expense by us and/or loss of customer confidence.\nThe \u201cconflict minerals\u201d rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, has caused us to incur additional expenses, could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products, and could make us less competitive in our target markets. On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosure by public companies of the origin, source and chain of custody of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by us. The rule requires companies to obtain sourcing data from suppliers, engage in supply chain due diligence, and file annually with the SEC a specialized disclosure report on Form SD covering the prior calendar year. Implementation of our conflict minerals policy could limit our ability to source at competitive prices and to secure sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, specifically tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten, as the number of suppliers that provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, material costs associated with complying with the conflict minerals rule, such as costs related to the determination of the origin, source and chain of custody of the minerals used in our products, the adoption of conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls, and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities. Within our supply chain, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the data collection and due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. Furthermore, we may encounter challenges in satisfying those customers that require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free, and if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor\u2019s products. We continue to investigate the presence of conflict materials within our supply chain.\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 at the end of each fiscal year, and any adverse results from such future evaluations could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports on Form 10-K as to whether we have any material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. Depending on their nature and severity, any future material weaknesses could result in our having to restate financial statements, could make it difficult or impossible for us to obtain an audit of our annual financial statements or could result in a qualification of any such audit. In such events, we could experience a number of adverse consequences, including our inability to comply with applicable reporting and listing requirements, a loss of market confidence in our publicly available information, delisting from The NASDAQ Global Market, an inability to complete a financing, loss of other financing sources such as our line of credit, and litigation based on the events themselves or their consequences.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles.\nA change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nProvisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws could make a proposed acquisition of our business that is not approved by our Board of Directors more difficult. Provisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock. For example, our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for:\n\u2022\nremoval of a director only in limited circumstances and only upon the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote to elect directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without shareholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting of shares;\n\u2022\nthe right of shareholders to call a special meeting of the shareholders only upon demand by the holders of not less than 30% of the shares entitled to vote at such a meeting;\n\u2022\nthe affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on an amendment, unless the amendment was approved by a majority of our continuing directors, who are defined as directors who have either served as a director since August 31, 1995, or were nominated to be a director by the continuing directors;\n\u2022\nspecial voting requirements for mergers and other business combinations, unless the proposed transaction was approved by a majority of continuing directors;\n\u2022\nspecial procedures to bring matters before our shareholders at our annual shareholders\u2019 meeting; and\n\u2022\nspecial procedures to nominate members for election to our Board of Directors.\nThese provisions could delay, defer or prevent a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business transaction between us and a third-party that is not approved by our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 82287, "SIC": 3571, "TIC": "CRAY"}
