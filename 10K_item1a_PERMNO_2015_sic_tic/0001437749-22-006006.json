{"cik": "1035976", "company": "FNCB Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe operations and financial results of FNCB are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones FNCB faces. Additional risks and uncertainties FNCB is unaware of, or currently believes are not material, may also become important factors affecting FNCB. If any of the following risks occur, FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of the FNCB\u2019s common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to FNCB\u2019s Business\nWeakness in the economic environment, in general, and within FNCB\u2019s market area could pose significant challenges for FNCB and could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB\u2019s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the specific local markets in which it operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, FNCB provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Lackawanna, Luzerne, and Wayne County markets. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for FNCB\u2019s products and services as well as the ability of customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and the stability of deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, severe weather or natural disasters, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, weakness in economic conditions could result in one or more of the following:\n\u25cf\nA decrease in the demand for FNCB's loans and other products and services;\n\u25cf\nA decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for FNCB's savings and other deposit products; and\n\u25cf\nAn increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations.\nAn increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of non-performing assets, net charge-offs, and provision for loan and lease losses. The markets FNCB serves are dependent on retail and service-related businesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors.\nTo the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their obligations to the Bank in full, in a timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses to the Bank. To the extent that loans are secured by real estate, adverse conditions in the real estate market may reduce the ability of the borrowers to generate the necessary cash flow for repayment of the loan, and reduce the ability to collect the full amount of the loan upon a default. To the extent that the Bank makes fixed-rate loans, general increases in interest rates will tend to reduce its spread as the interest rates FNCB must pay for deposits would increase while interest income is flat. Economic conditions and interest rates may also adversely affect the value of property pledged as security for loans.\nFNCB is subject to credit risk, which could adversely affect its profitability.\nFNCB\u2019s business depends on its ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. As a lender, FNCB is exposed to the risk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be paid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover FNCB\u2019s outstanding exposure. In addition, FNCB is exposed to risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual loans and borrowers. The creditworthiness of a borrower is affected by many factors including local market conditions and general economic conditions. If the overall economic climate in the United States generally, or in the market areas in which FNCB operates specifically, experiences material disruption, FNCB\u2019s borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral FNCB holds may decrease in value or become illiquid, and FNCB\u2019s level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for loan losses.\nFNCB\u2019s risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentrations of its loans and its credit approval, review and administrative practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and FNCB\u2019s credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting related customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. Many of FNCB\u2019s loans are made to small businesses that are less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. Consequently, FNCB may have significant exposure if any of these borrowers becomes unable to pay their loan obligations as a result of economic or market conditions, or personal circumstances, such as divorce, unemployment or death. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs, and may necessitate that FNCB significantly increase its allowance for loan losses, each of which could adversely affect FNCB\u2019s net income. As a result, FNCB\u2019s inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 41.5% of FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans and construction, land acquisition and development loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having a higher risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. Because FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. All non-performing loans totaled $3.9 million, or 0.39% of total gross loans, as of December 31, 2021, and $5.6 million, or 0.62% of total gross loans, as of December 31, 2020. Specifically, commercial real estate loans that were non-performing totaled $2.5 million, or 0.25%, of total gross loans, as of December 31, 2021, and $3.2 million, or 0.36%, of total gross loans, as of December 31, 2020. There were no construction, land acquisition and development loans that were non-performing at December 31, 2021 and 2020. An increase in non-performing loans in the future could result in an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The lending activities in which the Bank engages carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations. As such, general economic conditions, nationally and in FNCB\u2019s primary market area, will have a significant impact on its results of operations.\nFNCB\u2019s concentrations of loans, including those to insiders and related parties, may create a greater risk of loan defaults and losses.\nA substantial portion of FNCB\u2019s loans are secured by real estate in the Northeastern Pennsylvania market, and substantially all of its loans are to borrowers in that area. FNCB also has a significant amount of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, construction, land acquisition and development loans and land-related loans for residential and commercial developments. At December 31, 2021, $641.8 million, or 65.4%, of gross loans were secured by real estate, primarily commercial real estate. Management has taken steps to mitigate commercial real estate concentration risk by diversification among the types and characteristics of real estate collateral properties, sound underwriting practices, and ongoing portfolio monitoring and market analysis. Of total gross loans, $41.6 million, or 4.2%, were construction, land acquisition and development loans. Construction, land acquisition and development loans have the highest risk of uncollectability. An additional $193.1 million, or 19.7%, of portfolio loans were commercial and industrial loans not secured by real estate. Historically, commercial and industrial loans generally have had a higher risk of default than other categories of loans, such as single-family residential mortgage loans. The repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business and are more likely to be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions. While management believes that the loan portfolio is well diversified in terms of borrowers and industries, these concentrations expose FNCB to the risk that adverse developments in the real estate market, or in the general economic conditions in its general market area, could increase the levels of non-performing loans and charge-offs, and reduce loan demand. In that event, FNCB would likely experience lower earnings or losses. Additionally, if, for any reason, economic conditions in its market area deteriorate, or there is significant volatility or weakness in the economy or any significant sector of the area\u2019s economy, FNCB\u2019s ability to develop business relationships may be diminished, the quality and collectability of its loans may be adversely affected, the value of collateral may decline and loan demand may be reduced.\nCommercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction, land acquisition and development loans tend to have larger balances than single family mortgage loans and other consumer loans. Because FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans and construction, land acquisition and development loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in non-performing assets. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which could have an adverse impact on FNCB\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nGuidance adopted by federal banking regulators provides that banks having concentrations in construction, land development or commercial real estate loans are expected to have and maintain higher levels of risk management and, potentially, higher levels of capital, which may adversely affect shareholder returns, or require FNCB to obtain additional capital sooner than it otherwise would. Excluded from the scope of this guidance are loans secured by non-farm nonresidential properties where the primary source of repayment is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the party, or affiliate of the party, who owns the property.\nOutstanding loans and line of credit balances to directors, officers and their related parties totaled $71.4 million as of December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, there were no loans to directors, officers and their related parties that were categorized as criticized loans within the Bank\u2019s risk rating system, meaning they are not considered to present a higher risk of collection than other loans. See Note 11, \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Item 13, \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding loans to officers and directors and/or their related parties\nFNCB\u2019s portfolio of loans to small and mid-sized community-based businesses may increase its credit risk.\nMany of FNCB\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the market area in which FNCB operates negatively impact this important customer sector, FNCB\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by FNCB in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. The deterioration of FNCB\u2019s borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with FNCB, which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe appraisals and other valuation techniques FNCB uses in evaluating and monitoring loans secured by real property and other real estate owned may not accurately reflect the net value of the asset.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, FNCB generally requires an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and, as real estate values may change significantly in relatively short periods of time (especially in periods of heightened economic uncertainty), this estimate may not accurately reflect the net value of the collateral after the loan is made. As a result, FNCB may not be able to realize the full amount of any remaining indebtedness when FNCB forecloses on and sells the relevant property. In addition, FNCB relies on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d), that FNCB acquires through foreclosure proceedings and to determine loan impairments. If any of these valuations are inaccurate, FNCB\u2019s financial statements may not reflect the correct value of FNCB\u2019s OREO, if any, and FNCB\u2019s allowance for loan and lease losses may not reflect accurate loan impairments. Inaccurate valuation of OREO or inaccurate provisioning for loan and lease losses could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected if the ALLL is not sufficient to absorb actual losses or if increases to the ALLL were required.\nThe lending activities in which the Bank engages carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations, and that the collateral securing the payment of their obligations may be insufficient to assure repayment. FNCB may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of its loans, which it uses as a basis to estimate and establish its reserves for losses. In determining the amount of the ALLL, management reviews loans, loss and delinquency experience, and evaluates current economic conditions. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, the ALLL may not cover inherent losses in FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio at the date of its financial statements. Material additions to FNCB\u2019s allowance or extensive charge-offs would materially decrease its net income. At December 31, 2021, the ALLL totaled $12.4 million, representing 1.27% of loans, net of unearned income and net deferred loan origination fees.\nAlthough management believes FNCB\u2019s underwriting standards are adequate to manage normal lending risks, it is difficult to assess the future performance of its loan portfolio due to the ongoing economic environment and the state of the real estate market. The assessment of future performance of the loan portfolio is inherently uncertain. FNCB can give no assurance that non-performing loans will not increase or that non-performing or delinquent loans will not adversely affect its future performance.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the ALLL and may require increases to the ALLL or further loan charge-offs. Any increase in ALLL or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIf management concludes that the decline in value of any of FNCB\u2019s investment securities is other-than-temporary, FNCB is required to write down the security to reflect credit-related impairments through a charge to earnings.\nManagement reviews FNCB\u2019s investment securities portfolio at each quarter-end reporting period to determine whether the fair value is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of FNCB\u2019s debt investment securities has declined below its carrying value, management is required to assess whether the decline represents an other than temporary impairment. If management concludes that the decline is other-than-temporary, it is required to write down the value of that security to reflect the credit-related impairments through a charge to earnings. Changes in the expected cash flows of securities in FNCB\u2019s portfolio and/or prolonged price declines in future periods may result in OTTI, which would require a charge to earnings. Due to the complexity of the calculations and assumptions used in determining whether an asset is impaired, any impairment disclosed may not accurately reflect the actual impairment in the future. In addition, to the extent that the value of any of FNCB\u2019s investment securities is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates, any increase in interest rates may result in a decline in the value of such investment securities.\nFNCB\u2019s risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks or losses.\nFNCB\u2019s risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which FNCB is subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. FNCB\u2019s framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. FNCB\u2019s risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to FNCB. If FNCB\u2019s risk management framework is not effective, FNCB could suffer unexpected losses and its business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. FNCB may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nFNCB is subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect its profitability.\nFNCB\u2019s profitability, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent on its net interest income, which is the difference between its interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and its interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond FNCB\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest FNCB receives on loans and securities and the interest FNCB pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could affect FNCB\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of FNCB\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of FNCB\u2019s assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, FNCB\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB uses simulation analysis to model net interest income for various interest rate scenarios over a five-year time horizon. Based on the simulation analysis, FNCB\u2019s interest sensitivity profile at December 31, 2021 was characterized by maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities that were well matched over the next six to nine months, moving to an asset sensitivity position by the end of the first year and in subsequent years of the model. These simulations are based on numerous assumptions, including but not limited to: the nature and timing of interest rate levels, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment of asset and liability cash flows, customer behavior in a rising rate environment and other factors. When short-term interest rates rise, the rate of interest FNCB pays on its interest-bearing liabilities may rise more quickly than the rate of interest that FNCB receives on its interest-earning assets, which may cause FNCB\u2019s net interest income to decrease.\nAdditionally, a shrinking yield premium between short-term and long-term market interest rates, a pattern usually indicative of investors' waning expectations of future growth and inflation, commonly referred to as a flattening of the yield curve, typically reduces FNCB\u2019s profit margin as FNCB borrows at shorter terms than the terms at which FNCB lends and invests.\nIn addition, an increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on FNCB\u2019s results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. These circumstances could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs, but also reduce collateral values and necessitate further increases to the allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce income, cash flows and asset values.\nFNCB\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond FNCB\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the FRB. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest FNCB receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect FNCB\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of FNCB\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of FNCB\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio.\nIf the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and investments, FNCB\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty relating to the expected phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may adversely affect FNCB.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority and the administrator of LIBOR have announced that the publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be published or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be published as of December 31, 2021. Given consumer protection, litigation, and reputation risks, the bank regulatory agencies have indicated that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would create safety and soundness risks and that they will examine bank practices accordingly. Therefore, the agencies encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. FNCB has discontinued originating LIBOR-based loans effective December 31, 2021, and will preferably negotiate loans using the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"Term SOFR\") going forward. As of December 31, 2021, FNCB had approximately $83.9 million of loans and $26.5 million in investments, as well as certain derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments that have attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR.\nThere continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate effects of the LIBOR transition, including with respect to the acceptance and use of Term SOFR and other benchmark rates, such as AMERIBOR, a benchmark developed by the American Financial Exchange and BSBY, a benchmark developed by Bloomberg Index Services, among others. Since Term SOFR and other benchmark rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR, which may lead to increased volatility as compared to LIBOR. The transition has impacted our market risk profiles and required changes to our risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with customers could adversely impact FNCB's reputation. Although FNCB is currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on FNCB's internal systems and processes, financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB may not be able to successfully compete with others for business.\nFNCB competes for loans, deposits and investment dollars with numerous regional and national banks and other community banking institutions, online divisions of banks located in other markets as well as other kinds of financial institutions and enterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage brokers, private lenders and Fintech companies. There is also competition for banking business from competitors outside of its market area. As noted above, FNCB and the Bank are subject to extensive regulations and supervision, including, in many cases, regulations that limit the type and scope of activities. Many competitors have substantially greater resources and may offer certain services that FNCB and the Bank does not provide, and operate under less stringent regulatory environments. The differences in available resources and applicable regulations may make it harder for FNCB to compete profitably, reduce the rates that it can earn on loans and investments, increase the rates it must offer on deposits and other funds, and adversely affect its overall financial condition and earnings. Refer to the section entitled \u201cBusiness - Competition\u201d included in Item 1, \"Business\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of FNCB's competitive environment.\nChanges in either FNCB\u2019s financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. The Board of Directors establishes liquidity policies, including contingency funding plans, and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity. FNCB\u2019s primary source of liquidity is customer deposits. The continued availability of this funding source depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and FNCB in particular. The availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g. changes in FDIC insurance, the liquidity coverage ratio, etc.), changes in the financial condition of FNCB, or the banking industry in general, and other events which can impact the perceived safety and soundness or economic benefits of bank deposits. While FNCB makes significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in FNCB\u2019s deposit funding through the use of liquidity stress testing, market related, geopolitical, or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits.\nFNCB may not be able to retain or grow its core deposit base, which could adversely impact its funding costs.\nLike many financial institutions, FNCB relies on customer deposits as its primary source of funding for its lending activities, and FNCB continues to seek customer deposits to maintain this funding base. FNCB\u2019s future growth will largely depend on its ability to retain and grow its deposit base. As of December 31, 2021, FNCB had $1.455 billion in deposits. FNCB\u2019s deposits are subject to potentially dramatic fluctuations in availability or price due to certain factors outside of its control, such as increasing competitive pressures for deposits, changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes, customer perceptions of its financial health and general reputation, and a loss of confidence by customers in FNCB or the banking sector generally, which could result in significant outflows of deposits within short periods of time or significant changes in pricing necessary to maintain current customer deposits or attract additional deposits. Any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations, which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB is a bank holding company and depends on dividends from its subsidiary, FNCB Bank, to operate.\nFNCB is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Bank conducts most of FNCB\u2019s operations and FNCB depends upon dividends from the Bank to service FNCB's debt, pay FNCB\u2019s expenses and to pay dividends to FNCB's shareholders. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank\u2019s regulators could limit the payment of dividends or other payments to FNCB by the Bank. In the event that the Bank was unable to pay dividends and would be unable to repurchase its shares, FNCB in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends to its shareholders. Failure to pay dividends to FNCB shareholders could have a material adverse effect on the market price of FNCB\u2019s Common Stock. For additional information regarding dividend restrictions, refer to the section entitled \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d included in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf FNCB loses access to wholesale funding sources, it may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of its depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.\nWholesale funding sources include brokered deposits, one-way CDARS and ICS deposits, federal funds lines of credit, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB of Pittsburgh, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with certain qualifying assets within the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio. In addition, FNCB\u2019s available-for-sale securities provide an additional source of liquidity. Disruptions in availability of wholesale funding can directly impact the liquidity of FNCB and the Bank. The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact FNCB\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital.\nFNCB held approximately $1.9 million in capital stock of the FHLB as of December 31, 2021. FNCB must own such capital stock to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system which enables it to borrow funds under the FHLB advance program. If the FHLB were to cease operations, FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nInterruptions or security breaches of FNCB\u2019s information systems could negatively affect its financial performance or reputation.\nIn conducting its business, FNCB relies heavily on its information systems. FNCB collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in its data centers and on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to FNCB\u2019s operations and business strategy. Maintaining and protecting those systems is difficult and expensive, as is dealing with any failure, interruption or breach of those systems. Despite security measures, FNCB\u2019s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any damage, failure or breach could cause an interruption in operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through FNCB\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or breaches could damage FNCB\u2019s reputation, disrupt operations and the services provided to customers, cause a loss of confidence in the products and the services provided, cause FNCB to incur additional expenses, result in a loss of customer business and data, result in legal claims or proceedings, result in liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, result in regulatory penalties, or expose FNCB to other liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and competitive position.\nFNCB depends on information technology and telecommunications systems of third parties, and any systems failures or interruptions could adversely affect FNCB\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nFNCB\u2019s business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information technology and telecommunications systems. FNCB outsources many of its major systems, such as data processing, deposit processing, loan origination, email and anti-money laundering monitoring systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt FNCB\u2019s operations, and FNCB could experience difficulty in implementing replacement solutions. In many cases, FNCB\u2019s operations rely heavily on secured processing, storage and transmission of information and the monitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could have significant consequences. Because FNCB\u2019s information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, FNCB could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise FNCB\u2019s ability to operate effectively, damage FNCB\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business and subject FNCB to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, failure of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt FNCB\u2019s operations or adversely affect FNCB\u2019s reputation.\nFNCB is subject to cybersecurity risks and security breaches and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents, and FNCB may experience harm to its reputation and liability exposure from security breaches.\nFNCB\u2019s business involves the storage and transmission of customers' proprietary information and security breaches could expose FNCB to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. While FNCB has not incurred a material cyber-attack or security breach to date, a number of other financial services and other companies have disclosed cyber-attacks and security breaches, some of which have involved intentional attacks. Attacks may be targeted at FNCB, its customers or both. Although FNCB devotes significant resources to maintain, regularly update and backup its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of FNCB\u2019s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to FNCB or its customers, its security measures may not be effective against all potential cyber-attacks or security breaches. Despite FNCB\u2019s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that FNCB may not be able to anticipate, or implement effective preventive measures against, all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as FNCB continues to increase FNCB\u2019s internet-based product offerings and expand its internal usage of web-based products and applications. If an actual or perceived security breach occurs, customer perception of the effectiveness of FNCB\u2019s security measures could be harmed and could result in the loss of customers.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of FNCB\u2019s systems, including those of third party providers or other financial institutions, or the failure to meet regulatory requirements for security of its systems, could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of FNCB\u2019s operations, misappropriation of FNCB\u2019s confidential information or that of FNCB\u2019s customers, or damage to FNCB\u2019s computers or systems or those of FNCB\u2019s customers or counterparties, significant increases in compliance costs (such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies), and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to FNCB or to its customers, loss of confidence in its security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation and regulatory exposure, and harm to FNCB\u2019s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf FNCB\u2019s information technology is unable to keep pace with growth or industry developments or if technological developments result in higher costs or less advantageous pricing, financial performance may suffer.\nEffective and competitive delivery of FNCB\u2019s products and services increasingly depends on information technology resources and processes, both those provided internally as well as those provided through third party vendors. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology can improve efficiency and help reduce costs. FNCB\u2019s future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience, as well as to create efficiencies in its operations. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. This can reduce net interest income and non-interest income from fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require FNCB to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services. FNCB may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology, or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. Many of FNCB\u2019s competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Additionally, as technology in the financial services industry changes and evolves, keeping pace becomes increasingly complex and expensive. There can be no assurance that FNCB will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, which could reduce its ability to compete effectively. As a result, FNCB could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract customers, or be subject to cost increases.\nFNCB relies on management and other key personnel and the loss of any of them may adversely affect its operations.\nFNCB believes each member of the executive management team is important to its success and the unexpected loss of any of these persons could impair day-to-day operations as well as its strategic direction.\nFNCB\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by FNCB can be intense and it may not be able to hire people or retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of FNCB\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on its business due to the loss of their skills, knowledge of its market, years of industry experience and to the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nFNCB is dependent on the use of data and modeling in both its management\u2019s decision-making generally and in meeting regulatory expectations in particular.\nThe use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitatively-based analyses is endemic to bank decision-making and regulatory compliance processes, and the employment of such analyses is becoming increasingly widespread in FNCB\u2019s operations. Liquidity stress testing, interest rate sensitivity analysis, allowance for loan loss measurement, portfolio stress testing and the identification of possible violations of anti-money laundering regulations are examples of areas in which FNCB is dependent on models and the data that underlies them. FNCB anticipates that model-derived insights will be used more widely in FNCB\u2019s decision-making in the future. While these quantitative techniques and approaches improve FNCB\u2019s decision-making, they also create the possibility that faulty data or flawed quantitative approaches could yield adverse outcomes or regulatory scrutiny. Secondarily, because of the complexity inherent in these approaches, misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could similarly result in suboptimal decision making, which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject FNCB to additional risk.\nFrom time to time, FNCB may implement new lines of business or offer new products and product enhancements as well as new services within FNCB\u2019s existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. In developing, implementing or marketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, FNCB may invest significant time and resources. FNCB may underestimate the appropriate level of resources or expertise necessary to make new lines of business or products successful to realize their expected benefits. FNCB may not achieve the milestones set in initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the ultimate implementation of a new line of business or offering of new products, product enhancements or services. Any new line of business, product, product enhancement or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of FNCB\u2019s system of internal controls. FNCB may also decide to discontinue business or products, due to lack of customer acceptance or unprofitability. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFNCB\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by FNCB or other institutions. These losses could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDamage to FNCB\u2019s reputation could significantly harm its businesses, competitive position and prospects for growth.\nFNCB\u2019s ability to attract and retain investors, customers, clients, and employees could be adversely affected by damage to its reputation resulting from various sources, including environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") related issues, employee misconduct, litigation, or regulatory outcomes; failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality; compliance failures; unethical behavior; unintended breach of confidential information; and the activities of FNCB\u2019s clients, customers, or counterparties. Actions by the financial services industry in general, or by certain entities or individuals within it, also could have a significantly adverse impact on FNCB\u2019s reputation.\nFNCB\u2019s actual or perceived failure to identify and address various issues, including failure to properly address operational and ESG risks, could also give rise to reputation risk that could negatively impact business prospects. These issues include, among others, legal and regulatory requirements; consumer protection, fair lending, and privacy issues; properly maintaining customer and associated personal information; record keeping; protecting against money laundering; sales and trading practices; and ethical issues.\nFNCB may be a defendant from time to time in a variety of litigation and other actions, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFNCB has been and may continue to be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation matters arising out of its business. An increased number of lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits and other consumer driven litigation, have been filed and will likely continue to be filed against financial institutions, which may involve substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages. Management believes the risk of litigation generally increases during downturns in the national and local economies. FNCB\u2019s insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against it, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm its reputation and may cause it to incur significant expense. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, FNCB may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may it be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all. Refer to Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of FNCB's current material legal matters.\nFNCB depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, FNCB may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial information. FNCB may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. In deciding whether to extend credit, FNCB may rely upon customers' representations that their financial statements conform to GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. FNCB also may rely on customer representations and certifications, or audit or accountants' reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of its customers. FNCB\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if FNCB relies on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nFNCB may face risks with respect to future expansion or acquisition activity.\nFNCB may selectively seek to expand its banking operations through limited de novo branching or opportunistic acquisition activities. FNCB cannot be certain that any expansion activity, through de novo branching, acquisition of branches of another financial institution or a whole institution, or the establishment or acquisition of nonbanking financial service companies, will prove profitable or will increase shareholder value. The success of any acquisition will depend, in part, on FNCB\u2019s ability to realize the estimated cost savings and revenue enhancements from combining its business and that of the target company. FNCB\u2019s ability to realize increases in revenue will depend, in part, on its ability to retain customers and employees, and to capitalize on existing relationships for the provision of additional products and services. If FNCB estimates turn out to be incorrect or FNCB is not able to successfully combine companies, the anticipated cost savings and increased revenues may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing business, diversion of management attention, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect FNCB\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. As with any combination of banking institutions, there also may be disruptions that cause FNCB to lose customers or cause customers to withdraw their deposits. Customers may not readily accept changes to their banking arrangements that FNCB makes as part of, or following, an acquisition. Additionally, the value of an acquisition to FNCB is dependent on its ability to successfully identify and estimate the magnitude of any asset quality issues of acquired companies.\nFNCB may not be successful in overcoming these risks or other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions or other expansion activity. FNCB\u2019s inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s ability to implement its business strategy and enhance shareholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if FNCB records goodwill in connection with any acquisition, FNCB\u2019s financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected if that goodwill is determined to be impaired, which would require FNCB to take an impairment charge.\nFNCB could be subject to environmental risks and associated costs on its foreclosed real estate assets.\nA substantial portion of FNCB\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, FNCB may foreclose on and take title to properties securing loans. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties and that FNCB could be liable for remediation costs, as well as personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require FNCB to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property's value or limit FNCB\u2019s ability to sell the affected property. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nAlthough U.S. and global economies have begun to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic as many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased, certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and may persist for some time, including labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains. The growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside labor shortages and supply chain complications, has also contributed to rising inflationary pressures. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact FNCB's business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the rate and distribution and administration of vaccines globally, the severity and duration of any resurgence of COVID-19 variants either locally, nationally or globally, the continued effectiveness of FNCB's business continuity plan, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on FNCB's customers, counterparties and service providers, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nGovernmental authorities have taken significant measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth. These measures may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic. Additionally, some measures, such as a suspension of consumer and commercial loan payments, may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. We also expect that the temporary reduction of interest rates to near zero will, over the course of 2022, be reversed, with the Federal Reserve now signaling its concerns with respect to inflation and announcing that it will begin to taper its purchases of mortgages and other bonds.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in heightened operational risks. A significant portion of FNCB's staff has been working remotely, and increased levels of remote access create additional cybersecurity risk and opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals have increased their attempts to compromise business emails, including an increase in phishing attempts, and fraudulent vendors or other parties may view the pandemic as an opportunity to prey upon consumers and businesses during this time. The increase in online and remote banking activities may also increase the risk of fraud in certain instances.\nThe length of the pandemic and the effectiveness of the measures being put in place to address it are unknown. Until the effects of the pandemic subside, there is a risk of reduced revenues in our businesses and increased customer defaults. Furthermore, the U.S. economy experienced a temporary recession as a result of the pandemic, and our business could be materially and adversely affected by another recession should the effects of the pandemic continue for a period of time or worsen. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects FNCB's business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations, it also has the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFNCB has also participated as a lender in certain government programs designed to provide economic relief in response to the pandemic, including the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") and the Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending Program. As a result of participating in these programs, FNCB faces increased risks, including credit, fraud risk and litigation. Additionally, while these loans to small business clients benefit from a government guaranty, many of these businesses may face difficulties even after being granted such a loan. Many of theses businesses have loans other than PPP loans with FNCB A decline in the financial condition of these businesses could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which could have an adverse impact on FNCB\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to FNCB\u2019s Industry\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine FNCB\u2019s business and may require FNCB to remediate adverse examination findings or may take enforcement action against FNCB.\nThe FRB, the FDIC and the PADOBS, periodically examine FNCB\u2019s business, including its compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, the Federal Reserve, FDIC or PADOBS were to determine that FNCB\u2019s financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of FNCB\u2019s operations had become unsatisfactory, or that FNCB were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to require FNCB to remediate any such adverse examination findings.\nIn addition, these agencies have the power to take enforcement action against FNCB to enjoin \"unsafe or unsound\" practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation of law or regulation or unsafe or unsound practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in FNCB\u2019s capital, to direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets, to limit dividends and distributions, including the repurchase of common stock, to restrict FNCB\u2019s growth, to assess civil money penalties against FNCB or its officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate FNCB\u2019s deposit insurance and place the Bank into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory enforcement action against FNCB could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB may be required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for the Bank in times of stress.\nFNCB, as a bank holding company, is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank if necessary. FNCB may be required to commit additional resources to the Bank at times when FNCB may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in FNCB\u2019s, or its shareholders\u2019 or creditors\u2019, best interests to do so. A requirement to provide such support is more likely during times of financial stress for FNCB and the Bank, which may make any capital FNCB is required to raise to provide such support more expensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans FNCB makes to the Bank are subordinate in right of repayment to deposit liabilities of the Bank.\nFNCB is subject to extensive government regulation, supervision and possible regulatory enforcement actions, which may subject it to higher costs and lower shareholder returns.\nThe banking industry is subject to extensive regulation and supervision that govern almost all aspects of its operations. The extensive regulatory framework is primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance fund and depositors, not shareholders. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and, in some instances, may put banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies, leasing companies and internet-based Fintech companies. FNCB\u2019s regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including with respect to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank or a bank holding company, the imposition of significant fines, the ability to delay or deny merger or other regulatory applications, the classification of assets by a bank, and the adequacy of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses, among other matters. If they deem FNCB to be operating in a manner inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices, these regulatory authorities can require the entry into informal and formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memorandum of understanding, settlement agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which FNCB would be required to implement identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and/or to refrain from taking certain actions in the form of injunctive relief. In recent years, the banking industry has faced increased regulation and scrutiny; for instance, areas such as BSA compliance (including BSA and related anti-money laundering regulations) and real estate-secured consumer lending (such as Truth-in-Lending regulations, changes in Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act regulations, implementation of licensing and registration requirements for mortgage originators and more recently, heightened regulatory attention to mortgage and foreclosure-related activities and exposures) are being confronted with escalating regulatory expectations and scrutiny. Non-compliance with laws and regulations such as these, even in cases of inadvertent non-compliance, could result in litigation, significant fines and/or sanctions. Any failure to comply with, or any change in, any applicable regulation and supervisory requirement, or change in regulation or enforcement by such authorities, whether in the form of policies, regulations, legislation, rules, orders, enforcement actions, or decisions, could have a material impact on FNCB, the Bank and other affiliates, and its operations. Federal economic and monetary policy may also affect FNCB\u2019s ability to attract deposits and other funding sources, make loans and investments, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads. Any failure to comply with such regulation or supervision could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, compliance with any such action could distract management\u2019s attention from FNCB\u2019s operations, cause it to incur significant expenses, restrict it from engaging in potentially profitable activities and limit its ability to raise capital.\nNew or changed legislation or regulation and regulatory initiatives could adversely affect FNCB through increased regulation and increased costs of doing business.\nChanges in federal and state legislation and regulation may affect FNCB\u2019s operations. Laws and regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, may have unforeseen or unintended consequences on the banking industry. The Dodd-Frank Act has implemented significant changes to the U.S. financial system, including the creation of new regulatory agencies (such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council to oversee systemic risk and the CFPB to develop and enforce rules for consumer financial products), changes in retail banking regulations, and changes to deposit insurance assessments. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act has implemented new requirements with respect to \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d and new mortgage servicing standards have, and may continue to, increase costs associated with this business. Refer to the section entitled \u201cBusiness - The Bank - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u201d included in Item 1, \"Business\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of new or changed legislation or regulation and regulatory initiatives.\nThe Biden Administration may seek to implement a regulatory reform agenda, which could include a heightened focus on the regulation of loan portfolios and credit concentrations to borrowers impacted by climate change, heightened scrutiny on Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements, topics related to social equity, executive compensation, and increased capital and liquidity, as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends. In addition, mergers and acquisitions could be dampened by increased antitrust scrutiny. Reform proposals are also expected for the short-term wholesale markets. At this time it cannot be determined which, if any of these policies, would be implemented and what their impact would be. However, FNCB believes such uncertainty may reduce business activities, which ordinarily would be beneficial to its business.\nAdditionally, final rules to implement Basel III adopted in July 2013 revise risk-based and leverage capital requirements and limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonuses if a banking organization does not hold the required \u201ccapital conservation buffer.\u201d The rule became effective for FNCB on January 1, 2015, with some additional transition periods. This additional regulation could increase compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect operations. Refer to the description in Item 1, \"Business\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading \u201cCapital Adequacy Requirements\u201d for a more detailed description of the final rules. The potential also exists for additional federal or state laws or regulations, or changes in policy or interpretations, affecting many of FNCB\u2019s operations, including capital levels, lending and funding practices, insurance assessments, and liquidity standards. The effect of any such changes and their interpretation and application by regulatory authorities cannot be predicted, may increase FNCB\u2019s cost of doing business and otherwise affect FNCB\u2019s operations, may significantly affect the markets in which it does business, and could have a materially adverse effect on FNCB.\nFNCB is also subject to the guidelines under the GLB Act. The GLB Act guidelines require, among other things, that each financial institution develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution\u2019s activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. In recent years there also has been increasing enforcement activity in the areas of privacy, information security and data protection in the United States, including at the federal level. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations regarding the privacy, security and protection of customer and employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs. In addition, non-compliance could result in potentially significant fines, penalties and damage to FNCB\u2019s reputation and brand.\nThe Federal Reserve may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing significant internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. FNCB\u2019s regulatory capital ratios currently are in excess of the levels established for \"well capitalized\" institutions. Future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards.\nAny new or revised standards adopted in the future may require us to maintain materially more capital, with common equity as a more predominant component, or manage the configuration of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements. We may not be able to raise additional capital at all, or on terms acceptable to us. Failure to maintain capital to meet current or future regulatory requirements could have a significant material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB faces a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA Patriot Act or Patriot Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. FNCB is required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. FNCB\u2019s federal and state banking regulators, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d), and other government agencies are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of anti-money laundering requirements. FNCB is also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the regulations issued and enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). If FNCB\u2019s program is deemed deficient, FNCB could be subject to liability, including fines, civil money penalties and other regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on FNCB\u2019s business operations and its ability to pay dividends, or repurchase shares of its common stock, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have significant consequences to FNCB's reputation. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFNCB is subject to numerous \"fair and responsible banking\" laws designed to protect consumers, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations, including state laws and regulations, prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. The Federal Trade Commission Act and the Dodd-Frank Act prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices by financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, federal banking agencies, and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these fair and responsible banking laws and regulations. A challenge to an institution\u2019s compliance with fair and responsible banking laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFNCB is subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage FNCB\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely affect FNCB\u2019s business.\nFNCB\u2019s business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d), in various information systems that FNCB maintains and in those maintained by third party service providers. FNCB also maintains important internal company data such as PII about its employees and information relating to its operations. FNCB is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of PII of individuals (including customers, employees and other third parties). For example, FNCB\u2019s business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or the GLB Act, which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on FNCB\u2019s ability to share nonpublic PII about FNCB\u2019s customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that FNCB provides certain disclosures to customers about its information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \"opt out\" of any information sharing by FNCB with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that FNCB develops, implements and maintains a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on FNCB\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of its activities, and the sensitivity of customer information FNCB processes, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various federal and state banking regulators and states have also enacted data breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that FNCB\u2019s collection, use, transfer and storage of PII complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase FNCB\u2019s costs. Furthermore, FNCB may not be able to ensure that customers and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with FNCB, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), FNCB could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of FNCB\u2019s measures to safeguard PII, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause FNCB to lose customers or potential customers and thereby reduce FNCB\u2019s revenues. Accordingly, any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject FNCB to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage FNCB\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely affect FNCB\u2019s operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nRulemaking changes implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may result in higher regulatory and compliance costs that may adversely affect FNCB\u2019s business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, which was granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the examination, supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations issued by the CFPB have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. These changes could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase.\nThe Bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, the Bank is subject to insurance assessments based on the Bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. The Bank\u2019s regular assessments are determined by its risk classification, which is based on its regulatory capital levels and the level of supervisory concern that it poses. Numerous bank failures during the financial crisis and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put significant pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund required by statute and FDIC estimates of projected requirements, the FDIC has the power to increase deposit insurance assessment rates and impose special assessments on all FDIC-insured financial institutions. Any future increases or special assessments could reduce FNCB\u2019s profitability and could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to FNCB\u2019s Common Stock\nThe price of FNCB\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of common stock at a time or price they find attractive.\nFNCB\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond its control. These factors include, among others:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in operating results and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to FNCB or other financial institutions;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to FNCB\u2019s reputation or the financial services industry;\n\u25cf\nfailure to declare dividends on FNCB\u2019s common stock from time to time;\n\u25cf\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u25cf\nfailure to integrate any future acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from any future acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by FNCB or its competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions or financings;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of FNCB\u2019s competitors or other companies that investors deem comparable to FNCB;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales or repurchases of FNCB\u2019s equity or equity-related securities;\n\u25cf\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u25cf\nanticipated or pending audits or litigation that involve or affect FNCB;\n\u25cf\nany future investigations or proceedings that involve or affect FNCB;\n\u25cf\nadverse weather conditions, including floods, tornadoes and hurricanes;\n\u25cf\ngeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to FNCB\u2019s performance; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect FNCB\u2019s stock price, notwithstanding its operating results. FNCB expects that the market price of its common stock will continue to fluctuate and there can be no assurances about the levels of the market prices for its common stock.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause FNCB\u2019s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nThe rights of holders of FNCB\u2019s common stock to receive liquidation payments and dividend payments are junior to FNCB\u2019s existing and future indebtedness and to any senior securities FNCB may issue in the future, and FNCB\u2019s ability to declare dividends on, or repurchase shares of, the common stock may become limited.\nShares of the common stock are equity interests in FNCB and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, shares of FNCB\u2019s common stock rank junior to all current and future indebtedness and other non-equity claims on FNCB with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on FNCB, including in a liquidation of FNCB. FNCB may, and the Bank and FNCB\u2019s other subsidiaries may also, incur additional indebtedness from time to time and may increase FNCB\u2019s aggregate level of outstanding indebtedness.\nFNCB\u2019s board of directors is authorized to cause FNCB to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of the shareholders. If FNCB issues preferred shares in the future that have a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, or if FNCB issues preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, then the rights of holders of FNCB\u2019s common stock or the market price of FNCB\u2019s common stock could be adversely affected.\nFNCB\u2019s ability to pay dividend, or repurchase shares of its common stock, may become limited by regulatory restrictions. In addition, the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to FNCB is limited by the Bank\u2019s obligations to maintain sufficient accumulated net earnings and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to state nonmember banks.\nHolders of FNCB\u2019s common stock are only entitled to receive the dividends that FNCB\u2019s board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for those payments. In addition, FNCB's board of directors may only repurchase shares out of funds legally available for those repurchases. Although FNCB has historically paid cash dividends on its common stock, and has recently announced a share repurchase program to repurchase shares of its common stock, FNCB is not required to do so. FNCB cannot assure shareholders that it will continue paying dividends, or repurchase shares, in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of FNCB\u2019s common stock. Also, as discussed above, FNCB is a bank holding company and its ability to declare and pay dividends, or repurchase shares, depends in part on federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends.\nFNCB may need to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed and on terms favorable to current shareholders.\nLaws, regulations and banking regulators require FNCB and the Bank to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations. In addition, capital levels are determined by FNCB\u2019s management and Board of Directors based on capital levels that they believe are necessary to support business operations. Management regularly evaluates its present and future capital requirements and needs and analyzes capital raising alternatives and options. Although FNCB succeeded in meeting its current regulatory capital requirements, it may need to raise additional capital in the future to support growth, possible loan losses or potential OTTI during future periods, to meet future regulatory capital requirements or for other reasons.\nThe Board of Directors may determine from time to time that FNCB needs to raise additional capital by issuing additional shares of common stock or other securities. FNCB is not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. Because FNCB\u2019s decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control, FNCB cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings may be affected. Such offerings will likely be dilutive to common shareholders from ownership, earnings and book value perspectives. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, its then current common shareholders. Additionally, if FNCB raises additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, upon liquidation, holders of its debt securities and shares of preferred shares, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, will receive distributions of available assets prior to the holders of common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders or reduce the market price of FNCB\u2019s common stock, or both. Holders of FNCB\u2019s common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.\nFNCB cannot provide any assurance that additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit access to the capital markets may adversely affect FNCB\u2019s capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. Moreover, if FNCB needs to raise capital, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on FNCB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn investment in FNCB\u2019s common stock is not an insured deposit.\nFNCB\u2019s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in FNCB\u2019s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, and elsewhere in FNCB\u2019s reports filed with the SEC, including under heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or any subsequent report filed by FNCB. Investment in FNCB\u2019s common stock is also subject to the market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, shareholders may lose some or all of their investment in FNCB\u2019s common stock.\nShareholders may not receive dividends on FNCB\u2019s common stock or have their shares repurchased by FNCB.\nAlthough FNCB has historically declared quarterly cash dividends on its common stock, and adopted a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of its common stock, FNCB is not required to do so and may reduce or cease to pay common stock dividends, or repurchase shares, in the future. If FNCB reduces or ceases to pay common stock dividends, or terminates its stock repurchase program, the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe principal source of funds from which FNCB pays cash dividends, and repurchase shares, are the dividends received from the Bank. Banking laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict the amount of dividends and loans a bank may make to its parent company. In addition, under The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, banks may not pay a dividend, or repurchase shares if, after paying the dividend, or repurchasing such shares, the bank would be undercapitalized.\nIf FNCB fails to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of its common stock may be the sole opportunity for gains on an investment in its common stock. In addition, in the event the Bank becomes unable to pay dividends to FNCB, FNCB may not be able to service its debt or pay its other obligations, pay dividends on, or repurchase shares of, its common stock and preferred stock. Accordingly, FNCB\u2019s inability to receive dividends from the Bank could also have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of a shareholder\u2019s investment in FNCB\u2019s common stock.\nAn entity holding as little as a 5% interest in FNCB\u2019s outstanding securities could, under certain circumstances, be subject to regulation as a \u201cbank holding company.\u201d\nAny entity, including a \u201cgroup\u201d composed of natural persons, owning or controlling with the power to vote 25% or more of FNCB\u2019s outstanding securities, or 5% or more if the holder otherwise exercises a \u201ccontrolling influence\u201d over FNCB, may be subject to regulation as a \u201cbank holding company\u201d in accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHC Act. In addition, (a) any bank holding company or foreign bank with a U.S. presence may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act to acquire or retain 5% or more of FNCB\u2019s outstanding securities and (b) any person not otherwise defined as a company by the BHC Act and its implementing regulations may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the Change in Bank Control Act to acquire or retain 10% or more of FNCB\u2019s outstanding securities. Becoming a bank holding company imposes statutory and regulatory restrictions and obligations, such as providing managerial and financial strength for its bank subsidiaries. Regulation as a bank holding company could require the holder to divest all or a portion of the holder\u2019s investment in FNCB\u2019s securities or those nonbanking investments that may be deemed impermissible or incompatible with bank holding company status, such as a material investment in a company unrelated to banking.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain FNCB\u2019s resources and divert management's attention.\nFNCB is a public company, subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and applicable securities rules and regulations. Under FDIC regulations, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and regulations increase the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices over those of non-public or non-reporting companies. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that FNCB file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to its business and operating results and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a Nasdaq listed company, FNCB is also required to prepare and file proxy materials which meet the requirements of the Exchange Act and the SEC's proxy rules. Compliance with these rules and regulations increase FNCB\u2019s legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increase demand on FNCB\u2019s systems and resources, particularly if FNCB becomes ineligible to report as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the SEC\u2019s regulations. In order to maintain, appropriately document and, if required, improve FNCB\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet the standards required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm FNCB\u2019s business and operating results. Additionally, any failure by FNCB to file its periodic reports with the SEC in a timely manner could, among other things, harm its reputation, cause its investors and potential investors to lose confidence in FNCB, restrict trading in or reduce the market price of FNCB\u2019s common stock, and potentially limit its ability to access the capital markets.\nAs a public company, FNCB incurs significant legal, accounting, insurance, compliance and other expenses. Any deficiencies in FNCB\u2019s financial reporting or internal controls could materially and adversely affect its business and the market price of FNCB\u2019s common stock.\nAs a public company, FNCB incurs significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses. These costs and compliance with the rules of the SEC and the rules of Nasdaq increase FNCB\u2019s legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. SEC rules require that FNCB\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer periodically certify the existence and effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. In addition, FNCB is required to engage an independent registered public accounting firm to audit and opine on the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. This process requires significant documentation of policies, procedures and systems, and review of that documentation and testing of FNCB\u2019s internal control over financial reporting by its internal auditing and accounting staff and an independent registered public accounting firm. This process requires considerable time and attention from management, which could prevent FNCB from successfully implementing its business initiatives and improving its business, financial condition and results of operations, which may strain FNCB\u2019s internal resources, and may increase its operating costs. FNCB may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses and outside auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter.\nDuring the course of FNCB\u2019s testing it may identify deficiencies that would have to be remediated to satisfy the SEC rules for certification of FNCB\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined by the standards issued by the PCAOB as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of FNCB\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a consequence, FNCB would have to disclose in periodic reports it files with the SEC any material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. The existence of a material weakness would preclude management from concluding that FNCB\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective and would preclude its independent auditors from expressing an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. In addition, disclosures of deficiencies of this type in FNCB\u2019s SEC reports could cause investors to lose confidence in its financial reporting, and may negatively affect the market price of its common stock, and could result in the delisting of its securities from the securities exchanges on which they trade. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud. If FNCB has deficiencies in its disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, it may materially and adversely affect FNCB.\nFNCB\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting may not achieve their intended objectives.\nFNCB maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure the timely filing of reports as specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. FNCB also maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting. These controls may not achieve their intended objectives. Control processes that involve human diligence and compliance, such as its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, are subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Controls can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there are risks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected and that information may not be reported on a timely basis. If FNCB\u2019s controls are not effective, it could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, and market for its common stock, and could subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nFrom time to time there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of financial statements. These changes can materially impact how FNCB records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some instances, FNCB could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nChanges which have been approved for future implementation include the calculation of the allowance for loan and leases losses on the basis of the current expected credit losses over the lifetime of our loans, referred to as the CECL model, which is expected to be applicable to us beginning in 2023. The change in this calculation could adversely affect our capital, regulatory capital ratios, ability to make larger loans, earnings and performance metrics. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the CECL model, banks will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \"incurred loss\" model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses, and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of the allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase the level of the allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are evaluating the impact the CECL accounting model will have on our accounting, but expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. We cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in FNCB\u2019s charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of FNCB\u2019s company and diminish the value of FNCB\u2019s common stock.\nSome of the provisions of FNCB\u2019s amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, could make it difficult for its shareholders to change the composition of its board of directors, preventing them from changing the composition of management. In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that FNCB\u2019s shareholders may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\nclassifying FNCB\u2019s board of directors into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u25cf\nauthorizing FNCB\u2019s board of directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u25cf\nrequiring the approval of 75% of FNCB\u2019s shareholders to approve any merger or sale of all, or substantially all, unless approval of such proposed transaction is recommended by at least a majority of FNCB\u2019s entire board of directors;\n\u25cf\nauthorizing FNCB\u2019s board of directors to, if it deems advisable, oppose a tender or other offer for FNCB\u2019s securities; and\n\u25cf\nrequiring the approval of 75% of FNCB\u2019s shareholders to amend certain provisions relating to business combinations not approved by the board of directors.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the \u201cPBCL\u201d), in the case of a merger or share exchange, with some exceptions, FNCB\u2019s board of directors must submit the plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders for approval, and the approval of the plan of merger or share exchange generally requires the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the plan exists.\nProvisions of the PBCL, applicable to FNCB provide, among other things, that:\n\u25cf\nFNCB may not engage in a business combination with an \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d generally defined as a holder of 20% of a corporation\u2019s voting stock, during the five-year period after the interested shareholder became such except under certain specified circumstances;\n\u25cf\nholders of FNCB\u2019s common stock may object to a \u201ccontrol transaction\u201d involving FNCB (a control transaction is defined as the acquisition by a person or group of persons acting in concert of at least 20% of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation), and demand that they be paid a cash payment for the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares from the \u201ccontrolling person or group\u201d;\n\u25cf\nholders of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d will not be entitled to voting rights with respect to any shares in excess of specified thresholds, including 20% voting control, until the voting rights associated with such shares are restored by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested shares and the outstanding voting shares of the Company; and\n\u25cf\nany \u201cprofit,\u201d as defined in the PBCL, realized by any person or group who is or was a \u201ccontrolling person or group\u201d with respect to FNCB from the disposition of any equity securities of within 18 months after the person or group became a \u201ccontrolling person or group\u201d shall belong to and be recoverable by FNCB.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could impede the ability of FNCB\u2019s common shareholders to benefit from a change of control and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of FNCB\u2019s common stock and shareholders\u2019 ability to realize any potential change-in-control premium.\nShort sellers of FNCB\u2019s stock may be manipulative and may drive down the market price of FNCB\u2019s common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller's interest for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, its business practices and prospects and similar matters calculated to or which may create negative market momentum, which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short. Issuers whose securities have historically had limited trading volumes or have been susceptible to relatively high volatility levels can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. The publication of any such commentary regarding FNCB in the future may bring about a temporary, or possibly long-term, decline in the market price of FNCB\u2019s common stock. No assurances can be made that declines in the market price of FNCB\u2019s common stock will not occur in the future, in connection with such commentary by short sellers or otherwise. When the market price of a company's stock drops significantly, it is not unusual for stockholder lawsuits to be filed or threatened against the company and its board of directors and for a company to suffer reputational damage. Such lawsuits could cause FNCB to incur substantial costs and divert the time and attention of FNCB\u2019s board and management. In addition, reputational damage may affect FNCB\u2019s ability to attract and retain deposits and may cause FNCB\u2019s deposit costs to increase, which could adversely affect its liquidity and earnings. Reputational damage may also affect FNCB\u2019s ability to attract and retain loan customers and maintain and develop other business relationships, which could likewise adversely affect FNCB\u2019s earnings. Negative reports issued by short sellers could also negatively impact FNCB\u2019s ability to attract and retain employees.", "PERMNO": 17359, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FNCB"}
