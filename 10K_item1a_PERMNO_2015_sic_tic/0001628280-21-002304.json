{"cik": "1289790", "company": "Macquarie Infrastructure Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our shares involves risks. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition and could cause a corresponding decline in the market price of our shares.\nStrategic and Economic Risks\nCOVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures, and the trading value of our securities.\nCOVID-19 has negatively affected the global economy, disrupted financial markets, disrupted supply chains, significantly reduced travel, and interrupted business activity. Federal, state, and local governments have implemented mitigation measures including travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, social distancing, shelter-in-place restrictions, and various limitations on business operations. Although the Company\u2019s businesses are considered essential services, these government actions have adversely affected the ability of our employees, customers, suppliers, and other business partners to conduct business activities, and could do so for an extended period of time. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures, and the trading value of our securities. Risks include:\n\u2022Impact on demand for our services and supply chain disruption. Restrictions on travel, public gatherings, and stay-at-home orders have reduced jet fuel sales and the demand for ancillary services provided by Atlantic Aviation. Tourism in Hawaii has declined, resulting in the full or partial closure of hotels and restaurants, which has reduced the consumption of gas provided by Hawaii Gas. We cannot predict whether the pandemic will permanently change our customers' behavior or whether such changes could materially impact our businesses. In addition, disruptions in the supply chain driven by the pandemic could result in delay or an inability to obtain products, supplies, and services needed in our operations.\n\u2022Impact on employees and on cybersecurity. Many of our management and office personnel are working remotely, and many employees at our facilities are working reduced hours, are on furlough and/or are abiding by social distancing procedures. In addition, our operations may be negatively affected by employee illness and/or quarantines. Further, our management teams have been required to devote large amounts of time and resources to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, thereby diverting attention from other priorities. In addition, the large scale remote working environment increases the risks posed by information technology systems breaches.\n\u2022Impact on liquidity and financial metrics. The ongoing effect of the pandemic on our businesses could affect our liquidity position, our cost of and ability to access funds from financial institutions and the capital markets, and could cause a deterioration in our financial metrics or the business environment that would negatively affected our credit ratings and could make it more difficult to meet the financial covenants in our credit facilities.\n\u2022Impact on capital expenditures and costs. We have deferred and may defer certain non-essential capital expenditures, including certain growth capital expenditures. If we are unable to deploy growth capital as planned, our long-term development prospects and ability to meet competitive challenges could be compromised. We are also incurring additional costs associated with the Company\u2019s pandemic response measures.\n\u2022Impact on our customers' ability to pay. The pandemic's impact on the financial condition and operating results of our customers may result in delayed payments and uncollectible accounts receivable, and could also result in the bankruptcy, insolvency, or cessation of the business of certain of our customers.\n\u2022Impact on trading and asset value. COVID-19 has resulted in volatile equity markets and meaningfully lower stock prices for many companies, including ours, and may do so in the future. In addition, the ongoing impact of the pandemic on our businesses could cause an impairment to goodwill or long-lived assets of the Company.\n\u2022Impact on our pursuit of strategic alternatives. In October 2019, we announced that we were pursuing strategic alternatives, which could result in, among other things, a sale of one or more of our businesses or potentially of the Company. COVID-19 has adversely affected economies and financial markets worldwide, impacted our stock price, affected the availability of financing, restricted travel and business activity, and adversely impacted the businesses of parties that may be interested in engaging in a strategic transaction. These effects have slowed our process of pursuing strategic alternatives, and may make it more difficult for us to complete any transactions at favorable valuations or at all.\nThe effects of COVID-19 on our businesses may continue for an extended period, and the ultimate impact on the Company of the pandemic will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including, without limitation, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the duration of governmental mitigation measures, the effectiveness of the\nactions taken to contain and treat the disease, and the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume. The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for material effects on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity increases the longer the pandemic impacts activity levels in the U.S. and globally.\nWe may not be successful in identifying or completing any strategic alternative or, if we are successful, any such strategic alternative may not unlock additional value for stockholders.\nIn October 2019, we announced that we were pursuing strategic alternatives that could result in, among other things, a sale of one or more of our businesses or potentially of the Company. Although we have successfully sold one of our businesses, our pursuit of strategic alternatives may not result in the identification or consummation of any additional transaction(s) or may not yield additional value for our stockholders. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives. The process of pursuing strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations, and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Any potential transactions, and the related valuations, would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among others, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our businesses, and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nIf we cannot or elect not to pursue a sale of the Company or our operating businesses, our strategy as an ongoing business requires significant growth capital expenditures and a failure to make such capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nIf we cannot or elect not to pursue sales of our businesses or of the Company, the growth of our businesses will continue to depend on the prudent deployment of capital and the acquisition of additional businesses. Our ability to deploy capital depends on a number of variables including: (i) commodity prices; (ii) customer demand; (iii) competitive and economic conditions; (iv) availability of suitable land on which to operate; (v) ability to obtain required regulatory approvals; and (vi) availability of capital. Our sources of growth capital include capital retained by our businesses, debt or equity issuances, and/or proceeds from the sales of businesses or assets. We may not generate sufficient cash or be able to arrange additional financing to fund our future growth needs on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to arrange financing, if needed, will depend on, among other factors, our credit ratings, leverage, financial and operating performance, general economic, financial, and regulatory conditions, and prevailing capital market conditions. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we incur significant additional indebtedness, or if we do not continue to generate sufficient cash from our operations, our credit ratings could be adversely affected, which would likely increase our future borrowing costs and could affect our ability to access additional capital. If we fail to deploy growth capital as planned, we may be unable to, among other things, expand our businesses to meet competitive challenges; take advantage of strategic acquisition and development opportunities; upgrade our facilities and systems; and create stockholder value. Any or all of these could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. In addition, under current law, certain capital expenditures are eligible for accelerated depreciation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we fail to take advantage of this accelerated depreciation when prudent to do so, our tax position could be materially adversely impacted.\nFluctuations in economic, equity, and credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our liquidity, or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms.\nShould economic, equity, and credit market conditions, collectively or individually, become disrupted, our ability to raise equity or obtain capital, to repay or refinance credit facilities at maturity, make significant capital expenditures, to pay, maintain or increase our dividend or fund growth may be costly and/or impaired. Our access to debt financing in particular will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit history and credit capacity, as well as the historical performance of our businesses and lender perceptions of their and our financial prospects. If we are unable to obtain debt financing, particularly as significant credit facilities mature, our internal sources of liquidity may not be sufficient.\nEconomic conditions may also increase our counterparty risk, particularly in those businesses whose revenues are determined under multi-year contracts. Should conditions deteriorate, we would expect to see increases in counterparty defaults and/or bankruptcies, which could result in an increase in bad debt expense and may cause our operating results to decline.\nVolatility in the financial markets may make projections regarding future obligations under pension plans difficult. Hawaii Gas, maintains defined benefit retirement plans. Future funding obligations under those plans depend in large part on the future performance of plan assets and the mix of investment. These defined benefit plans hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. If the market values of these securities decline or if interest rates decline, our pension expense and cash funding requirements would increase and, as a result, could materially adversely affect the results and liquidity of the business and our Company.\nA tight labor market could increase the cost of operating any of our businesses or make it more difficult to recruit and retain those with appropriate skillsets. In a tight labor market, it may take longer to identify and hire additional employees and such delays could, in turn, increase fees paid to recruiting firms or the amount of overtime paid to existing employees. A tight labor market may also drive the cost of retaining employees with appropriate skillsets higher to the extent we face increased competition from employers willing or able to pay higher wages.\nThe documents governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions.\nOur businesses' debt agreements may impose operational and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions could limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022cause operating companies to make distributions to the holding company, redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022make certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022grant or permit certain liens on our assets;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022merge, consolidate, or transfer substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022transfer or sell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries.\nThese covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, engage in business activities, including future opportunities that may be in our interest, and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness and cross-defaults with our other indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness. There is no guarantee that we would be able to satisfy our obligations if any of our indebtedness is accelerated.\nIf borrowing costs increase or if debt terms become more restrictive, the cost of refinancing and servicing our debt will increase, reducing our profitability, and ability to freely deploy capital or pay dividends to stockholders. We and any of our existing or future subsidiaries may incur substantially more indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks to our business as described herein.\nMost of our indebtedness matures within four to seven years. Refinancing this debt may result in substantially higher interest rates or credit margins or substantially more restrictive covenants. Any of these could limit our operational flexibility, limit or reduce our ability to pay dividends, and/or reduce distributions from our operating businesses to us. We cannot provide assurance that we will be willing or able to make capital contributions to repay the debt if required.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our pursuit of strategic alternatives or elect to continue invest in and grow our businesses, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness. If new debt is added to our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could be exacerbated.\nThe interest rates under our credit facilities may be adjusted for the phase-out of LIBOR.\nLIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans globally. We generally use LIBOR as a reference rate to calculate interest rates under our credit facilities. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), calculated using short-term repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities. SOFR may be more volatile than LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our credit agreements to replace LIBOR, and the interest rates under certain of our credit agreements may change. The new rates may not be as favorable to us as those currently in effect. We may also find it desirable to engage in more frequent interest rate hedging transactions.\nOur holding company level debt could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, limit our operational and financing flexibility, and negatively impact our business. As a holding company, we are dependent on the ability of our businesses to make distributions to us to pay our expenses, pay dividends, and repay indebtedness.\nOn December 31, 2020, we had $403 million of convertible senior notes outstanding. Although we retained a portion of the proceeds from the IMTT Transaction to repay the convertible notes, given the notes are non-callable until their maturity in 2023, we cannot provide assurance that all or any of the notes will be repaid using the retained cash. These holding company level debt instruments increase our interest payments and could have adverse effects on our business, including:\n\u2022requiring us to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest on the indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for dividends to stockholders, additional acquisitions, pursuit of business opportunities, or other business purposes;\n\u2022impairing our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under our contractual and commercial commitments;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with firms that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our businesses.\nWe expect to obtain the funds to pay our operating expenses and pay dividends, if any, primarily from our operating businesses. Our ability to meet our expenses and pay dividends therefore depends on the future performance of our businesses, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our businesses may not generate enough cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in our inability to repay indebtedness, to pay, maintain, or grow our dividend or to fund other liquidity needs. As a holding company with no operations, we are dependent on the ability of our businesses to make distributions to us to pay our expenses, pay dividends, and repay our indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nDevelopment and investment in our businesses involve various construction, operational, and regulatory risks that could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nThe development, construction, operation, and maintenance of our businesses involve various risks including, mechanical and structural failure, accidents, labor issues, or the failure of technology to perform as anticipated. Events outside our control, such as economic developments, changes in fuel prices or the price of other feedstocks, or governmental policy changes, could materially reduce the revenues generated or increase the expenses of constructing, operating or maintaining our businesses. Degradation of the performance of our facilities may reduce our revenues. Unanticipated capital expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading, or repairing our facilities may reduce our profitability. We may also choose or be required to decommission a project or other asset. The decommissioning process could be protracted and result in significant financial and/or regulatory obligations or other uncertainties.\nOur businesses may also face construction risks typical for infrastructure businesses, including, without limitation:\n\u2022labor disputes, work stoppages, or shortages of skilled labor;\n\u2022shortages of fuels or materials;\n\u2022slower than projected construction progress and the unavailability or late delivery of necessary equipment;\n\u2022delays caused by or in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or permits;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions and unexpected construction conditions;\n\u2022accidents or the breakdown or failure of construction equipment or processes;\n\u2022difficulties in obtaining suitable or adequate financing; and\n\u2022catastrophic or force majeure events such as explosions, fires and terrorist activities, and other similar events beyond our control.\nSuch developments could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of construction activities once undertaken. Construction costs may exceed estimates for various reasons, including inaccurate engineering and planning, higher than anticipated labor and building material costs, and unanticipated problems with project start-up. Such unexpected increases may result in increased debt service costs and/or funds being insufficient to complete construction. Our facilities under development may generate little or no cash flow through the date of\ncompletion of development and may experience operating deficits after the date of completion. In addition, market conditions may change during construction and make such development less attractive than at the time it was commenced. Any events of this nature could severely delay or prevent the completion of, or significantly increase the cost of, the construction. In addition, there are risks inherent in the construction work which may give rise to claims or demands against us from time to time. Delays in the completion of any project may result in lost revenues or increased expenses.\nChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs, result in fewer growth capital opportunities or projects, limit the amount of raw materials and products that we can import, decrease demand for certain of our services, or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nThe imposition of tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States has triggered retaliatory actions from certain foreign governments potentially resulting in a \u201ctrade war\u201d. A \u201ctrade war\u201d or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies could increase our costs, reduce the demand or opportunity to deploy growth capital in our businesses at attractive rates of return, limit the amount of raw materials, components and other products that we can import, restrict our customers\u2019 ability to deploy growth capital or transport products and therefore decrease demand for certain of our services, and/or adversely affect the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely impact our businesses.\nWarranties provided by our suppliers and contractors may be limited or insufficient to compensate our losses or may not cover the nature of our losses incurred.\nWe expect to benefit from various warranties, including product quality and performance warranties, provided by our suppliers and contractors. These suppliers and contractors, however, may file for bankruptcy, cease operations, or otherwise become unable or unwilling to fulfill their warranty obligations. Even if a supplier fulfills its warranty obligations, the warranty may not be enough to compensate us for our losses. In addition, the warranty period generally expires several years after the date that the equipment is delivered or commissioned and is subject to liability limits. Where damages are caused by defective products provided by our suppliers or construction services delivered by our contractors, our suppliers or contractors may be unable or unwilling to perform their warranty obligations as a result of their financial condition or otherwise, or if the warranty period has expired or a liability limit has been reached, there may be a reduction or loss of warranty protection for the affected projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our business\u2019 result of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel, or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees, could have an adverse effect on our consolidated businesses, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWe operate our consolidated businesses on a stand-alone basis, relying on existing management teams for day-to-day operations. Consequently, our operational success, as well as the success of our pursuit of strategic alternatives, will depend on the continued efforts of the management teams of our consolidating businesses, who have extensive experience in the day-to-day operations of these businesses. Furthermore, we will likely be dependent on the operating management teams of any businesses that we acquire in the future. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nProlonged work stoppages by employees who are subject to a collective bargaining agreement could adversely affect our financial position.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 17% of our businesses\u2019 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements have staggered expirations over the next several years. Although we believe our employee relations to be generally good, a prolonged work stoppage, strike or other slowdown at any facility with organized labor could significantly disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. In addition, we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us. Any renegotiation of labor agreements could significantly increase our costs for wages, healthcare, and other benefits.\nOur businesses are subject to environmental risks that may impact our future profitability.\nOur businesses are subject to numerous statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection and are exposed to various environmental risk and hazards.\n\u2022Atlantic Aviation is subject to risks and hazards as well as the environmental protection requirements related to the storage and handling of jet fuel and compliance with firefighting regulations.\n\u2022Hawaii Gas is subject to risks and hazards associated with the refining, storage, and handling of combustible products.\nMaterialization of these risks could result in substantial losses including personal injury, loss of life, damage or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage. Any losses we face could be greater than insurance levels maintained by our businesses and could have an adverse effect on their and our financial results. We also could be subject to fines and penalties for violation of applicable environmental regulations, which could be substantial. In addition, disruptions to physical assets could reduce our ability to serve customers and adversely affect future sales and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with regulations or other claims may interrupt operations and result in civil or criminal penalties, significant unexpected compliance costs and liabilities that could adversely affect the profitability of any operating business and the distributions it makes to us. These rules and regulations are subject to change and compliance with any changes could result in a restriction of the activities of our businesses, significant capital expenditures, and/or increased ongoing operating costs.\nOur businesses own or lease properties that have been subject to environmental contamination in the past and could require remediation for which our businesses are or may be liable. The remediation could cost more than anticipated or could be incurred earlier than anticipated, or both. In addition, the businesses may discover additional environmental contamination that may require remediation at significant cost. Further, the past contamination of the properties, including by former owners or operators of such properties, could result in remediation obligations, personal injury, property damage, environmental damage, or similar claims by third parties.\nWe may also be required to address other prior or future environmental contamination, including soil and groundwater contamination that results from the spillage of fuel, hazardous materials, or other pollutants. Under various federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for noncompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety requirements and for the costs of investigation, monitoring, removal or remediation of hazardous materials. These laws often impose liability, whether the current owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of those materials at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person and whether or not the original disposal or treatment activity accorded with all regulatory requirements. The presence of hazardous materials on a property could result in personal injury, loss of life, damage or destruction of property and equipment, environmental damage and/or claims by third parties that could have a material adverse effect on our result of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nUnfavorable publicity or public perception of the industries in which we operate could adversely impact our operating results and our reputation.\nAccidents and incidents involving the aviation industry, particularly those involving the airports and heliport at which we operate, whether or not directly related to our Company\u2019s services, and any media coverage thereof, can adversely impact our Company\u2019s reputation and the demand for our services. Similarly, negative publicity, public, or investor perception of the energy-related industries in which we operate, including through media coverage of environmental contamination and climate change concerns, could reduce demand for our services and harm our reputation. Any reduction in demand for the services our businesses provide or damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our share price, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and business prospects.\nFluctuations in commodity prices could adversely impact revenue, cost of services/goods sold, and gross margin at our businesses.\nRevenue at our Atlantic Aviation and Hawaii Gas businesses is generated primarily from the re-sale of a commodity. Accordingly, we may not be able to pass through all or any of the fluctuations in prices to customers.\nEnergy efficiency and technology advances, as well as conservation efforts and changes in the sources and types of energy produced in the U.S. may result in reduced demand for our products and services.\nConservation and technological advances including installation of improved insulation, the development of more efficient heating and cooling devices and advances in energy generation technology, may reduce demand for certain of our products and services. During periods of high energy commodity costs, the prices of certain of our products and services generally increase, which may also lead to increased conservation. In addition, federal and/or state regulation may require mandatory conservation measures, which could also reduce demand.\nThe discovery and development of new and unconventional energy sources in the U.S. may drive changes in related energy product logistics chains. The location and exploitation of these new energy sources could result in the dislocation of certain portions of some of our businesses. Changes in energy supply chain logistics or trends toward increased conservation could reduce demand for our products and services and could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nEach of our businesses experience a measure of seasonality and such seasonality may cause fluctuations in our results of operations.\nAlthough our businesses tend to produce stable financial results, each operates in an environment which can experience seasonal variations in results. Our aviation services business may generate relatively better financial results during cold weather months based on increased GA traffic into bases in Florida and the intermountain West. Our gas production and distribution business may generate incrementally more cash during the peak tourism periods in Hawaii between mid-December and the end of March and from mid-June through mid-September. To the extent that our businesses collectively appear to generate more cash flows in the first quarter of the year, such performance, if annualized, could result in an overly optimistic estimate of the value of our shares.\nSecurity breaches or interruptions in our information systems, the loss or misappropriation of confidential information, or cyber-attacks on our facilities or those of third parties on which we rely, could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information used to operate our businesses, make operational decisions, and manage inventory. We also share certain information technology networks with our Manager, and we use third-party information technology service providers. The information technology we use, as well as the information technology systems used by our Manager and third-party providers, could be vulnerable to security breach, damage or interruption from computer viruses, cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, natural disasters, or telecommunications failures. If our technology systems, or those of our Manager or third-party providers, were to fail or be breached and we were unable to restore them in a timely manner, we may be unable to maintain critical business functions and/or confidential data could be compromised, we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs and/or our reputation could be damaged. The occurrence of any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nWe transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks and rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission and storage of confidential information, such as customer credit card information. Any material failure by us to achieve or maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry security requirements or to rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment. Any loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, customers\u2019, employees\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a negative impact on our reputation, could result in loss of customers, could lead to regulatory enforcement actions against us, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nIf our information technology systems, or the information technology systems of third parties on which we rely, cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations including: (i) unauthorized access to our facilities or a cyber-attack on our automated systems, or the power grids or communications networks we use, that could cause operational disruption and potential environmental hazards; (ii) a cyber-attack on third-party transportation systems that could result in supply chain disruptions, or prevent our Hawaii Gas business from transporting product to its customers; and (iii) a cyber-attack on power generation facilities or refineries that could significantly impact prices and demand in the commodities markets. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, certain cyber incidents may remain undetected for an extended period. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe may face greater exposure to terrorism than other companies because of the nature of our businesses.\nOur businesses may face greater risk of terrorist attack than other businesses, particularly our operations within the immediate vicinity of metropolitan and suburban areas. Because our businesses provide basic or essential services relied on by many people, our facilities may be at greater risk for terrorism attacks than other businesses, which could affect our operations significantly. Any terrorist attacks that occur at or near our business locations would be likely to cause significant harm to our employees and assets. In recent years, insurers have significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war, or similar events. A terrorist attack that makes use of our property, or property under our control, may result in liability far in excess of available insurance coverage. In addition, any terrorist attack, regardless of location, could cause a disruption to our business and a decline in earnings. Furthermore, such an attack would likely result in an increase in insurance premiums and a reduction in coverage and could reduce profitability.\nSince completing the IMTT Transaction, we may be more susceptible to adverse events.\nSince completing the IMTT Transaction, we are subject to concentration of risks that affect our remaining operating businesses. We have fewer assets and may experience decreases in earnings and cash flow and increases in operating costs or other expenses. The market price of our common stock may decrease, and our common stock may be more susceptible to market fluctuations.\nRegulatory and Governmental Risks\nOur income may be adversely affected if additional compliance costs are required as a result of new safety, health, and/or environmental regulation.\nOur businesses are subject to federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect many aspects of their operations and are modified frequently. There is a risk that any one of our businesses may not be able to comply with some aspect of these laws and regulations, resulting in fines or penalties. Additionally, if new laws and regulations are adopted or if interpretations of existing laws and regulations change, we could be required to increase capital spending and/or incur increased operating expenses to comply. Because the regulatory environment changes frequently, we cannot predict when or how we may be affected by such changes. Emissions and other compliance testing technologies continue to improve, which may result in more stringent, targeted environmental regulations, and compliance obligations in the future, the costs of which could be material and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur businesses are dependent on our relationships, on a contractual and regulatory level, with government entities that may have significant leverage over us. Government entities may be influenced by political considerations to take actions adverse to us.\nOur businesses generally are, and will continue to be, subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies. In addition, our businesses rely on obtaining and maintaining government permits, licenses, concessions, leases, or contracts. Government entities, due to the wide-ranging scope of their authority, have significant leverage over us in their contractual and regulatory relationships with us that they may exercise in a manner that causes delays in the operation of our businesses or pursuit of our strategy, or increased administrative expense. Furthermore, government permits, licenses, concessions, leases, and contracts are generally very complex, and may result in periods of non-compliance, or disputes over interpretation or enforceability. If we fail to comply with these regulations or contractual obligations, we could be subject to financial penalties or we may lose our rights to operate the affected business, or both. Where our ability to operate a business is subject to a concession or lease from government entities, the concession or lease may restrict our ability to operate the business in a way that maximizes cash flows and profitability. Further, our ability to grow our current and future businesses will often require consent of numerous government regulators. Increased regulation restricting the ownership or management of U.S. assets by non-U.S. persons, given the non-U.S. ultimate ownership of our Manager, may limit our ability to pursue acquisitions. Any such regulation may also limit our Manager\u2019s ability to continue to manage our operations, which could cause disruption to our businesses and a decline in our performance. In addition, any required government consents may be costly to seek and we may not be able to obtain them. Failure to obtain any required consents could limit our ability to achieve our growth strategy.\nOur contracts with government entities may also contain clauses more favorable to the government counterparty than a typical commercial contract. For instance, a lease, concession, or general service contract may enable the government to terminate the agreement without adequate compensation. In addition, government counterparties also may have the discretion to change or increase regulation of our operations, or implement laws or regulations affecting our operations, separate from any contractual rights they may have. Governments have considerable discretion in implementing regulations that could impact these businesses. Governments may be influenced by political considerations to take actions that may hinder the efficient and profitable operation of our businesses.\nMany of our contracts, especially those with government entities or quasi-governmental entities are long-term contracts. These long-term contracts may be difficult to replace if terminated. In addition, buy-out or other early termination provisions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if exercised before the end of the contract.\nGovernment agencies may determine the prices we charge and may be able to restrict our ability to operate our businesses to maximize profitability.\nWhere our businesses are the sole or predominant service providers in their respective service areas and provide services that are essential to the community, they are likely to be subject to rate regulation. We may also face fees or other charges over which we have no control that increase our costs. We may be subject to increases in fees or unfavorable price determinations that may be final with no right of appeal or that, despite a right of appeal, could result in our profits being negatively affected. In addition, we may have very little negotiating leverage in establishing contracts with government entities, which may decrease\nthe prices that we otherwise might be able to charge or the terms upon which we provide products or services. Businesses we acquire in the future may also be subject to rate regulation or similar negotiating limitations.\nFailure to comply with government regulations could result in contract terminations or we may be unable to enter into future government contracts.\nFrom time to time, we sign government contracts that are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations which could result in withholding or delay of payments. In addition, government contracts are subject to specific regulations as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping, and accounting. These regulations and laws impact how we transact business with governmental clients and, in some instances, impose significant costs on business operations. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing government contracts could be terminated, and we could be temporarily or permanently barred from government contracting or subcontracting. If one or more of our government contracts are terminated or if we are barred from government contract work, or if reimbursement of our cost is disallowed, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue and profits.\nDelays in the government budget process or a government shutdown may adversely affect our operating results.\nCertain of our businesses provide services to government customers, often under long-term contracts. Any delay in the federal or state government budget process or a federal or state government shutdown may result in our incurring substantial costs without reimbursement under these contracts for extended periods. In addition, our businesses rely on obtaining and maintaining government permits, licenses, concessions, and leases. Governmental budget delays or government shutdowns could also negatively impact our ability to timely obtain approvals and consents needed to operate and grow our businesses. Any of these consequences could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nClimate change, climate change regulations, and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets.\nClimate change and the outcome of federal and state actions to address global climate change could result in significant new regulations, additional changes to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. These actions could increase the cost of operating our businesses, reduce the demand for our products and services, and impact the prices we charge our customers, any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, climate change could make severe weather events more frequent and increase the likelihood of capital expenditures to replace damaged physical property at our businesses.\nRestrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for, price of, and value of our products and reserves. As our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly, current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs. Future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions could adversely impact our businesses.\nRisks Related to Atlantic Aviation\nCOVID-19 has significantly reduced demand for Atlantic Aviation\u2019s products and services.\nThe general reaction to COVID-19, as well as governmental travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and prohibitions on large public gatherings, and the deterioration in economic conditions, have significantly reduced GA activity and the demand for Atlantic Aviation\u2019s products and services. The sustained impact of COVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity of Atlantic Aviation.\nThe effects of COVID-19 on future consumer preferences and demand for Atlantic Aviation\u2019s services is unknown.\nPreferences for air travel and specifically GA are unknown and may change following COVID-19. There has been a substantial shift in flight activity and patterns during COVID-19, and there can be no certainty that overall activity or activity at the specific locations Atlantic Aviation operates will return to prior levels. Atlantic Aviation\u2019s financial results may be materially impacted by ongoing reductions or shifts in activity levels. An increase in the adoption and ongoing utilization of technology solutions to enable remote communication may contribute to a reduction or shift in activity levels.\nDeterioration in the economy in general or in the aviation industry that results in less air traffic at the airports on which Atlantic Aviation operates would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nA large part of the business\u2019 revenue derived from providing services to GA customers and, to a lesser extent, commercial, freight, and military customers. An economic downturn could reduce the level of air traffic, adversely affecting Atlantic Aviation.\nAir travel and air traffic can also be affected by events that stem from national, local, or industry specific matters. Events such as wars, outbreaks of disease, severe weather, and terrorist activities in the U.S. or overseas may reduce air traffic. Local circumstances include downturns in the economic conditions of the area in which an airport is located or the relocation of FBO customers to alternative airports.\nIn addition, changes to regulations governing the tax treatment relating to GA travel, either for businesses or individuals, may cause a reduction in GA travel. Increased environmental regulation restricting or increasing the cost of aviation activities could also cause the business\u2019 revenue to decline.\nA decline in financial markets activity could have a negative impact on Atlantic Aviation\u2019s results of operations.\nAtlantic Aviation's financial results may be adversely affected by a deterioration in domestic and/or international financial markets activity. A deterioration in either equity or credit markets and its impact on the value of debt or equity issuances and/or merger and acquisition activity may cause GA activity to decline and negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nA significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the revenue and/or profitability of Atlantic Aviation.\nHigher prices for jet fuel could result in reduction in the use of aircraft by GA customers, which would have a negative impact on the profitability of Atlantic Aviation. Higher fuel prices could also increase the cost of power to Atlantic Aviation generally and they may not be able to fully pass the increase through to customers.\nAtlantic Aviation is subject to a variety of competitive pressures, and the actions of competitors may have a material adverse effect on its revenue, market share, and fuel margins, causing a decline in the profitability of this business.\nFBO operators at an airport compete based on factors including location of their facilities relative to runways and street access, service, value added features, reliability, and price. Many of Atlantic Aviation\u2019s FBOs compete with one or more FBOs at their respective airports and with FBOs at nearby airports. Furthermore, leases related to FBO operations may be subject to competitive bidding at the end of their term. Some present and potential competitors may have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than Atlantic Aviation, which may negatively impact Atlantic Aviation\u2019s ability to compete at each airport or for lease renewal. Certain competitors may aggressively or irrationally price their bids for airport leases and may limit the business\u2019 ability to grow or renew its portfolio. Excessive price discounting may cause a decline in market share or the amount of fuel sold, declines in hangar rentals, and/or de-icing and may result in increased margin pressure, adversely affecting the profitability of this business. The continued growth and consolidation of large fractional, charter and jet card/membership entities among Atlantic Aviation\u2019s customer base may increase price discounting and competition as the entities increase purchasing scale and sophistication.\nAtlantic Aviation\u2019s FBOs do not have the right to be the sole provider of FBO services at any airport. The authority responsible for each airport may grant leases to additional operators and new competitors could be established at those airports. The addition of new competitors may reduce or impair Atlantic Aviation\u2019s ability to grow or improve its financial performance.\nAirport leases may not be renewed on economically favorable terms.\nAtlantic Aviation generates revenue pursuant to leases granted by airport authorities. Airport authorities may choose not to renew a lease at all or to only renew the lease on terms which are unfavorable to Atlantic Aviation. In addition, airport authorities may require Atlantic Aviation to participate in a bidding process to renew a lease, which could require unanticipated capital spending and could divert management\u2019s attention during the pendency of the process. The loss or modification of any of Atlantic Aviation\u2019s airport leases could adversely impact its results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nThe termination for cause or convenience of one or more of the FBO leases would damage Atlantic Aviation\u2019s operations significantly.\nAtlantic Aviation\u2019s revenue is derived from long-term leases granted by airport authorities on 69 airports in the U.S. If Atlantic Aviation defaults on the terms or conditions of its leases, the relevant authority may terminate the lease without compensation. Atlantic Aviation would then lose the income from that location and potentially the expected returns from prior capital expenditures. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on Atlantic Aviation\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nFailure to adequately maintain the facilities comprising our FBOs or the integrity of our fuel supplies may have a material adverse impact on the revenue or market share of one or more of the FBOs in the network resulting in a decline in profitability of the business.\nFBO operators compete in part based on the overall quality and attractiveness of their facilities as well as the safety of their operations. Inadequate maintenance of any of the hangars, terminals, ramps, or other assets comprising Atlantic Aviation\u2019s FBOs could result in customers\u2019 electing not to utilize Atlantic Aviation where another provider operates or to elect not to use a particular airport where an alternative in the same market exists. The resulting decline in customer visits or negative impact on reputation could adversely impact revenue from fuel sales, hangar/office rental, ramp, and/or ramp services fees and could impact more than one facility.\nAircraft owners and operators rely on FBOs to control the quality of the fuel they sell. Failure to maintain the integrity of fuel supplies as a result of inadequate or inappropriate procedure or maintenance of fuel farms (storage facilities), fuel trucks, or related equipment could result in the introduction of contaminants and could lead to damage or failure of aircraft and could adversely impact the reputation, revenue, and/or profitability of the business.\nFailure to complete, or realize anticipated performance from acquisitions, expansions or developments could negatively impact Atlantic Aviation. The business\u2019 increased indebtedness to fund such acquisitions, expansions, or developments could reduce our operating flexibility.\nCompleting acquisitions, expansions, or developments are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and we may not complete such projects on a timely basis or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nFBO industry participants are often smaller, private companies with less sophisticated information systems and financial reporting and control capabilities. If we complete an acquisition, we may be unable to integrate the assets into our existing operations on a timely basis or to achieve expected efficiencies. The integration could be expensive and could be time consuming for our management.\nWe may not be able to achieve anticipated levels of financial performance at the acquired FBO within our expected time frames or at all. Atlantic Aviation may incur additional indebtedness to fund future acquisitions, expansions, or developments. This increased level of indebtedness will increase interest expense and could reduce funds available for reinvestment or distribution to us.\nDeterioration of GA air traffic at airports where Atlantic Aviation operates would decrease Atlantic Aviation\u2019s ability to refinance or service its debt.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Atlantic Aviation had $1,005 million of term loan debt outstanding. This debt facility requires compliance with certain covenants. Atlantic Aviation's ability to meet its debt service obligations and to refinance or repay its outstanding indebtedness will depend primarily upon cash flows it generates.\nReductions in U.S. military spending could result in a reduction in demand for services provided by Atlantic Aviation at certain airports in the U.S.\nThe U.S. military operates aircraft that are serviced at Atlantic Aviation FBOs. Cuts in U.S. military spending, to the extent they result in a reduction in the number of flights by military aircraft, could reduce revenue and gross margin at Atlantic Aviation. Deployments or other changes in military operations may also reduce the number of military aircraft serviced by Atlantic Aviation, reducing revenue and gross margin.\nAtlantic Aviation is subject to extensive governmental regulations that could require significant expenditures. Regulators, such as the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), have and may again consider regulations which could impair the relative convenience of GA and adversely affect demand for Atlantic Aviation\u2019s services.\nFBOs are subject to extensive regulatory requirements compliance with which could result in significant costs. For example, the FAA, from time to time, issues directives and other regulations relating to the management, maintenance, and operation of airport facilities. Compliance with those requirements may cause Atlantic Aviation to incur significant expenditures. The proposal and enactment of additional laws and regulations, as well as any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could significantly increase the cost of Atlantic Aviation\u2019s operations and reduce overall revenue. In addition, certain new regulations, if implemented, could decrease the convenience and attractiveness of GA travel relative to commercial air travel and may adversely impact demand for Atlantic Aviation\u2019s services.\nThe lack of accurate and reliable industry data can result in unfavorable strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions, and macro pricing decisions.\nAtlantic Aviation uses industry and airport-specific GA traffic data published by the FAA as well as data from private sources to identify trends in the FBO industry. The business also uses this traffic data as a key input to decision-making in strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions, and macro pricing matters. However, both the public and private data has several limitations and challenges. As a result, the use of such traffic data may result in conclusions in strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions, or macro pricing decisions that are ultimately sub-optimal.\nChanges in regulations related to the use of certain firefighting systems could result in Atlantic Aviation incurring additional expenses associated with modifying or replacing these systems, and remediation costs relating to the use of these systems could be substantial.\nAtlantic Aviation employs foam-based firefighting systems in certain of its hangars as required by local laws and regulation. Some of these utilize materials that have been, in certain jurisdictions, deemed hazardous substances. If Atlantic\nAviation were to be required to modify or replace some or all of these systems, the expense associated with such modification or replacement could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition of the business. In addition, the cost of remediation in connection with the release of firefighting foam could be substantial.\nRisks Related to MIC Hawaii\nCOVID-19 has significantly reduced demand for Hawaii Gas\u2019 products and services, and Hawaii Gas may experience supply chain disruption.\nCOVID-19 has greatly reduced the number of visitors to Hawaii, which has significantly reduced the demand for gas from Hawaii Gas' customers, particularly hotels and restaurants. Hawaii Gas\u2019 SNG plant is subject to minimum operating thresholds, and if demand declines such that the SNG plant is not producing the requisite daily volume of SNG to operate safely, the plant will be shut down until minimum production thresholds can again be met. While Hawaii Gas has developed and tested alternatives for the delivery of gas to its utility customers in the event production at the SNG plant is stopped, there can be no assurances that these alternatives would operate as designed or be as effective and efficient from an operating or financial performance perspective as operating the SNG plant. Additionally, the reliability and pricing of the feedstock supply for the SNG plant could be adversely impacted by COVID-19, potentially resulting in higher cost of gas which would be passed onto Hawaii Gas' customers. The sustained impact of COVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity of MIC Hawaii.\nHawaii Gas is exposed to the effects of volatility in commodity prices. To the extent that higher prices cannot be effectively hedged or passed on to customers, both in the short term or the long term, the business\u2019 gross margin, cash flows, and liquidity will be adversely affected.\nThe profitability of Hawaii Gas is based on the margin of sales prices over costs. LPG, LNG, and feedstock for the SNG plant are commodities and changes in global supply of and demand for these products can have a significant impact on costs. Hawaii Gas has no control over commodity prices and, to the extent that these prices cannot be hedged or passed on to customers, the business\u2019 results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nDepending on the terms of our contracts with suppliers, as well as the extent and success of our use of financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to volatility in the cost of LPG, changes in the market price of Hawaii Gas\u2019 fuel supplies could create payment obligations that expose the business to increased liquidity risk.\nHawaii Gas enters into commodity hedge contracts to hedge against financial risks of commodity price fluctuations of its LPG purchases. Depending on the terms of the commodity hedge contracts, as well as the business' ability to forecast its sales volumes, changes in the expected volumes sold and changes in the market price of Hawaii Gas\u2019 commodity hedge contracts could create payment obligations that effect the business' results of operations, cash flows, and financial conditions.\nThe operations of Hawaii Gas are subject to a variety of competitive pressures and the actions of competitors could have a material adverse effect on operating results.\nEnergy resources including diesel, solar, geo-thermal, and wind, may be substituted for gas in certain end-use applications, particularly if the price of gas increases relative to these resources, whether due to higher costs or otherwise. Customers could elect to meet their energy needs through any or all of these alternate resources as a result of higher gas prices, lower costs of alternative generation resources, or convenience. This could have an adverse effect on the business\u2019 results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nHawaii Gas relies on its SNG plant, including its transmission pipeline, for a significant portion of its sales. Disruptions at that facility could adversely affect the business\u2019 ability to serve customers.\nDisruptions at the SNG plant resulting from mechanical or operational issues or power failures could affect Hawaii Gas' ability to produce SNG. Most of the utility sales on Oahu are of SNG and all SNG is produced at the Oahu plant. Hawaii Gas has a back-up system in place, however, disruptions to both the primary and the back-up systems could have a significant adverse effect on Hawaii Gas\u2019 results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nHawaii Gas obtains its feedstock for its SNG plant from a refinery located on Oahu and sources its LPG supply from an off-island distributor. Supply disruptions may have an adverse effect on the operations of the business.\nThe extended unavailability of the refinery that supplies SNG feedstock, or the inability to purchase LPG from off-island sources, could adversely affect operations. The business has a limited ability to store LPG, and any disruption in supply may cause a depletion of LPG stocks. Disruptions in the supply of SNG or LPG, if occurring for an extended period, could materially adversely impact the business\u2019 results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nThe MIC Hawaii businesses are subject to risks associated with volatility in the Hawaii economy.\nHawaii\u2019s economy and demand for our business\u2019 products are heavily influenced by economic conditions in the U.S. and Asia and their impact on tourism, including the impact of post COVID-19 demand for travel, as well as by government spending. If the decline in the tourism industry in Hawaii is sustained, or there are changes in travel behavior post COVID-19, or the local economy deteriorates, the amount of gas sold by Hawaii Gas could be negatively affected by business closures or reduced consumption, which could adversely impact the business\u2019 financial performance. Additionally, slow, or no economic growth in Hawaii could adversely impact the amount of gas sold to new and existing customers and reduce the level of new commercial and residential construction. A reduction in visitors to Hawaii or government activity in Hawaii, particularly military activity could also have a negative impact on the MIC Hawaii businesses.\nHawaii Gas\u2019 utility business is subject to regulation by the HPUC and actions by the HPUC or changes to the regulatory environment may constrain the operation or profitability of the business.\nThe HPUC regulates all public service companies operating in Hawaii. The HPUC prescribes rates, tariffs, charges and fees; determines the allowable rate of return on equity; issues guidelines concerning the general management of utility businesses and acts on requests for the acquisition, sale, disposition or other exchange of utility properties, including mergers and consolidations.\nAny adverse decision by the HPUC concerning the level or method of determining utility rates, the items and amounts that may be included in the rate base, the returns on equity or rate base, the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOn November 25, 2020, the HPUC initiated further proceedings consistent with the Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s order remanding the rate case for consideration, among other things, of greenhouse gas emission occurring outside the state's borders. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this proceeding, or the effects of that outcome on Hawaii Gas.\nNatural gas has increasingly been the subject of political and public scrutiny, including a desire by some to further limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source. The enactment of state legislation in 2018 requiring Hawaii to be carbon neutral by 2045 or a potential Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) for utility gas usage or supply, similar to the one implemented for electric utility generation, could result in supply disruptions, increased energy costs to ratepayers or a negative impact on Hawaii Gas\u2019 future financial performance.\nThe Hawaii legislature or municipal governments could impose a gas RPS, enact other restrictive legislation or impose changes to building codes, which may result in increased energy costs to the business and its customers (i.e. the cost of finding new renewable fuel supplies or developing new technologies could be prohibitive), in supply disruptions and/or in restriction of existing and future business. Similar impacts could result from the enactment of the carbon neutrality legislation in 2018.\nHawaii Gas seeks to increase its use of renewable feedstocks and to increase the percentage of RNG distributed to its customers. This initiative exposes Hawaii Gas to new technology, supply, counterparty, and regulatory risks that could impact the performance of the business.\nHawaii Gas is pursuing a range of renewable resources that may provide pipeline quality gas in scalable quantities. These initiatives include the current contract for recovery of biogas from the Honouliuli wastewater treatment plant and ongoing discussions with operators of additional wastewater treatment plants and landfills, and with biomass producers. Blending of RNG with existing fuels and integrating RNG into the Hawaii Gas\u2019 pipeline network may present technical challenges resulting in project delays, cost overruns or pipeline disruptions. Use of RNG may also expose Hawaii Gas to the risk of supply fluctuations due to the variability in performance of processes such as anaerobic digestion. These technical and supply risks may impact the financial performance of the business.\nBecause of its geographic location, Hawaii, and in turn the MIC Hawaii businesses, are subject to earthquakes, volcanos, and certain weather risks that could materially disrupt operations.\nHawaii is subject to earthquakes, volcanic activity, and certain weather risks, such as hurricanes, floods, heavy and sustained rains, and tidal waves that could materially disrupt operations. Because MIC Hawaii\u2019s properties, such as its SNG plant, SNG transmission line and several storage facilities, are close to the ocean, weather-related disruptions to operations are possible. In addition, earthquakes and volcanic activity may cause disruptions. These events could damage the business\u2019 assets or could result in wide-spread damage to its customers, thereby reducing the amount of gas sold and, to the extent such damages are not covered by insurance, adversely impacting the business\u2019 results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nReductions in U.S. military spending could result in a reduction in demand for gas in Hawaii.\nThe U.S. military has a significant presence in Hawaii and is a substantial contributor to its economy. To the extent that federal spending cuts, including voluntary or mandatory cuts in U.S. military spending results in a reduced military presence in Hawaii, such reductions could reduce the demand for gas and new construction in Hawaii.\nBecause of its geographic location and the unique economy of Hawaii, MIC Hawaii is subject to challenges in hiring and maintaining staff with specialized skill sets.\nThe changing nature of the Hawaii energy complex has had an impact on the business' staffing requirements. Volatility in feedstock prices, together with the impact of the State of Hawaii\u2019s goals to reduce dependency on imported petroleum, requires staff with specialized knowledge of the energy sector. Because the resident labor pool in Hawaii is both small and oriented mainly to Hawaii\u2019s basic industries, it is difficult to find individuals with these specialized skill sets. Unemployment rates in Hawaii are traditionally lower than those in the U.S. Mainland. Moreover, relocation to Hawaii is costly and often requires employees to make cultural and family adjustments not normally required in a relocation. The inability to source and retain staff with appropriate skill sets could adversely impact the performance of the MIC Hawaii businesses. In addition, dependence on skilled labor trades could result in constraints on growth and profitability related to competition for a limited labor pool.\nHawaii Gas\u2019 operations on the islands of Hawaii, Maui and Kauai rely on LPG that is transported from Oahu to those islands by Jones Act qualified barges and by non-Jones Act vessels from off-island ports. Disruptions to service by those vessels could adversely affect the financial performance of our business.\nThe Jones Act requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried in U.S.-flag ships and that they meet certain other requirements. The business has time charter agreements for the only two Jones Act qualified barges available in Hawaii capable of carrying large amounts of LPG. If the barges are unable to transport LPG from Oahu and the business is not able to secure off-island sources of LPG or obtain an exemption to the Jones Act that would permit importation of a sufficient quantity of LPG from the mainland U.S., the business could be adversely affected. If the barges require refurbishment or repair at a greater frequency than forecast, cash outflows for capital costs could adversely impact Hawaii Gas\u2019 results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nGeneration underperformance at individual projects within MIC Hawaii could lead to financial penalties or contract terminations under existing off-take agreements.\nCertain distributed generation projects have minimum production terms included in their respective power purchase agreements. These minimum production levels are specified in each respective contract. Failure to meet these minimum production levels, could result in liquidated damages, other financial penalties, or contract termination which could negatively impact the business\u2019 results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nCertain MIC Hawaii projects depend on electric interconnection and transmission facilities that we do not own or control and that are potentially subject to transmission constraints. If these facilities fail to provide adequate transmission capacity, MIC Hawaii projects may be restricted in their ability to deliver electricity to customers.\nMIC Hawaii\u2019s electricity generation facilities depend on grid interconnection and transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the power they produce. Certain off-taker contracts include limited provisions allowing for occasional curtailment of electricity generated by MIC Hawaii due to the limitations of the electricity transmission system. Any constraints on, or the failure of, interconnections or transmission facilities could prevent MIC Hawaii from selling power and could adversely affect MIC Hawaii\u2019s results of operations, cash flows ,and financial condition.\nMIC Hawaii depends on counterparties, including operation and maintenance (O&M) providers and power purchasers, performing in accordance with their agreements. If they fail to so perform, our MIC Hawaii businesses could incur losses of revenue or additional expenses and business disruptions.\nCounterparties to long-term agreements with MIC Hawaii businesses may not meet their obligations in accordance with such agreements. Should they fail to perform for any reason, MIC Hawaii may be required to seek alternative O&M providers. The failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could adversely affect MIC Hawaii\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Having an External Manager\nWe are subject to the terms and conditions of the Management Services Agreement and Disposition Agreement between us and our Manager, which limit our ability to take certain actions and may make strategic transactions more costly.\nWe cannot unilaterally amend the Management Services Agreement between us and our Manager. Changes in the compensation of our Manager, certain rights held by our Manager or other components of the Management Services Agreement require the approval of our Manager and limit our ability to make changes that could be beneficial to stockholders generally without the consent of our Manager.\nOn October 30, 2019, we signed a Disposition Agreement with our Manager to facilitate our pursuit of strategic alternatives (see Exhibit 10.3 of this Form 10-K). Outside of this agreement, we do not have the ability to terminate the Management Services Agreement other than in limited circumstances. With this agreement, our Management Services Agreement with our Manager will terminate as to any businesses, or substantial portions thereof, that are sold and, in connection therewith, we will make payments to our Manager calculated in accordance with the Disposition Agreement. The Disposition Agreement will terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) the termination of the Management Services Agreement and (ii) the sixth anniversary, subject to extension under certain circumstances if a transaction is pending.\nOur Manager owns a significant portion of our outstanding stock. A sale of all or a portion of the common stock owned by our Manager could be interpreted by the equity markets as a lack of confidence in our prospects.\nOur Manager, in its sole discretion, determines whether to reinvest base management and performance fees, if any, in shares of our common stock and whether to hold or sell those securities. Reinvestment of base management and performance fees, if any, in additional common stock would increase our Manager\u2019s ownership stake in our Company. On December 31, 2020, our Manager owned 15.97% of our outstanding shares. Our Manager has sold and could from time to time sell the shares that it acquires via reinvestment of fees. If our Manager decides to sell any of its shares in our Company, such sales may be interpreted by some market participants as a lack of confidence in our Company and put downward pressure on the market price of our stock. Sales of shares of stock by our Manager would increase the supply and could decrease the price if demand is insufficient to absorb such sales.\nCertain provisions of our Management Services Agreement, certificate of incorporation, and bylaws make it difficult for third parties to acquire control of our Company and could deprive investors of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for their shares of common stock.\nSubject to terms of the Disposition Agreement, there are limited circumstances in which our Manager can be terminated under our Management Services Agreement. The Management Services Agreement provides that in circumstances where our common stock ceases to be listed on a recognized U.S. exchange as a result of the acquisition of our common stock by third parties in an amount that results in our common stock ceasing to meet the distribution and trading criteria on such exchange or market, our Manager has the option to either propose an alternate fee structure and remain as our Manager or resign, terminate the Management Services Agreement upon 30 days\u2019 written notice and be paid a substantial termination fee. The termination fee payable on our Manager\u2019s exercise of its right to resign as our Manager subsequent to a delisting of our common stock could delay or prevent a change in control that may favor our stockholders. Furthermore, in the event of such a delisting, any proceeds from the sale, lease, or exchange of a significant amount of assets must be reinvested in new assets of our Company, subject to debt repayment obligations. We would also be prohibited from incurring any new indebtedness or engaging in any transactions with stockholders or our affiliates without the prior written approval of our Manager. These provisions could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize a premium on the common stock owned by them. The Disposition Agreement provides that the Management Services Agreement will terminate as to any businesses, or substantial portions thereof, that are sold, and certain payments will be made to our Manager in connection therewith.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or discouraging a third-party from acquiring, control of our Company. These provisions include:\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to enter into certain transactions with our major stockholders, with the exception of our Manager; similar restrictions are also contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law;\n\u2022allowing only our Board to fill vacancies, including newly created directorships, and requiring that directors may be removed with or without cause by a stockholder vote of 66 2/3%;\n\u2022requiring that only the chairman or Board may call a special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholders from taking any action by written consent;\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our stockholders at a stockholders\u2019 meeting; and\n\u2022having a substantial number of additional shares of common stock authorized but unissued.\nOur Manager\u2019s decision to reinvest its monthly base management fees and quarterly performance fees, if any, in common stock or retain the cash will affect stockholders differently.\nOur Manager is paid a base management fee based on our market capitalization and potentially performance fees based on the total return generated relative to a U.S. utilities index benchmark. Our Manager, in its sole discretion, may elect to retain base management fees and performance fees, if any, paid in cash or to reinvest such payments in additional common stock. In the event our Manager chooses not to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional shares of common stock, the amount paid will reduce the cash that may otherwise be distributed as a dividend to all stockholders or used in our Company\u2019s operations. In the event our Manager chooses to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional common stock, effectively returning the cash to us, such reinvestment and the issuance of new shares of common stock will dilute existing stockholders by the increase in the percentage of common stock owned by our Manager. Either option may adversely impact the market for our shares.\nIn addition, our Manager has typically elected to invest its fees in shares of common stock, and, unless otherwise agreed with us, can only change this election during a 20-trading day window following our earnings release. Any change would apply to fees incurred thereafter. Accordingly, stockholders would generally have notice of our Manager\u2019s intent to receive fees in cash rather than reinvest before the change was effective.\nOur Manager is not required to offer all acquisition opportunities to us and may offer such opportunities to other entities. Our management may waive investment opportunities presented by our Manager.\nPursuant to our Management Services Agreement, we have first priority ahead of all current and future funds, investment vehicles, separate accounts, and other entities managed by our Manager or by members of the Macquarie Group with respect to four specific types of acquisition opportunities within the United States. These include FBOs, airport parking, district energy, and \u201cuser pays\u201d, contracted, and regulated assets that represent an investment of greater than AUD $40 million. Other than these types of opportunities, our Manager does not have an obligation to offer to us any particular acquisition opportunities, even if they meet our investment objectives, and our Manager and its affiliates can offer any or all other acquisition opportunities on a priority basis or otherwise to current and future funds, investment vehicles, and accounts sponsored by our Manager or its affiliates. Our businesses may compete with these entities for investment opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will prevail with respect to such investments.\nIn addition, our management may determine not to pursue investment opportunities presented to us by our Manager, including those presented on a priority basis. If our management waives any such opportunity, our Manager and its affiliates may offer such opportunity to any other entity, including any entities sponsored or advised by members of the Macquarie Group. As such, not every acquisition opportunity presented to us by our Manager may be pursued by us and may ultimately be presented to entities with whom we compete for investments.\nOur Manager can resign with 90 days\u2019 notice, and our CEO or CFO could be removed by our Manager, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations, which could adversely affect our financial results and negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nOur Manager has the right, under the Management Services Agreement, to resign at any time with 90 days\u2019 notice, whether we have found a replacement manager or not. In addition, our Manager could re-assign or remove our CEO and/or our CFO from their positions and responsibilities at our Company without our Board's approval and with little or no notice. If our Manager resigns or our CEO and/or CFO are removed, we may not be able to find a new external manager or hire internal management with similar expertise within 90 days to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial results could be adversely affected, perhaps materially, and the market price of our common stock may decline substantially. In addition, the coordination of our internal management, acquisition activities, and supervision of our businesses is likely to suffer if we were unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our Manager and its affiliates.\nFurthermore, if our Manager resigns, we and our subsidiaries will be required to cease use of the Macquarie brand and change their names to remove any reference to \u201cMacquarie\u201d. This may cause the value of our Company and the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur externally managed model may not be viewed favorably by investors.\nWe are externally managed by a member of the Macquarie Group. Our Manager receives a fee for the corporate headquarters functions it provides including the compensation of our management team and those who provide services to us on a shared basis, health and welfare benefits, the provision of facilities, technology, and insurance (other than directors and officers). The fee is based on our equity market capitalization and thus increases as we grow. The size of the fee may bear no\ndirect correlation with the actual cost of providing the agreed upon services and may be higher than the cost of managing our Company internally. Per the terms of the Management Services Agreement with our Manager, the current default election for satisfying any base management or performance fees, if any, to which our Manager may be entitled is the issuance of additional shares of common stock. To the extent fees continue to be reinvested in our common stock, all stockholders will be diluted and our hurdle for growing distributable cash on a per share basis will be higher.\nOur Manager\u2019s affiliation with Macquarie Group Limited and the Macquarie Group may result in conflicts of interest or a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur Manager is an affiliate of Macquarie Group Limited and a member of the Macquarie Group. From time to time, we have entered into, and in the future, we may enter into, transactions and relationships involving Macquarie Group Limited, its affiliates, or other members of the Macquarie Group. Such transactions have included and may include, among other things, the entry into debt facilities and derivative instruments with members of the Macquarie Group serving as lender or counterparty, and financial advisory or equity and debt underwriting services provided to us by the Macquarie Group.\nAlthough our Audit Committee, all of the members of which are independent directors, is required to review and approve in advance of any related party transactions, including those involving members of the Macquarie Group or its affiliates, the relationship of our Manager to the Macquarie Group may result in conflicts of interest.\nIn addition, as a result of our Manager\u2019s being a member of the Macquarie Group, negative market perceptions of Macquarie Group Limited generally or of Macquarie\u2019s infrastructure management model, or Macquarie Group statements or actions with respect to other managed vehicles, may affect market perceptions of us and cause a decline in the price of our common stock unrelated to our financial performance and prospects.\nIn the event of the underperformance of our Manager, we may be unable to remove our Manager, which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nUnder the terms of the Management Services Agreement, our Manager must significantly underperform for the Management Services Agreement to be terminated. Our Board cannot remove our Manager unless:\n\u2022our common stock underperforms a weighted average of two benchmark indices by more than 30% in relative terms and more than 2.5% in absolute terms in 16 out of 20 consecutive quarters prior to and including the most recent full quarter, and the holders of a minimum of 66.67% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (excluding any shares owned by our Manager or any affiliate of our Manager) vote to remove our Manager;\n\u2022our Manager materially breaches the terms of the Management Services Agreement and such breach has been unremedied within 60 days after notice;\n\u2022our Manager acts with gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of its duties in carrying out its obligations under the Management Services Agreement, or engages in fraudulent or dishonest acts; or\n\u2022our Manager experiences certain bankruptcy events.\nOur Board cannot remove our Manager unless the market performance of our common stock also significantly underperforms the benchmark index. If we were unable to remove our Manager in circumstances where the absolute market performance of our common stock does not meet expectations, the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\nOur guidance is based on estimates and circumstances may arise that may result in our failing to meet those estimates.\nWe periodically disclose our expected annual EBITDA excluding non-cash items and/or Free Cash Flow (as defined by us). These are estimates and may be affected by inaccurate assumptions and/or known or unknown risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d If the generation of EBITDA excluding non-cash items or Free Cash Flow at the anticipated level would leave us with insufficient cash to take timely advantage of growth opportunities (including through acquisitions), to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements, to reduce our indebtedness, to fund our operations, or to otherwise properly address our business prospects, pay or increase any dividend, our stock price could be adversely affected.\nThe market price and marketability of our common stock may from time to time be significantly affected by numerous factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Many factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price and marketability of our common stock and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through equity financings should we need or want to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of Macquarie Group Limited and/or vehicles managed by the Macquarie Group or branded under the Macquarie name or logo;\n\u2022significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered investment companies, business development companies, or companies in our sectors;\n\u2022the conclusion of a sale or sales of businesses in connection with our pursuit of strategic alternatives or the termination of such efforts;\n\u2022changes in our earnings or variations in operating results;\n\u2022changes in our ratings from any of the ratings agencies;\n\u2022any shortfall in EBITDA excluding non-cash items or Free Cash Flow from levels expected by us or by securities analysts;\n\u2022changes in regulatory policies or tax law;\n\u2022operating performance of companies comparable to us;\n\u2022loss of funding sources; and\n\u2022substantial sales of our common stock by our Manager or other significant stockholders.\nThe performances of our businesses or our holding company structure may limit our ability to make regular dividends in the future to our stockholders because we are reliant upon the cash flows and distributions from our businesses.\nOur Company is a holding company with no operations. We are dependent upon the ability of our businesses to make distributions to our Company to enable it to meet its expenses, and to pay, maintain or grow dividends to stockholders in the future. The ability of our operating subsidiaries and the businesses we own to make distributions to our Company is subject to their operating performance, their need for capital, the terms of their debt agreements, and the applicable laws of their respective jurisdictions. In addition, the ability of each business to reduce its outstanding debt will be similarly limited by its operating performance.\nActions of activist stockholders could have an adverse impact on the value of our securities.\nWe value constructive input from our stockholders and the investment community. However, there is no assurance that the actions taken by our Board and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful. Certain of our stockholders may express views with respect to the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations or other matters that are contrary to ours. Responding to these, or to actions that may be taken by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees. The perceived uncertainties as to our strategy as a result of the actions of activist stockholders could affect the market price of our securities, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, board members, and business partners.\nWe are currently subject to putative securities class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits and could become subject to other similar actions in the future, the unfavorable outcome of which could have a materially adverse impact our business, or results of operations.\nIn April 2018, two lawsuits seeking to establish class actions were filed against us and certain current and former officers of our Company and one of our subsidiaries. These lawsuits allege violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and knowing material misstatements and omissions in our public disclosures concerning our business and the sustainability of our dividend to stockholders. In addition, three shareholder derivative complaints were filed asserting derivative claims on behalf of the Company against certain current and former officers and directors, arising out of the same subject matter at issue in the securities class action lawsuits. While we intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits, there is no assurance that we will be successful in the defense or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of the actions. In addition, we are obligated to indemnify and incur legal expenses on behalf of current and former officers under certain circumstances. These lawsuits, and any similar proceedings or claims that may be brought against us in the future, may divert management resources and cause us to incur substantial costs, and any unfavorable outcome could result in payment of damages and could adversely affect our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse impact our business and results of operations.\nThe price of our stock may be vulnerable to actions of market participants whose strategies may not involve buying and holding our securities in pursuit of an attractive return.\nOur common stock has been the subject of short selling efforts by certain market participants. Short sales are transactions in which a market participant borrows, then sells a security that it does not own. The market participant is obligated to replace the security borrowed by purchasing the security at or before the time the security is recalled. If the price at the time of replacement/recall is lower than the price at which the security was originally sold by the market participant, then the market participant will realize a gain on the transaction. Thus, it is in the market participant\u2019s interest for the price of the security to decline during the period up to the time of replacement/recall.\nPrevious short selling efforts have had an impact on, and may in the future impact, the value of our stock in an extreme and volatile manner to our detriment and the detriment of our stockholders. In addition, market participants have published, and may in the future publish, negative, inaccurate, or misleading information regarding our Company and our management team. We believe that the publication of such information has led, and may in the future lead to, significant downward pressure on the price of our stock to our detriment and the further detriment of our stockholders. These and other efforts by certain market participants to unduly influence the price of our common stock for financial gain may cause value of our stockholders\u2019 investments to decline, may make it more difficult for us to raise equity capital when or if needed without significantly diluting existing stockholders, and may reduce demand from new investors to purchase our shares.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and the failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process, and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and our access to capital. In addition, implementing any appropriate changes to internal controls will result in additional expenses.\nWe may issue preferred stock with rights, preferences, and privileges that may be superior to the common stock, and these could have negative consequences for holders of our common stock.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in one or more financing transactions. We may also use the authorized preferred stock for funding transactions, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, business combinations and investments, although we have no immediate plans to do so. We cannot provide assurances that any such transaction will be consummated on favorable terms or at all, that they will enhance stockholder value, or that it will not adversely affect our business or the trading price of our common stock. Any shares of preferred stock could be issued with rights, preferences, and privileges that may be superior to those of our common stock. In addition, preferred stock could be issued for capital raising, financing and acquisition needs or opportunities that have the effect of making an acquisition of our Company more difficult or costly, as could also be the case if the Board were to issue additional common stock.\nOur reported Earnings per Share (EPS), as defined under GAAP, does not reflect the cash generated by our businesses and may result in unfavorable comparisons with other businesses.\nOur businesses own and invest in high-value, long-lived assets that generate substantial amounts of depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that serve to reduce reported EPS. We pay our Manager base management fees and may pay performance fees both of which may be reinvested in additional shares thereby rendering them a non-cash expense. Whether the fees are settled in cash or reinvested in additional shares, they have the effect of reducing EPS. As a result, our financial performance may appear to be substantially worse compared with other businesses. To the extent that our results appear to be worse, we may have relatively greater difficulty attracting investors in our stock.\nOur total assets include a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. The write-off of a significant portion of intangible assets would negatively affect our reported earnings.\nOur total assets reflect a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. On December 31, 2020, goodwill and other intangible assets, net, represented approximately 26% of our total assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were generated primarily through the acquisitions of our businesses. Other intangible assets consist primarily of airport operating rights, customer relationships, and trade names. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether there has been any impairment in the value of goodwill and other intangible assets or when there are triggering events or circumstances. If the carrying value of the tested asset exceeds its estimated fair value, impairment is deemed to have occurred. In that event, the intangible is written down to fair value. Under current accounting rules, this would result in a charge to reported earnings. Impairments requiring the\nwrite-off of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our reported earnings and total capitalization and could be material.\nOur total assets include a substantial amount of intangible assets and fixed assets. The depreciation and amortization of these assets may negatively impact our reported earnings.\nThe high level of intangible and physical assets written up to fair value upon acquisition of our businesses generates substantial amounts of depreciation and amortization. These non-cash items serve to lower net income as reported in our consolidated statement of operations as well as our taxable income. The generation of net losses or relatively small net income may contribute to a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward that can be used to offset current taxable income in future periods. However, the continued reporting of little or negative net income may adversely affect the attractiveness of our Company to some potential investors and may reduce the market for our common stock.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nThe current treatment of qualified dividend income and long-term capital gains under U.S. federal income tax law may be changed in the future.\nUnder current law, qualified dividend income and long-term capital gains are taxed to non-corporate investors at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. In addition, certain holders that are individuals, estates, or trusts are subject to 3.8% surtax on all or a portion of their \u201cnet investment income,\u201d which may include all or a portion of their dividend income and net gains from the disposition of our shares. This tax treatment may be adversely affected, changed or repealed in the future and may affect market perceptions of our Company and the market price of our shares could be negatively affected.\nOur ability to use our NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and analogous state income tax provisions, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation, such as the Company) that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income. Generally speaking, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if the aggregate percentage ownership of the stock of the corporation held by one or more \u201cfive-percent stockholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) increases by more than fifty percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, which is generally the three year-period ending on the transaction date. If we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs and certain other tax attributes could be limited.\nWe have state income tax NOLs, which may not be realized before they expire.\nWe have incurred state NOLs and have provided a valuation allowance against a portion of those. There can be no assurance that we will utilize these state losses or future losses that may be generated. Further, several states have imposed limitations on the ability of NOL carryforwards to offset current year income. There can be no assurance that other states will not suspend or limit the use of NOL carryforwards.\nRecent changes to U.S. tax laws may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and create the risk that we may need to adjust our accounting for these changes.\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act made significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including ours. For instance, by lowering corporate tax rates, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act tends to reduce both the value of deferred tax assets and the amount of deferred tax liabilities. It also limits interest rate deductions and the amount of NOLs that can be used each year and alters the expensing of capital expenditures. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as state tax authorities, and the Tax Cut and Jobs Act could be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase the adverse (and positive) impacts of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. The accounting treatment of these tax law changes is complex, and some of the changes may affect both current and future periods.\nThe treatment of depreciation and other tax deductions under current U.S. federal income tax law may be adversely affected, changed, or repealed in the future.\nUnder current law, certain capital expenditures are eligible for accelerated depreciation, including 100% bonus depreciation for qualifying assets purchased and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and prior to January 1, 2023, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, certain other expenses are eligible to be deducted for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This tax treatment may be adversely affected, changed, or repealed by future changes in tax laws at any time, which may affect market perceptions of our Company and the market price of our shares could be negatively affected.\nOur Company could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and/or changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws.\nWe are subject to various taxing regimes, including federal, state, local and foreign taxes such as income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, property, gross receipts, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof are continuously being enacted or proposed and could result in increased expenditures for tax in the future and could have a material adverse effect on our Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes.\nWe are required to pay real property taxes in respect of our properties and such taxes may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change. An increase in the assessed value of our properties or our property tax rates may not be passed along to our customers and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur Company and our subsidiaries are subject to examinations and challenges by taxing authorities.\nPeriodic examinations or audits by taxing authorities could increase our tax liabilities and result in the imposition of interest and penalties. If challenges arising from such examinations and audits are not resolved in our Company\u2019s favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 90507, "SIC": 4581, "TIC": "MIC"}
