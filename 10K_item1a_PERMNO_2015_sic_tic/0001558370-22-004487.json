{"cik": "1429260", "company": "Fortress Biotech, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Common Stock, Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock or any other type of equity or debt securities (together our \u201cSecurities\u201d) involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as the risks, uncertainties and other information set forth in the reports and other materials filed or furnished by our partners and affiliates Avenue, Checkpoint, Journey and Mustang with the SEC, before deciding to invest in our Securities. If any of the following risks or the risks included in the public filings of Avenue, Checkpoint, Journey or Mustang were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Securities could decline, and you could lose part of or all of your investment in our Securities. In addition, you should be aware that the below stated risks should be read as being applicable to our partners and affiliates such that, if any of the negative outcomes associated with any such risk is experienced by one of our partners or affiliates, the value of Fortress\u2019 holdings in such partner or affiliate (if any) may decline. As used throughout this filing, the words \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d may refer to Fortress individually or together with our affiliates and partners, as dictated by context.\nRisks Inherent in Drug Development\nMost of our or our partner companies\u2019 product candidates are in the early stages of development and may not be successfully developed or commercialized, and the product candidates that do advance into clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval.\nMost of our existing product candidates remain in the early stages of development and will require substantial further capital expenditures, development, testing and regulatory approvals prior to commercialization. The development and regulatory approval processes take several years, and it is unlikely that our product candidates, even if successfully developed and approved by the FDA and/or foreign equivalent regulatory bodies, would be commercially available for several years. Only a small percentage of drugs under development successfully obtain regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to fund development programs, we cannot be sure that any of our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized, which could result in the failure of our business and a loss of your investment.\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risks. Before we may seek regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our products, we will be required to demonstrate, through well-controlled clinical trials, that our product candidates are effective and have a favorable benefit-risk profile for their target indications. Success in early clinical trials is not necessarily indicative of success in later stage clinical trials, during which product candidates may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy, despite having progressed through initial clinical testing, which may cause significant setbacks. Further, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not currently anticipated. As a result, product candidates that we advance into clinical trials may never receive regulatory approval.\nEven if any of our product candidates are approved, regulatory authorities may approve any such product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may place limitations on our ability to commercialize products at the intended price points, may grant approval contingent on the product\u2019s performance in costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a label that does not include the claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. The regulatory authority may also require the label to contain warnings, contraindications, or precautions that limit the commercialization of the product. In addition, the Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d), or foreign equivalent, may schedule one or more of our product candidates under the Controlled Substances Act, or its foreign equivalent, which could impede such product\u2019s commercial viability. Any of these scenarios could impact the commercial prospects for one or more of our current or future product candidates.\nThe extensive regulation to which our product candidates are subject may be costly and time consuming, cause anticipated delays, and/or prevent the receipt of the required approvals for commercialization.\nThe research and clinical development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of any product candidate, including our product candidates, is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market a product candidate until the FDA approves such product candidate\u2019s Biologics License Application (\u201cBLA\u201d) or New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d). The approval process is uncertain, expensive, often spans many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. In addition to significant and expansive clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for product candidates depends on the results of required non-clinical testing, including the characterization of the manufactured components of our product candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our manufacturing processes, testing procedures or equipment and facilities are inadequate to support approval. Further, the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process and may change approval policies or interpretations of regulations at any time, which could delay, limit or preclude a product candidate\u2019s approval.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies may delay, limit or refuse approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf disagreement with the trial design or implementation of our clinical trials, including proper use of clinical trial methods and methods of data analysis;\n\u25cf an inability to establish sufficient data and information to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and/or effective for an indication;\n\u25cf the FDA\u2019s rejection of clinical data from trials conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from that of the United States;\n\u25cf the FDA\u2019s determination that clinical trial results do not meet the statistical significance levels required for approval;\n\u25cf a disagreement by the applicable regulator regarding the interpretation of preclinical study or trial data;\n\u25cf determination by the FDA that our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators contract for clinical supplies or plan to contract for commercial supplies, do not satisfactorily comply with CGMPs; or\n\u25cf a change to the FDA\u2019s approval policies or interpretation of regulations rendering our clinical data, product characteristics, or benefit-risk profile insufficient or unfavorable for approval.\nForeign approval procedures vary by country and may, in addition to the aforementioned risks, involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, rapid drug and biological development during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the safety and efficacy of certain marketed pharmaceuticals and may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nDelays in the commencement of our clinical trials, or suspensions or terminations of such trials, could result in increased costs and/or delay our ability to pursue regulatory approvals.\nThe commencement or resumption of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not necessarily limited to, delays in:\n\u25cf obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u25cf reaching and maintaining agreements on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and trial sites, the terms of which may be subject to extensive negotiation and modification from time to time and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf obtaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u25cf obtaining IRB or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u25cf developing and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis, if required;\n\u25cf adding new clinical sites once a trial has begun;\n\u25cf the death, disability, departure or other change to the principal investigator or other staff overseeing the clinical trial at a given site;\n\u25cf identifying, recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial; or\n\u25cf retaining patients who participate in a clinical trial and replacing those who may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process, personal issues, or other reasons.\nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials will delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval for product candidates. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nIf any of our product candidates causes unacceptable adverse safety events in clinical trials, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such product, preventing us from generating revenue from such products\u2019 sale. Alternatively, even if a product candidate is approved for marketing, future adverse events could lead to the withdrawal of such product from the market.\nSuspensions or delays in the completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs and/or delay or prevent our ability to complete development of that product or generate product revenues.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower than we anticipate due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors. Clinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of product manufactured in accordance with regulatory requirements and on a timely basis. Further, a clinical trial may be modified, suspended or terminated by us, an IRB, an ethics committee or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any clinical trial site with respect to that site, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities, due to a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\u25cf failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u25cf inspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u25cf stopping rules contained in the protocol;\n\u25cf unforeseen safety issues or any determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks; and\n\u25cf lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nRegulatory requirements and guidance may change, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Any such change may require us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs, which may in turn impact a clinical trial\u2019s cost, timing, and likelihood of success. If any clinical trial is delayed, suspended, or terminated, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed, and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer. In addition, many of these factors may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nIf our competitors develop treatments for any of our product candidates\u2019 target indications and those competitor products are approved more quickly, marketed more successfully or demonstrated to be more effective, the commercial opportunity for our product candidates will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical industry at a rapid pace. Any of these developments may render one or more of our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive.\nCompetitors may seek to develop alternative formulations that do not directly infringe on our in-licensed patent rights. The commercial opportunity for one or more of our product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop alternative formulations outside the scope of our in-licensed patents. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n\u25cf capital resources;\n\u25cf development resources, including personnel and technology;\n\u25cf clinical trial experience;\n\u25cf regulatory experience;\n\u25cf expertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing capabilities.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we are able to, or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property or exclusivity rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, safe, useful and/or less costly than ours and may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, in patient registration for clinical trials, and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.\nNegative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of the therapies that underpin many of our product candidates may damage public perception of our product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nIf any of the technologies underpinning our product candidates, including gene therapy, is claimed to be unsafe, such product candidate may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. The success of our gene therapy platforms in particular depends upon physicians who specialize in treating the diseases targeted by our product candidates prescribing treatments involving our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, treatments with which they are already familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. Adverse events in our clinical trials, even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could lead to increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that do obtain approval and/or a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. Concern about environmental spread of our products, whether real or anticipated, may also hinder the commercialization of our products.\nThe FDA limits regulatory approval for our product candidates to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\nAny regulatory approval is limited to the indications for use and related treatment of those specific diseases set forth in the approval for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected.\nWhile physicians may prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s label or that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities (\u201coff label uses\u201d), our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the practice of medicine or behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies regarding the promotion of off-label use.\nIf our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to compliance or enforcement actions, including Warning Letters, by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA laws, regulations and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, request a recall, institute fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, corrective advertising, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business.\nRisks Pertaining to the Need for and Impact of Existing and Additional Financing Activities\nWe have historically financed a significant portion of our growth and operations in part through the assumption of debt. Should an event of default occur under any applicable loan documents, our business would be materially adversely affected. Further, our current credit arrangement with Oaktree Capital restricts our and certain of our partner companies\u2019 abilities to take certain actions.\nAt December 31, 2021, the total amount of debt outstanding, net of the debt discount, was $42.9 million. If we default on our obligations, the holders of our debt may declare the outstanding amounts immediately payable together with accrued interest, and/or take possession of any pledged collateral. If an event of default occurs, we may be unable to cure it within the applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment and we may be unable to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, current or future debt obligations may limit our ability to finance future operations, satisfy capital needs, or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. Such restrictions may also prevent us from engaging in activities that could be beneficial to our business and our stockholders unless we repay the outstanding debt, which may not be desirable or possible.\nOn August 27, 2020, we entered into a $60.0 million senior secured credit agreement with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto (collectively, \u201cOaktree\u201d). The Oaktree credit agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants restricting our and certain of our partner companies\u2019 abilities to take certain actions, especially as pertains indebtedness, liens, investments, affiliate transactions, acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, dividends and other distributions (subject in each case to exceptions). The Oaktree credit agreement also contains financial covenants obligating us to maintain a minimum liquidity amount and a minimum amount of revenue, in both cases subject to exceptions. The breach of any such provisions (even, potentially, in an immaterial manner) could result in an event of default under the Oaktree credit agreement, the announcement and impact of which could have a negative impact on the trading prices of our securities. The restrictions imposed by such provisions may also inhibit our and certain of our partner companies\u2019 ability to enter into certain transactions or arrangements that management otherwise believes would be in our or such partner companies\u2019 best interests, such as dispositions that would result in cash inflows to Fortress and/or our partner companies, or acquisitions or financings that would promote future growth.\nWe have a history of operating losses that is expected to continue, and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses, whether we will be able to sustain current revenues or whether we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe continue to generate operating losses in all periods including losses from operations of approximately $188.5 million and $94.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $547.5 million. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur increasing operating costs and interest expense in the future, and our accumulated deficit will increase significantly as we expand development and clinical trial activities for our product candidates and finance investments in certain of our existing and new partners and affiliates in accordance with our growth strategy. Our losses have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if:\n\u25cf one or more of our development-stage product candidates is approved for commercial sale and we decide to commercialize such product(s) ourselves, due to the need to establish the necessary commercial infrastructure to launch and commercialize this product candidate without substantial delays, including hiring sales and marketing personnel and contracting with third parties for manufacturing, testing, warehousing, distribution, cash collection and related commercial activities;\n\u25cf we are required by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority to perform studies in addition to those currently expected;\n\u25cf there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates;\n\u25cf we execute other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, depending on the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u25cf there are variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs;\n\u25cf we become involved in any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuits; and\n\u25cf there are any regulatory developments affecting our competitors\u2019 product candidates.\nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenue. To date, we have not generated any revenue from our development stage products, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from such development-stage products. Our ability to generate revenue from such development-stage products depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u25cf obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, or any future product candidate that we may license or acquire in the future;\n\u25cf manufacture commercial quantities of one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate, if approved, at acceptable cost levels; and\n\u25cf develop a commercial organization and the supporting infrastructure required to successfully market and sell one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate, if approved.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nTo fund our operations and service our debt securities, which may be deemed to include our Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, we will be required to generate a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock and/or preferred stock to decline.\nPrevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Alternatively, as we have done in the past, we may also elect to refinance certain of our debt, for example, to extend maturities. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we are unable to access the capital markets, whether because of the condition of those capital markets or our own financial condition or reputation within such capital markets, we may be unable to refinance our debt. In addition, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock and/or debt securities to decline.\nRepayment of our indebtedness is dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by Journey and its ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Journey may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries, including Journey, is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.\nOur ability to continue to reduce our indebtedness will depend upon factors including our future operating performance, our ability to access the capital markets to refinance existing debt and prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance of the amount by which we will reduce our debt, if at all. In addition, servicing our debt will result in a reduction in the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including operating costs and capital expenditures that could improve our competitive position and results of operations.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which may force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs, commercialization efforts or planned acquisitions and potentially change our growth strategy.\nOur R&D programs will require substantial additional capital for research, preclinical testing and clinical trials, establishing pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities, and establishing and developing quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales, and administrative capabilities to support these programs. We expect to fund our R&D activities from a combination of cash generated from royalties and milestones from our partners in various past, ongoing, and future collaborations, and through additional equity or debt financings from third parties. These financings could depress the stock prices of our securities. If additional funds are required to support our operations and such funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, we may not be able to develop products, which will adversely impact our growth strategy.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $113.2 million and $61.3 million, respectively. We expect to continue to spend significant amounts on our growth strategy. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will enable us to continue to fund operations in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months from the filing of this 10-K. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and achieve profitability, however, we expect to seek to finance potential cash needs.\nOur ability to obtain additional funding when needed, changes to our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, the acceleration or modification of our planned R&D activities, expenditures, acquisitions and growth strategy, increased expenses or other events may affect our need for additional capital in the future and require us to seek additional funding sooner or on different terms than anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we might have to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs and commercialization efforts and potentially change our growth strategy. The terms of our existing debt arrangements, including that with Oaktree, have and will continue to inhibit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 abilities to raise capital.\nWe may be unable to generate returns for our investors if our partner companies and subsidiaries, several of which have limited or no operating history, have no commercialized revenue generating products, or are not yet profitable, cannot obtain additional third-party financing.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make substantial financial and operational commitments in our subsidiaries, which often have limited or no operating history, no commercialized revenue generating products, and require additional third-party financing to fund product and services development or acquisitions. Our business depends in large part on the ability of one or more of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies to innovate, in-license, develop or acquire successful biopharmaceutical products and/or acquire companies in increasingly competitive and highly regulated markets. If certain of our subsidiaries and/or partner companies do not successfully obtain additional third-party financing to commercialize products, or are not acquired in change-of-control transactions that result in cash distributions, as applicable, the value of our businesses and our ownership stakes in our partner companies may be materially adversely affected.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing common stock (or preferred stock that is convertible into common stock), the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. We have also entered into financing arrangements to raise capital for our subsidiaries under which Fortress common stock is or may be issuable to investors in lieu of cash, upon certain conditions being met; in the event such issuances take place, they will also be dilutive of the stakes of existing stockholders. Any future debt financings may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain financial commitments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions, among other restrictions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing or sublicensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nRisks Pertaining to Our Existing Revenue Stream from Journey Medical Corporation\nFuture revenue based on sales of our dermatology products, especially Qbrexza, Amzeeq, Zilxi, Ximino, Targadox, Accutane, and Exelderm, may be lower than expected or lower than in previous periods.\nThe vast majority of our operating income for the foreseeable future is expected to come from the sale of our dermatology products through our partner company Journey. Any setback that may occur with respect to such products could significantly impair our operating results and/or reduce our revenue and the value of our Securities. Setbacks for such products could include, but are not limited to, issues related to: supply chain, shipping; distribution; demand; manufacturing; product safety; product quality; marketing; government regulation, including but not limited to pricing or reimbursement; licensing and approval; intellectual property rights; competition with existing or new products, including third-party generic competition; product acceptance by physicians, other licensed medical professionals, and patients; and higher than expected total rebates, returns or recalls. Also, the majority of Journey\u2019s sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third party generic competition; the introduction of new competitor products, or increased market share of existing competitor products, could have a significant adverse effect on our operating income.\nWe face challenges as our products face generic competition and/or losses of exclusivity.\nJourney\u2019s products do and may compete with well-established products, both branded and generic, with similar or the same indications. We face increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit applications to FDA seeking to market generic versions of our products. In connection with these applications, the generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation. When patents covering certain of our products (if applicable) expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in USPTO proceedings, if a generic company launches a competing product \u201cat risk,\u201d or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products (if applicable) expires or is otherwise lost, we may face generic competition as a result.\nThe majority of our sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third-party generic competition, the introduction of new competitor products, or an increase in market share of existing competitor products, any of which could have a significant adverse impact on our operating income. Four of our marketed products, Qbrexza, Amzeeq, Zilxi and Ximino, as well as DFD-29, currently have patent protection. Three of our marketed products, Accutane, Targadox, and Exelderm, do not have patent protection or otherwise are not eligible for patent protection.\nAccutane currently competes in the Isotretinoin market with five other AB rated products. Targadox currently competes with one AB rated generic product. Exelderm may face AB rated generic competition in the future.\nGeneric versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care.\nAny disruptions to the capabilities, composition, size or existence of Journey\u2019s field sales force may have a significant adverse impact on our existing revenue stream. Further, our ability to effectively market and sell any future products that we may develop will depend on our ability to establish and maintain sales and marketing capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to market, distribute and sell any such products.\nJourney\u2019s field sales force has been and is expected to continue to be an important contributor to our commercial success. Any disruptions to our relationship with such field sales force or the professional employer organization that employs our field sales force, could materially adversely affect our product sales. We currently rely, and may continue to rely, on professional employer organizations and staffing organizations for the employment of our field sales force.\nThe establishment, development, and/or expansion of a field sales force, either by us or certain of our partners or vendors, or the establishment of a contract field sales force to market any products for which we may have or receive marketing approval is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any such product launch or compromise the successful commercialization of such products. If we are unable to establish and maintain sales and marketing capabilities or any other non-technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any products that may be successfully developed, we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell such products. We may not be able to establish or maintain arrangements with third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf our products are not included in managed care organizations\u2019 formularies or coverage by other organizations, our products\u2019 utilization and market shares may be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn the United States, continued sales and coverage, including formulary inclusion without the need for a prior authorization or step edit therapy, of our products for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment of our currently marketed products or those which we may acquire or develop in the future.\nManaged care organizations and other third-party payors try to negotiate the pricing of medical services and products to control their costs. Managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers typically develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications. Formularies are based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of available products. Due to their lower costs, generic products are often favored. The breadth of the products covered by formularies varies considerably from one managed care organization to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical conditions. Failure to be included in such formularies or to achieve favorable formulary status may negatively impact the utilization and market share of our products. If our products are not included within an adequate number of formularies or adequate reimbursement levels are not provided, or if those policies increasingly favor generic products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nReimbursement for our product and product candidates may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\nWe have obtained approval for some products, and intend to seek approval for other product candidates, to commercialize in both the United States and in countries and territories outside the United States. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign countries, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those countries relating to such products. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and biologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures.\nGovernment authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which pharmaceuticals they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination regarding whether a product is:\n\u25cf a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u25cf safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u25cf appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u25cf cost-effective; and\n\u25cf experimental or investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require that we provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. Additionally, while we may seek approval of our products in combination with each other, there can be no guarantee that we will obtain coverage and reimbursement for any of our products together, or that such reimbursement will incentivize the use of our products in combination with each other as opposed to in combination with other agents which may be priced more favorably to the medical community.\nLegislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare systems of the United States and certain foreign countries could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products by revising the payment methodology for many products reimbursed by Medicare, resulting in lower rates of reimbursement for many types of drugs, and added a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program that involves commercial plans negotiating drug prices for their members. In addition, this law provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this law and future laws could decrease the coverage and price that we will receive for any approved products. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Therefore, any limitations in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in reductions in payments from private payors.\nSince 2003, there have been several other legislative and regulatory changes to the coverage and reimbursement landscape for pharmaceuticals. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d or \u201cACA,\u201d was enacted in 2010 and made significant changes to the United States\u2019 healthcare system. The ACA and any revisions or replacements of that Act, any substitute legislation, and other changes in the law or regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAmong the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are:\n\u25cf an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures, or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biological products apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u25cf an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u25cf expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;\n\u25cf a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u25cf extension of a manufacturer\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u25cf expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 138% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer\u2019s Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u25cf expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Pricing Program;\n\u25cf new requirements under the federal Open Payments program and its implementing regulations;\n\u25cf a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;\n\u25cf a new regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilar biological products, all of which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs; and\n\u25cf a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nThe Supreme Court upheld the ACA in the main challenge to the constitutionality of the law in 2012. Specifically, the Supreme Court held that the individual mandate and corresponding penalty was constitutional because it would be considered a tax by the federal government. The Supreme Court also upheld federal subsidies for purchasers of insurance through federally facilitated exchanges in a decision released in June 2015.\nAt the end of 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which repealed the penalty for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential health coverage as required by the ACA. Following this legislation, Texas and 19 other states filed a lawsuit alleging that the ACA is unconstitutional as the individual mandate was repealed, undermining the legal basis for the Supreme Court\u2019s prior decision. On December 14, 2018, a Texas federal district court judge issued a ruling declaring that the ACA in its entirety is unconstitutional. Upon appeal, the Fifth Circuit upheld the district court\u2019s ruling that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. However, the Fifth Circuit remanded the case back to the district court to conduct a more thorough assessment of the constitutionality of the entire ACA despite the individual mandate being unconstitutional. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on appeal from the Fifth Circuit on March 2, 2020, and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. While this lawsuit has no immediate legal effect on the ACA and its provisions, this lawsuit is ongoing and the outcome may have a significant impact on our business.\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, the \u201cBBA,\u201d which set government spending levels for Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019, revised certain provisions of the ACA. Specifically, beginning in 2019, the BBA increased manufacturer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs in the Medicare Part D coverage gap from 50% to 70%, ultimately increasing the liability for brand drug manufacturers. Further, this mandatory manufacturer discount applied to biosimilars beginning in 2019.\nThe 116th Congress explored legislation intended to address the cost of prescription drugs. Notably, the major committees of jurisdiction in the Senate (Finance Committee, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Judiciary Committee), marked up legislation intended to address various elements of the prescription drug supply chain. Proposals include a significant overhaul of the Medicare Part D benefit design, addressing patent \u201cloopholes\u201d, and efforts to cap the increase in drug prices.\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee approved drug-related legislation intended to increase transparency of drug prices and also curb anti-competitive behavior in the pharmaceutical supply chain. In addition, the House Ways & Means Committee approved legislation intended to improve drug price transparency, including for drug manufacturers to justify certain price increases. The 117th Congress convened on January 3, 2021 and could reintroduce many of the bills targeting drug prices. While we cannot predict what proposals may ultimately become law, the elements under consideration could significantly change the landscape in which the pharmaceutical market operates.\nThe Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) advanced the Lower Health Care Costs Act of 2019. Among other things, the bill is intended to reduce costs in the United States health sector. The bill revises certain requirements to expedite the approval of generics and biosimilars. It also limits prices that pharmacy benefit managers may charge health insurers or enrollees for prescription drugs. Although this bill still needs to pass the full Senate and House of Representatives, it is worth noting the wide-ranging effects it could have on the health care sector.\nOn December 12, 2019, the House of Representatives passed broad legislation (H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act) that would, among other provisions, require HHS to negotiate drug prices and impose price caps and restructure the Medicare Part D benefit, imposing more financial responsibility on certain drug manufacturers. Failure by a manufacturer to reach an agreement with HHS on the negotiated price could result in significant penalties for prescription drug manufacturers. In addition, S. 2543, the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act would also, among other provisions, restructure the Medicare Part D benefit, but it would not authorize direct negotiation by the federal government. While we cannot predict what proposals may ultimately become law, the elements under consideration could significantly change the landscape in which the pharmaceutical market operates.\nThe Trump Administration took several regulatory steps to redirect ACA implementation. The HHS finalized a Medicare hospital payment reduction for Part B drugs acquired through the 340B Drug Pricing Program.\nUnder the Trump Administration, HHS finalized several proposals aimed at lowering drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries and increasing price transparency. For example, the Trump Administration issued an interim final rule on November 27, 2020, implementing a \u201cMost Favored Nation\u201d payment model for Part B drugs that applies international reference pricing to determine reimbursement for certain drugs paid by Medicare Part B. The interim final rule was enjoined by federal courts prior to its implementation date of January 1, 2021, and the lawsuit is ongoing. In addition, HHS, in conjunction with the FDA, finalized four pharmaceutical importation pathways in September 2020: (1) regulations establishing importation of pharmaceuticals from Canada by wholesalers and pharmacists; (2) FDA guidance permitting manufacturers to import their own pharmaceuticals that were originally intended for marketing in other countries; (3) a request for proposals from private sector entities to import prescription drugs for personal use under existing statutory authority; and (4) a request for proposals from private sector entities to reimport insulin under existing statutory authority.\nFurther, on November 11, 2020, the Trump Administration issued a final rule that changes the permissible structure of drug rebates and discounts between drug manufacturers and third-party payors (including pharmacy benefit managers that negotiate drug prices on behalf of such third-party payors). This final rule, often referred to as the \u201cRebate Rule,\u201d could have significant direct and indirect impacts on drug pricing in both government and commercial markets. With respect to price transparency, the Trump Administration promulgated regulations that require hospitals and third-party payors to disclose prices of items and services, which may impact negotiated rates in the commercial market.\nOn January 20, 2021, Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Biden indicated support for several policies aimed at lowering drug prices, including government price negotiation, drug importation, international reference pricing, and price increase controls. The Biden Administration may continue, modify, or repeal many of the drug pricing policies proposed and finalized by the Trump Administration. While we cannot predict which policies the Biden Administration may support and enforce, the policies finalized in the months prior to the beginning of Mr. Biden\u2019s term, if continued, could significantly change the landscape in which the pharmaceutical market operates and significantly impact our ability to effectively market and sell our products.\nThere likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare products and services. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u25cf the demand for any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u25cf our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u25cf our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u25cf the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u25cf the availability of capital.\nIn addition, governments may impose price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability. In January 2020, President Trump signed into law the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade deal into law. As enacted, there are no commitments with respect to biological product intellectual property rights or data protection, which may create an unfavorable environment across these three countries.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the payment that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals, if any, of our product candidate, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing conditions and other requirements.\nRisks Pertaining to our Business Strategy, Structure and Organization\nWe have entered, and will likely in the future enter, into certain collaborations or divestitures which may cause a reduction in our business\u2019 size and scope, market share and opportunities in certain markets, or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories. We have also entered into several arrangements under which we have agreed to contingent dispositions of partner companies and/or their assets. The failure to consummate any such transaction may impair the value of such companies and/or assets, and we may not be able to identify or execute alternative arrangements on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe have entered into and consummated several partnerships and/or contingent sales of our assets and subsidiaries, including an equity investment and contingent acquisition agreement between Caelum and AstraZeneca plc\u2019s Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (which transaction has consummated) and a development funding and contingent asset purchase between Cyprium and Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. Each of these arrangements has been time-consuming and has diverted management\u2019s attention. As a result of these consummated/contingent sales, as with other similar transactions that we may complete, we may experience a reduction in the size or scope of our business, our market share in particular markets, our opportunities with respect to certain markets, products or therapeutic categories or our ability to compete in certain markets and therapeutic categories.\nIn addition, in connection with any transaction involving a (contingent or non-contingent) sale of one of our assets or subsidiaries, we may surrender our ability to realize long-term value from such asset or subsidiary, in the form of foregone royalties, milestone payments, sublicensing revenue or otherwise, in exchange for upfront and/or other payments. In the event, for instance, that a product candidate underpinning any such asset or subsidiary is granted FDA approval for commercialization following the execution of documentation governing the sale by us of such asset or subsidiary, the transferee of such asset or subsidiary may realize tremendous value from commercializing such product, which we would have realized for ourselves had we not executed such sale transaction and been able to achieve applicable approvals independently.\nShould we seek to enter into collaborations or divestitures with respect to other assets or subsidiaries, we may be unable to consummate such arrangements on satisfactory or commercially reasonable terms within our anticipated timelines. In addition, our ability to identify, enter into and/or consummate collaborations and/or divestitures may be limited by competition we face from other companies in pursuing similar transactions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.\nAny collaboration or divestiture we pursue, whether we are able to complete it or not, may be complex, time consuming and expensive, may divert from management\u2019s attention, may have a negative impact on our customer relationships, cause us to incur costs associated with maintaining the business of the targeted collaboration or divestiture during the transaction process and also to incur costs of closing and disposing the affected business or transferring the operations of the business to other facilities. In addition, if such transactions are not completed for any reason, the market price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that such transactions will occur, and a failure to complete such transactions could result in a negative perception by the market of us generally and a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nWe act, and are likely to continue acting, as guarantor and/or indemnitor of the obligations, actions or inactions of certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated companies. We have also entered into, and may again enter into, certain arrangements with our subsidiaries and third parties pursuant to which a substantial number of shares of our common stock may be issued. Depending on the terms of such arrangements, we may be contractually obligated to pay substantial amounts to third parties, or issue a substantially dilutive number of shares of our common stock, based on the actions or inactions of our subsidiaries and/or affiliates, regulatory agencies or other third parties.\nWe act, and are likely to continue acting, as indemnitor of potential losses or liabilities that may be experienced by one or more of our affiliated companies and/or their partners or investors. For instance, under that certain Indemnification Agreement, dated as of November 12, 2018 by and among us, Avenue and InvaGen (the \u201cIndemnification Agreement\u201d), we agreed to indemnify InvaGen and its affiliates for losses they may sustain in connection with inaccuracies that may appear in the representations and warranties that Avenue made to InvaGen in the Avenue Stock Purchase and Merger Agreement of even date therewith, as such representations and warranties were given as of the dates of signing and first closing. The maximum amount of indemnification we may have to provide under the Indemnification Agreement is $35.0 million. If we become obligated to pay all or a portion of such indemnification amounts (regardless of whether or not we are partially reimbursed out of the proceeds of the Merger Transaction), our business and the market value of our common stock and/or debt securities may be materially adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, we have agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to act as guarantor in connection with equity or debt raises by our partner companies, pursuant to which we may become obligated either to pay what could be a significant amount of cash or issue what could be a significant number of shares of Fortress common stock if certain events occur or do not occur, which could lead to a depletion of resources or dilution to our common stock, or both.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire or in-license products and product candidates, and if we are unable to do so, or to integrate acquired products into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by acquiring or in-licensing products, businesses or technologies. Future in-licenses or acquisitions, however, may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\u25cf exposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u25cf disruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;\n\u25cf difficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such acquired or in-licensed technologies in the current economic environment;\n\u25cf incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u25cf higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u25cf increased amortization expenses;\n\u25cf difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u25cf impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u25cf inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. In particular, we may compete with larger biopharmaceutical companies and other competitors in our efforts to establish new collaborations and in-licensing opportunities. These competitors may have access to greater financial resources than us and/or may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts.\nCertain of our officers and directors serve in similar roles at our partners, affiliates, related parties and/or other entities with which we transact business or in which we hold significant minority ownership positions, which could result in conflicts of interests relating to ongoing and future relationships and transactions with these parties.\nWe share directors and/or officers with certain of our partners, and other entities with which we transact business or in which we hold significant minority ownership positions, and such arrangements could create conflicts of interest in the future, including with respect to the allocation of corporate opportunities. While we believe that we have put in place policies and procedures to identify and mitigate such conflicts, and that any existing agreements that may give rise to such conflicts and any such policies or procedures were negotiated at arm\u2019s length in conformity with fiduciary duties, such conflicts of interest may nonetheless arise. The existence and consequences of such potential conflicts could expose us to lost profits, claims by our investors and creditors, and harm to our results of operations.\nCertain of our executives, directors and principal stockholders, whose interests may be adverse to those of our other stockholders, can control our direction and policies.\nCertain of our executive officers, directors and stockholders own nearly or more than 10% of our outstanding common stock and, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially own a significant percentage of our capital stock. If these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to influence our management and affairs and the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any sale, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire. In addition, this concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our common stock by:\n\u25cf delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us;\n\u25cf impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u25cf discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIf we acquire, or enter into joint ventures with or obtain a controlling interest in companies in the future, our operating results and the value of our Securities may be adversely affected, thereby diluting stockholder value, disrupting our business and/or diminishing the value of our holdings in our partner companies.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we might acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or obtain significant ownership stakes in other companies. Acquisitions of, joint ventures with and investments in other companies involve numerous risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\u25cf risk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience;\n\u25cf diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u25cf successfully negotiating a proposed acquisition or investment timely and at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us;\n\u25cf the impact of regulatory reviews on a proposed acquisition or investment;\n\u25cf the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted with respect to the proposed acquisitions or investment;\n\u25cf with respect to an acquisition, difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; and\n\u25cf potential inability to maintain relationships with customers of the companies we may acquire or invest in.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures or other transaction opportunities, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, we might incur higher costs than anticipated, and management resources and attention might be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.\nRussian military action in Europe may impact foreign countries in which certain of our partner companies may have enrolled, or had planned to enroll patients in clinical trials, and any such clinical trials may be delayed or suspended.\nIn February 2022, Russia commenced a military invasion of Ukraine. Russia\u2019s invasion and the ensuing response by Ukraine may disrupt our partner companies\u2019 ability to conduct clinical trials in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia, and potentially other neighboring countries. Although the impact of Russia\u2019s military action is highly unpredictable, certain clinical trial sites may be affected, including those of our partner company Checkpoint in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia. Those clinical trial sites may suspend or terminate trials, and patients could be forced to evacuate or choose to relocate, making them unavailable for initial or further participation in clinical trials. Alternative sites to fully and timely compensate for clinical trial activities in these areas may not be available and our partner companies may need to find other countries to conduct these clinical trials.\nClinical trial interruptions may delay our partner companies\u2019 plans for clinical development and approvals for their product candidates, which could increase their costs and jeopardize their ability to commence product sales and generate revenues, which could adversely affect the value of our investment in our partner companies.\nRisks Pertaining to Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely predominantly on third parties to manufacture the majority of our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies and we expect to continue to rely heavily on such third parties and other contractors to produce commercial supplies of our products. Further, we rely solely on third parties to manufacture Journey\u2019s commercialized products. Such dependence on third-party suppliers could adversely impact our businesses.\nWe depend heavily on third party manufacturers for product supply. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to applicable specifications and FDA regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain FDA approval for those products. Our third-party suppliers will be required to maintain compliance with CGMPs and will be subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies and authorities in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. In the event that the FDA or such other authorities determine that our third-party suppliers have not complied with CGMPs or comparable regulations, the relevant clinical trials could be terminated or subjected to a clinical hold until such time as we are able to obtain appropriate replacement material and/or applicable compliance, and commercial product could be unfit for sale, or if distributed, could be recalled from the market. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, testing, packaging, labeling, storage, or distribution of our products as a result of a failure of the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements or pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates. In addition, several of our currently commercialized products, sold through our partner company Journey, are produced by a single manufacturer, and, although we closely monitor inventory prophylactically, disruptions to such supply arrangements could adversely affect our ability to meet product demand and therefore diminish revenues.\nWe also rely on third-party manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the raw materials and equipment necessary to produce product candidates for anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that are used to manufacture those products. We do not have direct control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our third-party manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials since such agreements are entered into by our third-party manufacturers and their qualified suppliers. Any significant delay in the supply of raw material components related to an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to engage in our own commercial manufacturing of our product candidates, if they received marketing approval, and would likely continue to be heavily dependent upon third-party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply clinical trial materials, as well as our planned dependence on third party manufacturers for any products that may be approved, may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all.\nIn addition, because of the sometimes-limited number of third parties who specialize in the development, manufacture and/or supply of our clinical and preclinical materials, we are often compelled to accept contractual terms that we deem less than desirable, including without limitation as pertains representations and warranties, supply disruptions/failures, covenants and liability/indemnification. Especially as pertains liability and indemnification provisions, because of the frequent disparities in negotiating leverage, we are often compelled to agree to low caps on counterparty liability and/or indemnification language that could result in outsized liability to us in situations where we have zero or relatively little culpability.\nWe rely heavily on third parties for the development and manufacturing of products and product candidates.\nCertain of our partner companies, on whose successes we largely rely, are early-stage biopharmaceutical companies with limited operating histories. To date, we have engaged primarily in intellectual property acquisitions, and evaluative and R&D activities and have not generated any revenues from product sales (except through Journey). We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $547.5 million. We may need to rely on third parties for activities critical to the product candidate development process, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\u25cf identifying and evaluating product candidates;\n\u25cf negotiating, drafting and entering into licensing and other arrangements with product development partners; and\n\u25cf continuing to undertake pre-clinical development and designing and executing clinical trials.\nWe have also not demonstrated the ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our pre-market product candidates, should any of them be approved for marketing. If we were to have any such product candidates approved, the successful commercialization of such products would be dependent on us performing or contracting with third parties for performance, of a variety of critical functions, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\u25cf advising and participating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u25cf formulating and manufacturing products for clinical development programs and commercial sale; and\n\u25cf conducting sales and marketing activities.\nOur operations have been limited to acquiring, developing and securing the proprietary rights for, and undertaking pre-clinical development and clinical trials of, product candidates, both at the Fortress level and via our partner companies. These operations provide a limited basis for our stockholders and prospective investors to assess our ability to develop and commercialize potential product candidates, as well as for you to assess the advisability of investing in our securities.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet agreed-upon deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe rely on third-party contract research organizations and site management organizations to conduct most of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials for our product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, site management organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct some of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials. These CROs, investigators, and other third parties will and do play a significant role in the conduct of our trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators or other third parties upon which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fails to meet expected deadlines or fails to adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. If any of the clinical trial sites terminates for any reason, we may lose follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless the care of those patients is transferred to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisers or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site, or the FDA\u2019s willingness to accept such data, may be jeopardized.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities or potential liability. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (\u201cGLP\u201d) as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices (\u201cGCPs\u201d) for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our clinical research organizations fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may refuse to accept such data, or require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under CGMP in strict conformity to CGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nWe also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party contract research organizations or site management organizations terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative contract research organizations or site management organizations or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional contract research organizations or site management organizations involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new contract research organization or site management organization commences work. As a result, delays could occur, which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our contract research organizations or site management organizations, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future.\nWe rely on clinical and pre-clinical data and results obtained from and by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable.\nAs part of the strategy we implement to mitigate development risk, we seek to develop product candidates with well-studied mechanisms of action, and we intend to utilize biomarkers to assess potential clinical efficacy early in the development process. This strategy necessarily relies upon clinical and pre-clinical data and other results produced or obtained by third parties, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable. If the third-party data and results we rely upon prove to be inaccurate, unreliable or not applicable to our product candidates, we could make inaccurate assumptions and/or conclusions about our product candidates, and our research and development efforts could be compromised or called into question during the review of any marketing applications that we submit.\nCollaborative relationships with third parties could cause us to expend significant resources and/or incur substantial business risk with no assurance of financial return.\nWe anticipate substantial reliance on strategic collaborations for marketing and commercializing our existing product candidates and we may rely even more on strategic collaborations for R&D of other product candidates. We may sell product offerings through strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. If we are unable to establish or manage such strategic collaborations on terms favorable to us in the future, our revenue and drug development may be limited.\nIf we enter into R&D collaborations during the early phases of drug development, success will, in part, depend on the performance of research collaborators. We may not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by research collaborators to activities related to product candidates. Research collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our R&D programs. If any research collaborator fails to commit sufficient resources, the preclinical or clinical development programs related to the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. Also, collaborators may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. Finally, if we fail to make required milestone or royalty payments to collaborators or to observe other obligations in agreements with them, the collaborators may have the right to terminate or stop performance of those agreements.\nEstablishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaboration proposals based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property positions. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of product candidates or the generation of sales revenue. To the extent that we enter into collaborative arrangements, the related product revenues that might follow are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold products. Such collaborators may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on, and such collaborations could be more attractive than the one with us for any future product candidate.\nManagement of our relationships with collaborators will require:\n\u25cf significant time and effort from our management team;\n\u25cf coordination of our marketing and R&D programs with the respective marketing and R&D priorities of our collaborators; and\n\u25cf effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects.\nThe contractual provisions we may be forced to agree upon in services, manufacturing, supply and other agreements may be inordinately one-sided, vis-\u00e0-vis current or historical standard market terms (especially as pertains contractual liability and indemnification paradigms), and as a result we may be subject to liabilities that are not attributable to our own actions or the actions of our personnel.\nThere is a finite number of service providers who can perform the services or produce the materials or product candidates that we need, and we therefore often have a limited number of options in choosing such service providers. The standard market terms in many of the agreements into which we customarily enter with such service providers are subject to evolution over time, often-times in favor of our counterparties. Also, some such agreements are \u201cadhesion contracts\u201d under which our contractual counterparties refuse to entertain any modifications to their template documentation. One area where service providers often have and exert leverage over us is the negotiation of liability language - specifically the application of liability damages \u201ccaps\u201d to certain of such service providers\u2019 indemnification obligations. In any circumstance where we\u2019ve been compelled to agree to such language, it is conceivable that we will be liable to third parties for liabilities in excess of such caps that are attributable to the actions, forbearances and/or culpability of such service providers (and not to those of us and our personnel).\nRisks Pertaining to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes with Licensors Thereof\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for product candidates and their formulations and uses. The patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or our partners will be successful in obtaining patents or what the scope of an issued patent may ultimately be. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n\u25cf patent applications may not result in any patents being issued, or the scope of issued patents may not extend to competitive product candidates and their formulations and uses developed or produced by others;\n\u25cf our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we or our partners do, and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that may limit or interfere with our abilities to make, use, and sell potential product candidates, file new patent applications, or may affect any pending patent applications that we may have;\n\u25cf there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n\u25cf countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing products.\nIn addition, patents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the US Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d), or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our US patent positions. An adverse determination in any such submission, patent office trial, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, render unenforceable, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technologies or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nIn addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Third parties are often responsible for maintaining patent protection for our product candidates, at our and their expense. If that party fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for a product candidate, our abilities to develop and commercialize products may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. Such a failure to properly protect intellectual property rights relating to any of our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect products and/or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders, as well as affect the validity, enforceability, or scope of issued patents.\nWe and our licensors also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect product candidates. Although we have taken steps to protect our and their trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality and non-use agreements with third parties, and proprietary information and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and advisers, third parties may still come upon this same or similar information independently. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may also breach the agreements and may unintentionally or willfully disclose our or our licensors\u2019 proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to identify such breaches or obtain adequate remedies. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our or our licensors\u2019 trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we and our licensors would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our or our licensors\u2019 trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive positions would be harmed.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify any patentable aspects of our research and development output and methodology, and, even if we do, an opportunity to obtain patent protection may have passed. Given the uncertain and time-consuming process of filing patent applications and prosecuting them, it is possible that our product(s) or process(es) originally covered by the scope of the patent application may have changed or been modified, leaving our product(s) or process(es) without patent protection. If our licensors or we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for one or more product candidates or any future product candidate we may license or acquire, third parties may be able to leverage our proprietary information and products without risk of infringement, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability. Moreover, should we enter into other collaborations we may be required to consult with or cede control to collaborators regarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of licensed patents. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the US. The patent situation outside the US is even more uncertain. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the US, and we may fail to seek or obtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than US law does. We might also become involved in derivation proceedings in the event that a third party misappropriates one or more of our inventions and files their own patent application directed to such one or more inventions. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention (or that a third party derived an invention from us) would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our US patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.\nOur pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the US and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the federal courts of the US have taken an increasingly dim view of the patent eligibility of certain subject matter, such as naturally occurring nucleic acid sequences, amino acid sequences and certain methods of utilizing same, which include their detection in a biological sample and diagnostic conclusions arising from their detection.\nSuch subject matter, which had long been a staple of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry to protect their discoveries, is now considered, with few exceptions, ineligible in the first instance for protection under the patent laws of the US. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed and remain enforceable in our patents or in those licensed from a third party.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include changes to transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst inventor-to-file\u201d system and to the way issued patents are challenged. The formation of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board now provides a less burdensome, quicker and less expensive process for challenging issued patents. The PTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first inventor-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nWe also may rely on the regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our biologic product candidates that are successfully developed and approved for commercialization. Although this period in the United States is generally 12 years from the date of marketing approval (depending on the nature of the specific product), there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend laws to significantly shorten this exclusivity period. Once any regulatory period of exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage and the nature of the product, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with our products, which would materially adversely affect our business.\nIf we or our licensors are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability, and the abilities of any of our respective current or future collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products, some of which may be directed at claims that overlap with the subject matter of our or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our product candidates of which we or our licensors are not aware. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or such licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or pending patent applications that we own or licensed, or that we and our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In the event that a third party has also filed a US patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, depending upon the priority dates claimed by the competing parties, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention in the US. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our or any of our licensors\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may have to, among other things:\n\u25cf obtain additional licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf abandon an infringing product candidate or redesign products or processes to avoid infringement, which may demand substantial funds, time and resources and which may result in inferior or less desirable processes and/or products;\n\u25cf pay substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if a court decides that the product or proprietary technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party\u2019s rights;\n\u25cf pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to our product candidates; and/or\n\u25cf defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly regardless of outcome, and which could result in a substantial diversion of financial and management resources.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our or our licensors\u2019 patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against accused infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging invalidity of our or our licensors\u2019 patents or that we infringe their patents; or provoke those parties to petition the PTO to institute inter partes review against the asserted patents, which may lead to a finding that all or some of the claims of the patent are invalid. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensor\u2019s is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our or our licensors\u2019 patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could likewise put pending patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nWe in-license from third parties the intellectual property needed to develop and commercialize products and product candidates. As such, any dispute with the licensors or non-performance of such license agreements may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidates.\nThe patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights underpinning the vast majority of our existing product candidates were in-licensed from third parties. Under the terms of such license agreements, the licensors generally have the right to terminate such agreements in the event of a material breach. The licenses require us to make annual, milestone or other payments prior to commercialization of any product, and our ability to make these payments depends on the ability to generate cash in the future. These license agreements also generally require the use of diligent and reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize product candidates.\nIf there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us or one of our partners, on the one hand, and the respective licensing partner, on the other hand, regarding the rights or obligations under the license agreements, including any conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from a failure to satisfy payment obligations under such agreements, the ability to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate may be adversely affected.\nThe types of disputes that may arise between us and the third parties from whom we license intellectual property include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\u25cf the scope of rights granted under such license agreements and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u25cf the extent to which our technologies and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to such license agreements;\n\u25cf the scope and interpretation of the representations and warranties made to us by our licensors, including those pertaining to the licensors\u2019 right title and interest in the licensed technology and the licensors\u2019 right to grant the licenses contemplated by such agreements;\n\u25cf the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our license agreements and/or collaborative development relationships, and the rights and obligations associated with such sublicensing, including whether or not a given transaction constitutes a sublicense under such license agreement;\n\u25cf the diligence and development obligations under license agreements (which may include specific diligence milestones) and what activities or achievements satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u25cf whether or not the milestones associated with certain milestone payment obligations have been achieved or satisfied;\n\u25cf the applicability or scope of indemnification claims or obligations under such license agreements;\n\u25cf the permissibility and advisability of, and strategy regarding, the pursuit of potential third-party infringers of the intellectual property that is the subject of such license agreements;\n\u25cf the calculation of royalty, milestone, sublicense revenue and other payment obligations under such license agreements;\n\u25cf the extent to which rights, if any, are retained by licensors under such license agreements;\n\u25cf whether or not a material breach has occurred under such license agreements and the extent to which such breach, if deemed to have occurred, is or can be cured within applicable cure periods, if any;\n\u25cf disputes regarding patent filing and prosecution decisions, as well as payment obligations regarding past and ongoing patent expenses;\n\u25cf intellectual property rights resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property (including improvements made to licensed intellectual property) by our and our partners\u2019 licensors and us and our partners; and\n\u25cf the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations or may conflict in such a way that puts us in breach of one or more agreements, which would make us susceptible to lengthy and expensive disputes with one or more of such third-party licensing partners. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Pertaining to the Commercialization of Product Candidates\nIf any of our product candidates are successfully developed but do not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that any such product candidates generate from sales will be limited.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, generally would also be necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products would depend on a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\u25cf the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u25cf the timing of market introduction of such product candidate as well as competitive products;\n\u25cf the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u25cf acceptance by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u25cf the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the safety of product candidates in a broader patient group (i.e., based on actual use);\n\u25cf the availability, cost and benefits of treatment, in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;\n\u25cf changes in regulatory requirements by government authorities for our product candidates;\n\u25cf the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries, including any contradictions, warnings, drug interactions, or other precautions;\n\u25cf changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for our product candidate or future product candidates, which could reduce the marketing impact of any labeling or marketing claims that we could make following FDA approval;\n\u25cf relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of side effects and adverse events;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u25cf unfavorable publicity relating to the product.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products and in turn we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nEven if approved, any product candidates that we may develop and market may be later withdrawn from the market or subject to promotional limitations.\nWe may not be able to obtain the desired labeling claims or scheduling classifications necessary or desirable for the promotion of our marketed products (or our product candidates if approved). We may also be required to undertake post-marketing clinical trials. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory or if adverse events or other safety issues arise after approval while our products are on the market, the FDA or a comparable regulatory authority in another jurisdiction may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us that may be expensive and/or time consuming to complete. In addition, if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be impacted or withdrawn and reformulation of our products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our products and additional marketing applications may be required. Any reformulation or labeling changes may limit the marketability of such products if approved.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for one or more of our product candidates or a future product candidate we may license or acquire and may have to limit their commercialization.\nThe use of one or more of our product candidates and any future product candidate we may license or acquire in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf suspension or termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u25cf decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u25cf initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u25cf impairment of our business reputation;\n\u25cf costs of related litigation;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u25cf loss of revenues;\n\u25cf reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize our product candidate or future product candidates.\nOur partner company Journey acquired an isotretinoin product and began marketing that product under the Accutane\u00ae brand name in Q2 2021. Isotretinoin has a black box warning for use in pregnant women. Isotretinoin also has warnings for side effects related to psychiatric disorders and inflammatory bowel disease, among others. Historically, isotretinoin has been the subject of significant product liability claims, mainly related to irritable bowel disease . Currently, there is no significant isotretinoin product liability litigation. The federal multi-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) court dismissed all remaining federal isotretinoin cases in 2014 after ruling that the warning label on the drug was adequate. The MDL dissolved in 2015, which effectively put an end to federal lawsuits. Cases continued in New Jersey state court until 2017, when the trial court judge dismissed the remaining the isotretinoin product liability cases. Thus, should a product liability claim against Journey be brought related to its isotretinoin product, we have substantial defenses. However, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of any litigation and the Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlement or judgments should such new product liability claims be brought.\nWe will obtain limited product liability insurance coverage for all of our upcoming clinical trials. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. When needed we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, we have entered into various agreements under which we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to product candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the authorized manufacturing facilities, processes and equipment, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing drug or biological products, as well as review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, CGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping, and requirements regarding company presentations and interactions with healthcare professionals. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or subject to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product.\nWe also may be subject to state laws and registration requirements covering the distribution of drug products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u25cf restrictions on product manufacturing, distribution or use;\n\u25cf restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u25cf requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf warning or untitled letters;\n\u25cf recalls or other withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u25cf fines;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n\u25cf product seizure or detentions;\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u25cf adverse publicity.\nIf we or our suppliers, third-party contractors, clinical investigators or collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we or our collaborators may be subject to the actions listed above, including losing marketing approval for products when and if any of them are approved, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product brand names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely impact our business.\nA pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the U.S. or other countries until the relevant governmental authority has completed a rigorous and extensive regulatory review process, including approval of a brand name. Any brand names we intend to use for our product candidates in the U.S. will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the PTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product brand names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product brand name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product brand names, we may be required to adopt an alternative brand name for our product candidates. If we adopt an alternative brand name, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product brand name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Pertaining to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of how government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action taken by the U.S. presidential administration may impact our business and industry. In particular, the former U.S. President took several executive actions, specifically through rulemaking and guidance, which could impact the pharmaceutical business and industry. Shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden announced that his Administration would be freezing a number of the prior Administration\u2019s drug pricing reforms, while others remain subject to both executive orders or regulatory changes issued by the Department of Health and Human Services. A few of the major administrative actions include:\n\u25cf On October 30, 2019, the Trump Administration issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (\u201cANPRM\u201d) entitled, International Pricing Index Model for Medicare Part B Drugs. This ANPRM was intended to solicit feedback on a potential proposal to align United States drug prices in the Medicare Part B program with international prices. It also solicited public feedback on a policy that would allowing private-sector vendors to negotiate prices, take title to drugs, and improve competition for hospital and physician business. Although this is only a notice for a potential rule, it signals the Administration\u2019s desire to regulatorily influence the United States drug pricing system that could adversely affect the industry.\n\u25cf On November 15, 2019, CMS issued a proposed rule entitled, Transparency in Coverage and finalized the Calendar Year (\u201cCY\u201d) 2020 Outpatient Prospective Payment System (\u201cOPPS\u201d) & Ambulatory Surgical Center Price Transparency Requirements for Hospitals to Make Standard Charges Rule. Together the rules would increase price transparency through health plans and in hospitals. The affects may influence consumer purchasing habits in the health care sector as a whole. Although the transparency provisions are not yet in effect and the hospital price transparency requirements are subject to litigation, there could be implications for the industry related to drug pricing if or when it is enacted.\n\u25cf On November 18, 2019, CMS issued a proposed rule entitled, Medicaid Fiscal Accountability Regulation (\u201cMFAR\u201d). The proposed rule would significantly impact states\u2019 ability to finance their Medicaid programs. If finalized, the MFAR could force states to restructure their Medicaid financing that could disincentivize or change state prescription drug purchasing behavior that would adversely impact the industry.\n\u25cf On December 18, 2019, the FDA issued a proposed rule entitled, Importation of Prescription Drugs. The proposed rule would allow the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. If finalized, states or other non-federal government entities would be able to submit importation program proposals to FDA for review and authorization. This proposed rule could also influence pricing practices in the United States.\n\u25cf On January 30, 2020, CMS issued a state waiver option entitled, Health Adult Opportunity (\u201cHAO\u201d). The HAO would allow states to restructure benefits and coverage policies for their Medicaid programs. The HAO will provide states administrative flexibilities in exchange for a capped federal share. The cap on the federal share is commonly referred to as a \u201cblock grant.\u201d Importantly, the HAO allows states to set formularies that align with Essential Health Benefit requirements while still requiring manufacturers to participate in the Medicaid Rebate Program. Depending on utilization of the HAO by states, it could impact the industry - especially if states elect to use a formulary.\n\u25cf On December 2, 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) issued a final rule entitled, Modernizing and Clarifying the Physician Self-Referral Regulations and on the same day the HHS Office of Inspector General finalized a similar rule, entitled Revisions to Safe Harbors Under the Anti-Kickback Statute, and Civil Monetary penalty Rules Regarding Beneficiary Inducements. The rules are an effort to reform regulations dealing with anti-kickback and self-referral laws. These rules allow certain financial arrangements that would otherwise violate anti-kickback and self-referral laws for providers that are participating in value-based payment arrangements. The rule could impact drug purchasing behavior to ensure providers are within their budget and/or restructure existing payment structures between providers and manufacturers.\nAs with any change in the Executive Office, and particularly with respect to changes from a Republican Administration under former President Trump to a Democratic Administration under President Biden, we expect there to be significant changes to existing rules, regulations and policies, the enactment of new Executive Orders and other immediate or iterative political, legislative and administrative changes, affecting the pharmaceutical industry. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States, or based on similar governmental changes in other countries.\nOur current and future relationships with customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the U.S. and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf the federal Open Payments program, which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to \u201cpayments or other transfers of value\u201d made to \u201ccovered recipients,\u201d which include physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, and teaching hospitals) and applicable manufacturers. Applicable group purchasing organizations also are required to report annually to CMS the ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act added to the definition of covered recipient practitioners including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives effective in 2022. Data collection began on August 1, 2013 with requirements for manufacturers to submit reports to CMS by March 31, 2014 and 90 days after the end of each subsequent calendar year. Disclosure of such information was made by CMS on a publicly available website beginning in September 2014; and\n\u25cf analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our businesses.\nAs we continue to execute our growth strategy, we may be subject to further government regulation which could adversely affect our financial results, including without limitation the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nIf we engage in business combinations and other transactions that result in holding minority or non-control investment interests in a number of entities, we may become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). If we do become subject to the Investment Company Act, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs in the future.\nGeneral Risks\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or third parties\u2019 cybersecurity.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, and transmit confidential information, including, but not limited to, information related to our intellectual property and proprietary business information, personal information, and other confidential information. It is critical that we maintain such confidential information in a manner that preserves its confidentiality, availability and integrity. Furthermore, we have outsourced elements of our operations to third party vendors, who each have access to our confidential information, which increases our disclosure risk.\nWe are in the process of implementing our internal security and business continuity measures and developing our information technology infrastructure. Our internal computer systems and those of current and future third parties on which we rely may fail and are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. Our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, third-party software, data center facilities, lab equipment, and connection to the internet, face the risk of breakdown or other damage or interruption from service interruptions, system malfunctions, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, contractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware and other malicious code, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information), each of which could compromise our system infrastructure or lead to the loss, destruction, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, or damage or unauthorized access to, our data or data that is processed or maintained on our behalf, or other assets.\nIf such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. For example, in 2021, our partner company Journey was the victim of a cybersecurity incident that affected its accounts payable function and led to approximately $9.5 million in wire transfers being misdirected to fraudulent accounts. The details of the incident and its origin have been under investigation with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity experts working at the direction of legal counsel. The matter was reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and does not appear to have compromised any personally identifiable information or protected health information. As Journey\u2019s controlling stockholder and supporting partner in back-office functions, Fortress provided Journey with $9.5 million to ensure its accounts payable operations continue to function smoothly. Fortress and Journey may incur additional expenses and losses as a result of this cybersecurity incident, including those related to investigation fees and remediation costs.\nIn addition, the loss or corruption of, or other damage to, clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates or any future drug candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their systems and operations could also have a material adverse effect on our business and lead to regulatory agency actions. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Sophisticated cyber attackers (including foreign adversaries engaged in industrial espionage) are skilled at adapting to existing security technology and developing new methods of gaining access to organizations\u2019 sensitive business data, which could result in the loss of proprietary information, including trade secrets. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, or hostile foreign governments or agencies.\nAny security breach or other event leading to the loss or damage to, or unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, personal information, including personal information regarding clinical trial subjects, contractors, directors, or employees, our intellectual property, proprietary business information, or other confidential or proprietary information, could directly harm our reputation, enable competitors to compete with us more effectively, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Each of the foregoing could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. Notifications and follow-up actions related to a security incident could impact our reputation or cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal and remediation costs, in connection with these measures and otherwise in connection with any actual or suspected security breach. We expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security incidents and otherwise implement our internal security and business continuity measures, and actual, potential, or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. We may face increased costs and find it necessary or appropriate to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived security breach.\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material, and our insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential losses arising from any such disruption in, or failure or security breach of, our systems or third-party systems where information important to our business operations or commercial development is stored or processed. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention. Furthermore, if the information technology systems of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and we may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact Journey\u2019s product revenues, future clinical trials, and as a result, our financial condition and results of operations and other aspects of our business.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes a disease referred to as COVID-19, was first detected in Wuhan, China and has since spread worldwide. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the rapidly spreading COVID-19 outbreak had evolved into a pandemic. In response to the pandemic, many governments around the world are implementing a variety of control measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions and bans, instructions to residents to practice social distancing, quarantine advisories, shelter-in-place orders and required closures of non-essential businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to impact the global economy, disrupt global supply chains, and create significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.\nTo protect the health of our workforce, we asked our office-based employees to work remotely, have restricted domestic and international travel indefinitely, and restricted on-site staff to only those personnel and contractors who perform essential activities that must be conducted on-site. We intend to keep these precautionary measures in effect for the foreseeable future and may need to enact further measures to help minimize the risk of our employees being exposed to COVID-19. Although the impact of a remote working environment to our operations has been minimal, our continued reliance on remote work may negatively impact productivity, including our ability to generate revenues and product demand, prepare regulatory applications, and conduct data analysis, and may disrupt, delay, or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, continued remote working could increase our cybersecurity risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruption. COVID-19 may also compromise the ability of independent contractors who perform consulting services for us to deliver services or deliverables in a satisfactory or timely manner.\nSome factors from the COVID-19 outbreak that may delay or otherwise adversely affect Journey\u2019s product revenues, as well as adversely impact Journey\u2019s business generally, include:\n\u25cf the changes in buying patterns throughout Journey\u2019s supply chain caused by lack of normal access by patients to the healthcare system and concern about the continued supply of medications, which may increase or decrease demand for Journey\u2019s products;\n\u25cf adverse effects on our manufacturing operations, supply chain and distribution systems, which may impact Journey\u2019s ability to produce and distribute products, as well as the ability of third parties to fulfill their obligations to us and could increase our expenses;\n\u25cf the risk of shutdown in countries where Journey relies, or may rely, on CMOs to provide commercial manufacture of our products, clinical batch manufacturing of our product candidates, including DFD-29, clinical trial enrollment, or the procurement of active pharmaceutical ingredients or other manufacturing components for Journey\u2019s products or product candidates, which may cause delays or shortages in Journey\u2019s product supply and/or the timing of any our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the risk that the COVID-19 pandemic may intensify other risks inherent in our business; and\n\u25cf the possibility that third parties on which we rely for certain functions and services, including CMOs, suppliers, distributors, logistics providers, and external business partners, may be adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from COVID-19, which could cause us to experience delays or incur additional costs.\nWe may not be able to hire or retain key officers or employees needed to implement our business strategy and develop products and businesses.\nOur success depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers, financial, scientific, and technical personnel and consultants, and on our ability to attract additional personnel as we continue to implement growth strategies and acquire and invest in companies with varied businesses. During our operating history, many essential responsibilities have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals. However, as we continue to implement our growth strategy, the demands on our key employees will expand, and we will need to recruit additional qualified employees. The competition for such qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of services of certain key personnel, or our inability to attract additional personnel to fill critical positions, could adversely affect our business.\nWe currently depend heavily upon the efforts and abilities of our management team and the management teams of our partners. The loss or unavailability of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results. In addition, we have not obtained, do not own, and are not the beneficiary of key-person life insurance for any of our key personnel. We only maintain a limited amount of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage. There can be no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to cover the costs of the events that may occur, in which case, there could be a substantial impact on our ability to continue operations.\nOur employees, consultants, or third-party partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including but not necessarily limited to noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements or internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants and partners are subject, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, consultants, or third-party partners could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with CGMPs, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, comply with internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants or partners are subject, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee, consultant, or third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation, as well as civil and criminal liability. The precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other civil and/or criminal sanctions.\nWe receive a large amount of proprietary information from potential or existing licensors of intellectual property and potential acquisition target companies, all pursuant to confidentiality agreements. The confidentiality and proprietary invention assignment agreements that we have in place with each of our employees and consultants prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of such information, but such employees or consultants may nonetheless disclose such information through negligence or willful misconduct. Any such unauthorized disclosures could subject us to monetary damages and/or injunctive or equitable relief. The notes, analyses and memoranda that we have generated based on such information are also valuable to our businesses, and the unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of such materials by our employees and consultants could significantly harm our strategic initiatives - especially if such disclosures are made to our competitor companies.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees and/or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their former employers or other clients.\nAs is common in the biopharmaceutical industry, we rely on employees and consultants to assist in the development of product candidates, many of whom were previously employed at, or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims related to whether these individuals have inadvertently or otherwise used, disclosed or misappropriated trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and/or the employees or consultants that are implicated.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nThe stock prices of our securities may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n\u25cf announcements we make regarding our current product candidates, acquisition of potential new product candidates and companies and/or in-licensing through multiple partners/affiliates;\n\u25cf sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;\n\u25cf issuance of debt or other securities;\n\u25cf our delay or failure in initiating or completing pre-clinical or clinical trials or unsatisfactory results of any of these trials;\n\u25cf announcements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product introductions;\n\u25cf developments concerning our licensors and/or product manufacturers;\n\u25cf litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf conditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u25cf governmental regulation and legislation;\n\u25cf unstable regional political and economic conditions;\n\u25cf variations in our anticipated or actual operating results; and\n\u25cf change in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market prices of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, may adversely impact the price of our Common Stock.\nAlmost all of the 107.0 million outstanding shares of our Common Stock, inclusive of outstanding equity awards, as of December 31, 2021, are available for sale in the public market, either pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), or an effective registration statement. In addition, pursuant to our current shelf registration statement on Form S-3, from time to time we may issue and sell shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $17.4 million as of December 31, 2021. Any sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock or our Preferred Stock could cause a drop in the trading price of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nWe may not be able to manage our anticipated growth, which may in turn adversely impact our business.\nWe will need to continue to expend capital on improving our infrastructure to address our anticipated growth. Acquisitions of companies or products could place a strain on our management, and administrative, operational and financial systems. In addition, we may need to hire, train, and manage more employees, focusing on their integration with us and corporate culture. Integration and management issues associated with increased acquisitions may require a disproportionate amount of our management\u2019s time and attention and distract our management from other activities related to running our business.\nA catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities beyond insurance limits or cause us to lose key data, which could cause us to curtail or cease operations.\nWe are vulnerable to damage and/or loss of vital data from natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, power loss, fire, health epidemics and pandemics, floods and similar events, as well as from accidental loss or destruction. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our businesses could be seriously impaired. We have property, liability and business interruption insurance that may not be adequate to cover losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions, and we do not plan to purchase additional insurance to cover such losses due to the cost of obtaining such coverage. Any significant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business, financial condition and prospects.\nAny of the aforementioned circumstances, including without limitation the COVID-19 virus, may also impede our employees\u2019 and consultants\u2019 abilities to provide services in-person and/or in a timely manner; hinder our ability to raise funds to finance our operations on favorable terms or at all; and trigger effectiveness of \u201cforce majeure\u201d clauses under agreements with respect to which we receive goods and services, or under which we are obligated to achieve developmental milestones on certain timeframes. Disputes with third parties over the applicability of such \u201cforce majeure\u201d clauses, or the enforceability of developmental milestones and related extension mechanisms in light of such business interruptions, may arise and may become expensive and time-consuming.\nOur ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\nWe may, from time to time, carry net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) as deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage- point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use all of its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which changes are outside our control. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe, and/or third parties on our behalf, may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations may also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our respective resources, and clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover costs and expenses incurred due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted in connection with the storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe have never paid and currently do not intend to pay cash dividends in the near future, except for the dividend we pay on our Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of gain for our Common Stockholders.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock, or made stock dividends, except for the dividend we pay on shares of our Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our businesses, and retain our stock positions. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying cash or stock dividends. Equally, each of our partners is governed by its own board of directors with individual governance and decision-making regimes and mandates to oversee such entities in accordance with their respective fiduciary duties. As a result, we alone cannot determine the acts that could maximize value to you of such partners in which we maintain ownership positions, such as declaring cash or stock dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be the sole source of gain for our Common Stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our business or the business of our partners.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel, ability to accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business or the business of our partners. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough nonessential FDA employees and stop routine activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf the timing of FDA\u2019s review and approval of new products is delayed, the timing of our or our partners\u2019 development process may be delayed, which could result in delayed milestone revenues and materially harm our operations or business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable disruptions at FDA, namely with respect to diverting FDA\u2019s attention and resources to facilitate vaccine development and ensure rapid review and emergency use authorization of vaccines intended to prevent COVID-19. Back in March, Dr. Janet Woodcock, the Director of FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, temporarily stepped away from her role to focus on the therapeutic aspects of Operation Warp Speed, a major reorganization intended to better align FDA\u2019s activities with the national effort to develop COVID-19 countermeasures. Dr. Woodcock later named Acting Commissioner of FDA on January 20, 2021. These changes to leadership, enhanced focus on COVID-19 countermeasures, and the reorganization and rededication or critical resources, both at FDA and within similar governmental authorities across the world, are likely to impact the ability of new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner.\nWe will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. Also, if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our Securities.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSOX\u201d), as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. These rules impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and appropriate corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel have devoted and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nSOX requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. As a result, we are required to periodically perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of those controls, as required by Section 404 of SOX. These efforts to comply with Section 404 and related regulations have required, and continue to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. While we anticipate maintaining the integrity of our internal controls over financial reporting and all other aspects of Section 404, we cannot be certain that a material weakness will not be identified when we test the effectiveness of our control systems in the future. If a material weakness is identified, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources, costly litigation or a loss of public confidence in our internal controls, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock or other Securities.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers and/or delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u25cf the inability of stockholders to call special meetings\u037e and\n\u25cf the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your ownership of our Securities through an acquisition.", "PERMNO": 13159, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "FBIO"}
