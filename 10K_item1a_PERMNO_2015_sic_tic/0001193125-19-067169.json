{"cik": "95552", "company": "SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements, which may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d)\u201d and Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nOur business routinely encounters and addresses risks and uncertainties. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. Discussion about the important operational risks that our business encounters can also be found in the MD&A section and in the business description in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Annual Report. Below, we have described our present view of the most significant risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently do not consider significant, could also potentially impair our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our reactions to these risks and uncertainties as well as our competitors\u2019 and customers\u2019 reactions will affect our future operating results.\nThe automotive industry is cyclical and volatility in the automotive industry could adversely affect our financial performance.\nSubstantially all our sales are made to the European and U.S. automotive markets. Therefore, our financial performance depends largely on conditions in the European and U.S. automotive industry, which in turn can be affected significantly by broad economic and financial market conditions. Consumer demand for automobiles is subject to considerable volatility as a result of consumer confidence in general economic conditions, levels of employment, prevailing wages, fuel prices and the availability and cost of consumer credit, as well as changing consumer preferences. Demand for aluminum wheels can be further affected by other factors, including pricing and performance comparisons to competitive materials such as steel. Finally, the demand for our products is influenced by shifts of market share between vehicle manufacturers and the specific market penetration of individual vehicle platforms being sold by our customers. Decreases in demand for automobiles in Europe and the United States could adversely affect the valuation of our productive assets, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA limited number of customers represent a large percentage of our sales. The loss of a significant customer or decrease in demand could adversely affect our operating results.\nFord, GM, Toyota, VW Group, together, represented 56 percent in 2018, 60 percent in 2017 and 82 percent of our sales in 2016. Despite the decrease in the combined percentage of our four largest customers in 2018 and 2017, a loss of a significant customer or decrease in demand still remains a risk. Our OEM customers are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. Increasingly global procurement practices, the pace of new vehicle introduction and demand for price reductions may make it more difficult to maintain long-term supply arrangements with our customers, and there are no guarantees that we will be able to negotiate supply arrangements with our customers on terms acceptable to us in the future. The contracts we have entered into with most of our customers provide that we will manufacture wheels for a particular vehicle model, rather than manufacture a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life of the model (usually three to five years), typically are non-exclusive and do not require the purchase by the customer of any minimum number of wheels from us. Therefore, a significant decrease in consumer demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers, or a decision by a manufacturer not to purchase from us, or to discontinue purchasing from us, for a particular model or group of models, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors to gain market share could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors, including delivery, overall customer service, price, quality, technology and available capacity to meet customer demands. Some of our competitors are companies, or divisions or subsidiaries of companies, which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do. We cannot ensure that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these competitors. In particular, our ability to increase manufacturing capacity typically requires significant investments in facilities, equipment and personnel. The majority of our operating facilities are at full or near to full capacity levels which may cause us to incur labor costs at premium rates in order to meet customer requirements, experience increased maintenance expenses or require us to replace our machinery and equipment on an accelerated basis. Furthermore, the nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted new entrants, particularly from low-cost countries. As a result, our sales levels and margins continue to be adversely affected by pricing pressures reflective of significant competition from producers located in low-cost foreign markets, such as China, Morocco, and Turkey. Such competition with lower cost structures poses a significant threat to our ability to compete internationally and domestically. These factors have led to our customers awarding business to foreign competitors in the past, and they may continue to do so in the future. In addition, any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately, develop products that are superior to our products, have the ability to produce\nsimilar products at a lower cost or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Consequently, our products may not be able to compete successfully with competitors\u2019 products.\nWe experience continual pressure to reduce costs.\nThe global vehicle market is highly competitive at the OEM level, which drives continual cost-cutting initiatives by our customers. Customer concentration, relative supplier fragmentation and product commoditization have translated into continual pressure from OEMs to reduce the price of our products. It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as OEMs pursue restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions, our gross margin and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in OEMs\u2019 purchasing policies or payment practices could have an adverse effect on our business. Our OEM customers typically attempt to qualify more than one supplier for the programs we participate on and for programs we may bid on in the future. As such, our OEM customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing or may decrease wheel orders from us. Such actions may result in decreased sales volumes and unit price reductions for the Company, resulting in lower revenues, gross profit, operating income and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement cost-saving measures or achieve expected benefits under our plans to improve operations.\nAs part of our ongoing focus to provide high quality products, we continually analyze our business to further improve our operations and identify cost-cutting measures. We may be unable to successfully identify or implement plans targeting these initiatives, or fail to realize the benefits of the plans we have already implemented, as a result of operational difficulties, a weakening of the economy or other factors. Cost reductions may not fully offset decreases in the prices of our products due to the time required to develop and implement cost reduction initiatives. Additional factors such as inconsistent customer ordering patterns, increasing product complexity and heightened quality standards are making it increasingly more difficult to reduce our costs. It is possible that the costs we incur to implement improvement strategies may negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may be unable to successfully launch new products and/or achieve technological advances.\nIn order to compete effectively in the automotive supply industry, we must be able to launch new products and adopt technology to meet our customers\u2019 demands in a timely manner. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed for new product programs in time for the start of production, or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities. In addition, we cannot ensure that our customers will execute the launch of their new product programs on schedule. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development and customer approvals. For example, we recently completed the construction of a Physical Vapor Deposition (\u201cPVD\u201d) finishing facility. PVD is a wheel coating process that creates a bright chrome-like surface in a more environmentally friendly manner than traditional chrome plating. Various commercial opportunities are being evaluated, while at the same time this facility continues to undergo trial testing to meet customer quality criteria. As a result, existing purchase orders for the PVD process will continue to be satisfied using alternative finishing processes. The global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change. As a result, the success of our business requires us to develop and/or incorporate leading technologies, including PVD and other finishing capabilities such as surface printing, laser etching, and 5-Axis milling. Such technologies are subject to rapid obsolescence and may not be proven feasible on a volume production basis, have a demand with our customers, meet our customer\u2019s specifications or prove profitable to us. Our failure to satisfy any of these criteria with respect to a particular technology could result in our not pursuing the development of that technology, expensing any unamortized investment costs and abandoning or seeking an alternative use for any impacted technology. Our inability to maintain access to these\ntechnologies (either through development or licensing) may adversely affect our ability to compete. If we are unable to successfully develop new technologies, differentiate our products, maintain a low-cost footprint or compete effectively with technology-focused new market entrants, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nInternational trade agreements and our international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries that can affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe manufacture a substantial portion of our products in Mexico, Germany and Poland and we sell our products internationally. Accordingly, unfavorable changes in foreign cost structures, trade protection laws, tariffs on aluminum, regulations and policies affecting trade and investments and social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region, among other factors, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have policies, controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, or agents may violate our policies.\nAs a result of changes to U.S. administrative policy, among other possible changes, there may be (i) changes to existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and its anticipated successor agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d), which is still subject to approval by the United States, Mexico and Canada; (ii) greater restrictions on free trade generally; and (iii) significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly tariffs on products manufactured in Mexico. It remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including China, will or will not do with respect to tariffs, NAFTA, USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in United States social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products, and any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, likely would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCost of manufacturing our products in Mexico, Germany and Poland may be affected by tariffs imposed by the United States, trade protection laws, policies and other regulations affecting trade and investments, social, political, labor, or general economic conditions. Other factors that can affect the business and financial results of our Mexican, German, Polish and U.S. operations include, but are not limited to, changes in cost structures, currency effects of the Mexican Peso, Euro and Polish Zloty, availability and competency of personnel and tax regulations.\nFluctuations in foreign currencies may adversely impact our financial results.\nDue to our operations outside of the United States, we experience exposure to foreign currency gains and losses in the ordinary course of our business. We settle transactions between currencies - i.e., in particular, Mexican Peso to U.S. dollar, Euro to U.S. dollar and Euro to Polish Zloty. To the extent possible, we attempt to match the timing and magnitude of transaction settlements between currencies to create a \u201cnatural hedge.\u201d Based on our current business model and levels of production and sales activity, the net imbalance between currencies depends on specific circumstances. While changes in the terms of the contracts with our customers will create an imbalance between currencies that we hedge with foreign currency forward or option contracts, there can be no assurances that our hedging program will effectively offset the impact of the imbalance between currencies or that the net transaction balance will not change significantly in the future.\nThe foreign currency forward or option contracts we enter into with financial institutions are designed to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed\ntransactions and forecasted future cash flows. We have a program to hedge a portion of our material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 48 months. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There is no guarantee that our hedge program will effectively mitigate our exposures to foreign exchange changes which could have material adverse effects on our cash flows and results of operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the value of our foreign assets as reported in U.S. dollars, and may adversely affect reported earnings and, accordingly, the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same market. In addition, changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. We cannot ensure that fluctuations in exchange rates will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, our total debt was $684.9 million ($664.5 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $20.4 million), and we had availability of $156.6 million under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as well as 30.0 million Euros under a secured European revolving line of credit. The interest expense on indebtedness will remain significantly higher than historical interest expense (in particular, relative to the time prior to the acquisition of the European Operations) and could adversely affect our financial condition.\nSubject to the limits contained in the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.\nIn addition, the Indenture and the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our other debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the maturity of all of our debt.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Notes or our redeemable preferred stock, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations or redeemable preferred stock depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, economic and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, redeemable preferred stock and our other indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, including payments with respect to our redeemable preferred stock, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital and credit markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations and limit our financial flexibility. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness and redeemable preferred stock on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit\nrating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, including (i) redemption of our redeemable preferred stock at a redemption price of $300.0 million (2.0 times stated value) or the product of the number of common shares into which the redeemable preferred stock could be converted (5.3 million shares currently) and the then current market price of our common stock and (ii) the repurchase of the Notes or redemption of the redeemable preferred stock upon a change of control or repurchase of the Notes upon sales of certain assets. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indenture restrict our ability to conduct asset sales and/or use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate these asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due, including payments due with respect to our redeemable preferred stock. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Indenture, and other debt instruments, as well as the documents governing other debt that we may incur in the future may, restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe Indenture, the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and our other debt instruments, and the documents governing other debt that we may incur in the future may, contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments, acquisitions, loans or advances or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, repurchase our capital stock or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem, or repurchase any subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements which limit the ability of our non-guarantor subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us; and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other debt instruments require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests to the extent subject to certain financial covenant conditions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control. We may not meet those ratios and tests.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the Indenture governing the Notes, under the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or under other debt instruments could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors under such facility to accelerate the related debt, which may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable\nunder the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or under other secured debt instruments, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In the event our lenders or holders of the Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms acceptable to us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. These restrictions, along with restrictions that may be contained in agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness, may affect our ability to grow or pursue other important initiatives in accordance with our growth strategy.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $382.8 million of our debt was variable rate debt. Our anticipated annual interest expense on $382.8 million variable rate debt at the current rate of 6.3 percent would be $24.1 million. We have entered into interest rate swaps exchanging floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. As of December 31, 2018, we have executed interest rate swaps for $90.0 million, maturing $25.0 million March 31, 2019, $30.0 million September 30, 2019, and $35.0 million December 31, 2019. In addition, on January 10, 2019 we entered into additional interest rate swaps for $200 million, maturing $50 million September 30, 2022 and $150 million December 31, 2022. In the future, we may again enter into interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nIn addition, the interest rates under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are calculated using LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, a comparable or successor reference rate as approved by the Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement will apply or such other reference rate as may be agreed by the Company and the lenders under the Credit Agreement. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global\nprovision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly subjective. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cThe Act\u201d) was signed into law, effective January 1, 2018. The Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, a one-time transition tax on offshore earnings at reduced tax rates regardless of whether earnings are repatriated, the elimination of U.S. tax on foreign dividends (subject to certain important exceptions), new taxes on certain foreign earnings- Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d), limitations on deductibility of interest expense, immediate deductions for certain new investments and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits.\nIn addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. The impact of tax reform in the United States or other foreign tax law changes could result in an overall tax rate increase to our business.\nIncreases in the costs and restrictions on availability of raw materials could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow.\nGenerally, we obtain our raw materials, supplies and energy requirements from various sources. Although we currently maintain alternative sources, our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery. Fluctuations in the prices of raw materials may be driven by the supply and demand for that commodity or governmental regulation, including trade laws and tariffs. In addition, if any of our suppliers seek bankruptcy relief or otherwise cannot continue their business as anticipated, the availability or price of raw materials could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we are able to periodically pass certain aluminum cost increases on to our customers, we may not be able to pass along all changes in aluminum costs, or there may be a delay in passing the aluminum costs onto our customers. Our customers are not obligated to accept energy or other supply cost increases that we may attempt to pass along to them. This inability to pass on these cost increases to our customers could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow.\nAluminum and alloy pricing may have a material effect on our operating margins and cash flows.\nThe cost of aluminum is a significant component in the overall cost of a wheel and in our selling prices to customers. The price for aluminum we purchase is adjusted based on changes in certain published market indices, but the timing of price adjustments is based on specific customer agreements and can vary from monthly to quarterly. As a result, the timing of aluminum price adjustments with customers flowing through sales rarely will match the timing of such changes in cost and can result in fluctuations to our gross profit. This is especially true during periods of frequent increases or decreases in the market price of aluminum.\nThe aluminum we use to manufacture wheels also contains additional alloy materials, including silicon. The cost of alloying materials is also a component of the overall cost of a wheel. The price of the alloys we purchase is also based on certain published market indices; however, most of our customer agreements do not provide price adjustments for changes in market prices of alloying materials. Increases or decreases in the market prices of these alloying materials could have a material effect on our operating margins and cash flows.\nThere is a risk of discontinuation of the E.U. anti-dumping duty from China which may increase the competitive pressure from Chinese producers, including in the aftermarket.\nIn 2010, the European Commission imposed provisional anti-dumping duties of 22.3 percent on imports of aluminum road wheels from China after a complaint of unfair competition from European manufacturers. The European Commission argued that the EU manufacturers had suffered a significant decrease in production and sales, and a loss of market share, as well as price depression due to cheaper imports from China. On January 23, 2017, the European Commission decided to maintain the anti-dumping duties (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/109) for another five-year period. The anti-dumping duties protect the EU producers until January 24, 2022. After this date, the competitive pressures from Chinese producers, which have cost advantages, primarily in the aftermarket, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws.\nWe incur costs to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot ensure that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. Failure to be in compliance with such laws and regulations could result in material fines or sanctions. Additionally, changes to such laws or regulations may have a significant impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the storage, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes and the health and safety of our employees. The nature of our current and former operations and the history of industrial uses at some of our facilities expose us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental and worker health and safety matters which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, some of our properties are subject to indemnification and/or cleanup obligations of third parties with respect to environmental matters. However, in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of such third parties, we could be required to assume the liabilities that would otherwise be the responsibility of such third parties.\nFurther, changes in legislation or regulation imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, or otherwise impacting or limiting our equipment and operations or from the vehicles that use our products could adversely affect demand for those vehicles or require us to incur costs to become compliant with such regulations.\nWe are from time to time subject to litigation, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to litigation in the ordinary course of our business. We are exposed to potential product liability and warranty risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of automotive products, the failure of which could result in property damage, personal injury or death. Accordingly, individual or class action suits alleging product liability or warranty claims could result. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against future liabilities. In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in any product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur business requires extensive product development activities to launch new products. Accordingly, there is a risk that wheels under development may not be ready by the start of production (\u201cSOP\u201d) or may fail to meet the customer\u2019s specifications. In any such case, warranty or compensation claims might be raised, or litigation might\nbe commenced, against the Company. Moreover, the Company could lose its reputation of an entrepreneur actively developing new and innovative solutions, which in turn could affect the volume of orders, particularly orders for new designs.\nMoreover, there are risks related to civil liability under our customer supply contracts (civil liability clauses in contracts with customers, contractual risks related to civil liability for causing delay in production launch, etc.). If we fail to ensure production launch as and when required by the customer, thus jeopardizing production processes at the customer\u2019s facilities, this could lead to increased costs, giving rise to recourse claims against, or causing loss of orders by the Company. This could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we do not successfully manage the transition associated with the retirement of our former Chief Executive Officer and the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, it could be viewed negatively by our customers and shareholders and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn December 2018, Donald J. Stebbins retired from his position as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Timothy C. McQuay, the Chairman of the Board, is serving as the Executive Chairman. The Board has an active search process underway to select the next Chief Executive Officer from internal and external candidates. If we are unable to attract and retain a qualified candidate to become our Chief Executive Officer in a timely manner, our ability to meet our financial and operational goals and strategic plans, as well as our financial performance, may be adversely impacted. It may also make it more difficult to retain and hire key employees. In addition, such leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and a poorly executed transition involving our new Chief Executive Officer may cause disruption to our business, including to our relationships with customers, vendors and employees.\nLabor-related disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations.\nOur business is labor-intensive. Although we consider our current relations with our employees to be good, if major work disruptions were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be harmed. A labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or our suppliers or our customers\u2019 suppliers, or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and our profitability. A labor dispute involving any of our customers or our customers\u2019 suppliers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers\u2019 assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, operational, engineering, sales and marketing personnel. We face significant competition for these types of employees in our industry. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct our operations successfully. In addition, key personnel may leave us and compete against us. Our success also depends, to a significant extent, on the continued service of our senior management team. We may be unsuccessful in replacing key managers who either resign or retire. The loss of any member of our senior management team or other experienced senior employees could impair our ability to execute our business plans and strategic initiatives, cause us to lose customers and experience reduced net sales, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other key employees.\nA disruption in our information technology systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology systems. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our systems, as well as\nthose of our customers, suppliers and other service providers could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. These types of incidents have become more prevalent and pervasive across industries, including in our industry, and are expected to continue in the future. A breach could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel information. Although cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our information technology systems from attack, damage or unauthorized access are a high priority for us, our activities and investment may not be deployed quickly enough or successfully protect our systems against all vulnerabilities, including technologies developed to bypass our security measures. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose access credentials or other sensitive information in order to gain access to our secure systems and networks. There are no assurances that our actions and investments to improve the maturity of our systems, processes and risk management framework or remediate vulnerabilities will be sufficient or completed quickly enough to prevent or limit the impact of any cyber intrusion. Moreover, because the techniques used to gain access to or sabotage systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate the methods necessary to defend against these types of attacks and we cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe are also dependent on security measures that some of our third-party customers, suppliers and other service providers take to protect their own systems and infrastructures. Some of these third parties store or have access to certain of our sensitive data, as well as confidential information about their own operations, and as such are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. Any security breach of any of these third-parties\u2019 systems could result in unauthorized access to our information technology systems, cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nCompetitors could copy our products or technologies and we could violate protected intellectual property rights or trade secrets of our competitors or other third parties.\nWe register business-related intellectual property rights, such as industrial designs and trademarks, hold licenses and other agreements covering the use of intellectual property rights, and have taken steps to ensure that our trade secrets and technological know-how remain confidential. Nevertheless, there is a risk that third parties would attempt to copy, in full or in part, our products, technologies or industrial designs, or to obtain unauthorized access and use of Company secrets, technological know-how or other protected intellectual property rights. Also, other companies could successfully develop technologies, products or industrial designs similar to ours, and thus potentially compete with us.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that we will not unknowingly infringe intellectual property rights of our competitors, such as patents and industrial designs, especially due to the fact that the interpretations of what constitutes protected intellectual property may differ. Similarly, there is a risk that we will illegitimately use intellectual property developed by our employees, which is subject in each case to relevant regulations governing employee-created innovations. If a dispute concerning intellectual property rights arises, in which the relevant court issues an opinion on the disputed intellectual property rights contrary to us, identifying a breach of intellectual property rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages or to stop the use of such intellectual property. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of injunctions being imposed to prevent further infringement, leading to a decrease in the number of customer orders.\nAll these events could have a material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully achieve expected benefits from our joint ventures or acquisitions.\nAs we continue to expand globally, we have engaged, and may continue to engage, in joint ventures and have pursued, and may continue to pursue, acquisitions, including our acquisition of Uniwheels (now referred to as our \u201cEurope segment,\u201d \u201cEurope business\u201d or \u201cEurope operations\u201d) in May 2017. The pursuit of potential joint ventures and/or acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable joint ventures and/or acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. Such joint ventures and acquisitions involve potential risks, including failure to successfully integrate and/or realize the expected benefits of such joint ventures or acquisitions. Integrating acquired operations is a significant challenge, and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage any future integrations successfully. Failure to successfully integrate operations or to realize the expected benefits of such joint ventures or acquisitions may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may fail to comply with conditions of the state tax incentive programs in Poland.\nWe have three production plants in a special Poland economic zone, Tanobrzeska Specjalna Strefa Ekonomiczna Euro-Park Wislosan in Stalowa Wola, Poland. Our Polish operations were granted seven permits to operate in this special economic zone, which allows us to benefit from Polish state tax incentives. The permits require certain conditions to be met, which include increasing the number of employees, keeping the number of employees at such level and incurring required capital expenditures. In addition, particular permits indicate deadlines for completion of respective stages of investments. For three of the seven permits, conditions have already been fulfilled. As of December 31, 2018, the tax subsidies are limited to 2018 (for three permits) and 2027 (for four permits). If we do not fulfill the conditions required by the permits, the permits might be withdrawn and we would no longer benefit from state tax incentives, which may impact our assets, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in a material way. Furthermore, under current Polish regulations, special economic zones are scheduled to cease to exist in 2027.\nWe are currently unable to fully deduct interest charges on German indebtedness.\nThe interest deduction barrier (Zinsschranke) limits the tax deductibility of interest expenses for a German business. If no exception to the interest deduction barrier applies, the net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) is deductible up to 30 percent of the taxable EBITDA (verrechenbares EBITDA) taxable in Germany in a given financial year. Non-deductible interest expenses can be carried forward. Interest carry-forwards are subject to the same tax cancellation rules as tax loss carry-forwards. Whenever interest expenses are not deductible or if an interest carry-forward is lost, the tax burden in future assessment periods could rise, which might have alone, or in combination, a material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\nWe may be exposed to risks related to existing and future profit and loss transfer agreements executed with German subsidiaries of our European Operations.\nProfit and loss transfer agreements are one of the prerequisites of the taxation of Superior and its German subsidiaries as a German tax group. For tax purposes, a profit and loss transfer agreement must have a contract term for a minimum of five years. In addition, such agreement must be fully executed. If a profit and loss transfer agreement or its actual execution does not meet the prerequisites for the taxation as a German tax group, Superior Industries International AG (\u201cSII AG\u201d) and each subsidiary are taxed on their own income (and under certain circumstances even with retrospective effect). Additionally, 5 percent of dividends from the subsidiary to SII AG would be regarded as non-deductible expenses at the SII AG level. Furthermore, the compensation of a loss of a subsidiary would be regarded as a contribution by SII AG into the subsidiary and thus, would not directly reduce SII AG\u2019s profits. As a consequence, if the profit and loss transfer agreements do not meet the prerequisites of a German tax group, this could have a future material adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPurchase of additional shares of Uniwheels may require a higher purchase price.\nSuperior executed a Domination and Profit Loss Transfer Agreement, \u201cDPLTA\u201d, which became effective in January 2018. According to the terms of the DPLTA, SII AG offered to purchase any outstanding shares for cash consideration of Euro 62.18, or approximately Polish Zloty 264 per share. The cash consideration paid to shareholders, which tendered under the DPLTA may be subject to change based on appraisal proceedings that the minority shareholders of Uniwheels have initiated.", "PERMNO": 52396, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "SUP"}
