{"cik": "1646228", "company": "At Home Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nGeneral economic factors may materially adversely affect our business, revenue and profitability.\nGeneral conditions in the United States and global economy that are beyond our control may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending for home d\u00e9cor products, our customers may allocate less money for discretionary purchases as a result of increased levels of unemployment, reduced consumer disposable income, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, foreclosures, bankruptcies, falling real estate and asset prices, reduced availability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, a decline in consumer confidence, inflation, deflation, recession, an overall economic slowdown and other factors that influence consumer spending. The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty in the global economy that has resulted in an unprecedented sharp economic downturn, which has adversely affected our business, revenues and profitability in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Our actual results for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 remain subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to uncertainty surrounding the continued duration of the COVID-19 crisis and the public policy response. As a result, the full effect that the outbreak of COVID-19 may have on our financial performance cannot be quantified at this time, and discretionary spending on home d\u00e9cor items could contract in the future. Accordingly, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future performance, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our costs and expenses could be materially adversely impacted by general economic factors such as higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, higher transportation costs, higher commodity costs, higher costs of labor, tariffs, supply chain disruption or other trade restrictions, insurance and healthcare, increased rental expense, inflation in other costs, higher tax rates and other changes in the tax law and changes in other laws and regulations. The economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of merchandise we sell to our customers.\nOutbreaks of communicable disease, or other public health emergencies, such as the current global COVID-19 pandemic, has substantially impacted and will continue to negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions to the global economy, and has been substantially impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFollowing government mandates in certain locations as well as increasing advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for persons in the United States to take extraordinary health precautions, on March 20, 2020 we announced that we would temporarily close all of our stores nationwide for one week, after which we began to reopen stores in regions that were not required to remain closed by state or local mandates. Approximately 80% of our stores are fully open to foot traffic, and fewer than 10 stores remain closed to both foot traffic and curbside pickup, as of the filing of this report. At this time, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting store closures have caused a decline in revenue and cash flow from operations, adverse effects on store traffic, supply chain disruption, and has resulted in incremental costs which have disrupted our operations and adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition in fiscal year 2021. While we have plans for fully reopening our remaining stores in the future, these plans depend on a number of factors, including applicable regulatory restrictions, and there is substantial uncertainty regarding the manner and timing in which we can return some or all of our business to more normal operations.\nThe temporary closure of our stores and decline in store traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significantly declined cash flows from operations. There can be no assurance that we will not be required by landlords or authorities at the local, state or federal level to reinstate or extend store closures, or as to how long any such closure would continue. In general, during any such closure, we would still be obligated to make payments to landlords and for routine operating costs, such as utilities and insurance. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash flows from operations or other sources of liquidity to continue making such payments when due, or that efforts to reduce, offset or defer such obligations, such as entering into deferral agreements with landlords or other creditors, will be successful. On March 12, 2020, as a precautionary measure to provide more financial flexibility and maintain liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we elected to borrow an additional $55 million under our asset-based revolving line of credit (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d), as described in Note 5 - Revolving Line of Credit, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in \u201cItem 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules\u201d. Additionally, we are seeking to amend our ABL Facility to provide for further incremental borrowings but there is no assurance that we will be successful in borrowing such incremental funds and such additional borrowings may lead to fees, increased interest rates and interest expense, and additional restrictive covenants and other lender protections.\nOur customers may also be negatively affected by layoffs, work reductions or financial hardship as a result of the global outbreak of COVID-19, which could negatively impact demand for our products as customers delay or reduce discretionary purchases. Even once we are able to fully reopen our stores, health concerns could continue and could cause employees or customers to avoid gathering in public places, which could have an adverse effect on store traffic or the ability to adequately staff our stores. Any significant reduction in customer visits to, and spending at, our stores caused directly or indirectly by COVID-19 would continue to result in a loss of revenue and profits and could result in other material adverse effects.\nThe negative impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 could result in an adverse impact to manufacturing activity and supply chains, including as a result of work stoppages, factory and other business closings, slowdowns or delays, or if we fail to make timely payments to our suppliers. In addition, there may be restrictions and limitations placed on workers and factories, including shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders and other limitations on the ability to travel and return to work, which could result in shortages or delays in production or shipment of products.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the United States and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. While we continue to explore all options for preserving and increasing sources of liquidity, such as potential increases in our existing financing facilities or entry into new facilities, expense reduction initiatives, and negotiation with counterparties such as landlords and suppliers to extend or otherwise revise payment terms, we do not expect that such efforts will fully offset the adverse impact on us of a prolonged disruption to our business. The ultimate extent to which the outbreak of COVID-19 may impact our business is uncertain and the full effect it may have on our financial performance cannot be quantified at this time. Accordingly, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future performance, financial condition and results of operations.\nVolatility or disruption in the financial markets could materially adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe rely on stable and efficient financial markets. Any disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. Volatility in the financial markets could also result in difficulties for financial institutions and other parties that we do business with, which could potentially affect our ability to access financing under our existing arrangements. The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused extreme volatility in global financial markets, resulting in emergency actions by governmental authorities and central banks to maintain access to financing. There can be no assurance that these actions will be successful or that markets will not continue to experience unusual levels of volatility.\nWe are exposed to the impact of any global or domestic economic disruption. Although we have historically generated sufficient funds from our operations and our existing credit facilities to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures, our ability to continue to meet these cash requirements, particularly in light of the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the temporary closure of a significant portion of our stores, approximately 20% of which are open only for curbside pickup and/or delivery as of the filing of this report, we have taken actions to increase our liquidity as a precaution and may require access to additional sources of funds, including equity and debt capital markets. Continued market volatility and adverse trends in general economic conditions would adversely affect our ability to access financial markets.\nIn addition, the inability of our vendors to access capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventory, production levels and product quality and to operate their businesses, or the insolvency of our vendors, could lead to their failure to deliver merchandise. If we are unable to purchase products when needed, our sales could be materially adversely impacted. Accordingly, volatility or disruption in the financial markets could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy and could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nConsumer spending on home d\u00e9cor products could decrease or be displaced by spending on other activities as driven by a number of factors.\nConsumer spending on home d\u00e9cor products could decrease or be displaced by spending on other activities as driven by a number of factors including:\n\u25cf shifts in behavior away from home decorating in favor of other products or activities, such as fashion, media or electronics;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and other factors that affect consumer discretionary spending, including epidemic or pandemic disease, government shutdowns and declines in financial market performance and asset prices;\n\u25cf natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, heavy snow, ice or rain storms, which disrupt the ability of consumers to continue spending on home d\u00e9cor products;\n\u25cf the outbreak of pandemic disease, which has resulted and could in the future result, in shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, store closures and changing consumer preferences with respect to visiting store locations;\n\u25cf man-made disasters, such as terrorism or war, as well as other national and international security concerns; and\n\u25cf other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.\nTotal consumer spending may not continue to increase at historical rates due to slowed population growth and shifts in population demographics, and it may not increase in certain product markets given changes in consumer interests. Further, as we expand into new markets, we may not accurately predict consumer preferences in that market, which could result in lower than expected sales. If consumer spending on home d\u00e9cor products decline, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy on a timely basis or at all, which could harm our growth and results of operations.\nOur growth is dependent on our ability to open profitable new stores. Our ability to increase the number of our stores will depend in part on the availability of existing big box retail stores or store sites that meet our specifications. We may face competition from other retailers for suitable locations and we may also face difficulties in negotiating leases on acceptable terms. We may also face difficulties in sourcing locations that do not give rise to competition between our stores within the same or adjacent geographic markets. In addition, a lack of available financing on terms acceptable to real estate developers or a tightening credit market may adversely affect the retail sites available to us. Rising real estate costs and acquisition, construction and development costs and available lease financing could also inhibit our ability to open or acquire new stores.\nOpening or acquiring stores involves certain risks, including constructing, furnishing, supplying and staffing a store in a timely and cost-effective manner and accurately assessing the demographic or retail environment for a particular location, as well as addressing any environmental issues related to such locations. We cannot predict whether new stores will be successful. Our future sales at new stores may not meet our expectations, which could adversely impact our return on investment. For example, the costs of opening and operating new stores may offset the increased sales generated by the additional stores. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our new stores will generate sales levels necessary to achieve store-level profitability or profitability comparable to that of existing stores. New stores also may face greater competition and have lower anticipated sales volumes relative to previously opened stores during their comparable years of operation. In addition, a significant portion of our management\u2019s time and energy may be consumed with issues related to store expansion and we may be unable to hire a sufficient number of qualified store personnel or successfully integrate the new stores into our business. Furthermore, our vendors may be unable to meet the increased demand of additional stores in a timely manner. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain and distribute adequate merchandise to new stores or maintain adequate warehousing and distribution capability at acceptable costs.\nIn addition, our expansion in existing and new markets may present competitive, distribution, merchandising and regulatory challenges that differ from our current challenges, including competition among our stores, diminished novelty of our store design and concept, added strain on our distribution centers, additional information to be processed by our information technology systems and diversion of management attention from operations. Expansion of our store base in existing markets could lead to competition among our stores, which can impact comparable store sales. New stores in new markets, where we are less familiar with the population and are less well-known, may face different or additional risks and increased costs compared to stores operating in existing markets or new stores in existing markets. For example, we may need to increase marketing and advertising expenditures in new or smaller markets in which we have less store density. Additionally, we may not accurately predict consumer preferences in new markets, which could result in lower than expected sales. Expansion into new markets could also bring us into direct competition with retailers with whom we have no past experience as direct competitors. To the extent that we are not able to meet these new challenges, our sales could decrease and our operating costs could increase. Furthermore, our margins may be impacted in periods in which incremental expenses are incurred as a result of new store openings. Additionally, although we\nbelieve our two distribution centers in Plano, Texas and Carlisle, Pennsylvania, should collectively be able to support more than 350 stores, any unanticipated failure of or inability to support our growing store base could have a material adverse effect on our business. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in opening, acquiring or operating any new stores on a profitable basis.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve our planned growth or, even if we are able to grow our store base as planned, that any new stores will perform as planned. If we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, we will not be able to sustain the growth in sales and profits that we expect, which would likely have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we suspended all new store openings and remodeling projects in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with the exception of seven stores that were at or near completion at the time of the outbreak. While the ultimate duration and impact of this suspension is unknown, it could have a material adverse effect on the execution of our growth strategy and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to manage our inventory effectively and inability to satisfy changing consumer demands and preferences could materially adversely impact our operations.\nDue to the nature of our business, we make decisions regarding merchandise several months in advance of each of the seasons in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly with respect to our merchandise that is manufactured, purchased and imported from countries around the world. We must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully. However, if we misjudge consumer preferences or demands, we could have excess inventory that may need to be held for a long period of time, written down or discarded in order to clear excess inventory, especially seasonal and holiday merchandise. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand, we may not be able to provide certain products in a timely manner to our customers in order to meet their demand, which can result in lost sales. Either event could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if our inventory planning and allocation system is unsuccessful, including the additional processing requirements attributable to our second distribution center, our ability to properly allocate inventory to stores could be adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offer assortments of products that appeal to our customers or that we will satisfy changing consumer demands and preferences in the future. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if:\n\u25cf we miscalculate either the market for the merchandise in our stores or our customers\u2019 purchasing habits;\n\u25cf consumer demand unexpectedly shifts away from the merchandise we offer or if there are unanticipated shifts in consumer preferences in some seasons; or\n\u25cf we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer demands or emerging trends, including shifts in the popularity of certain products or increased consumer demand for more enhanced customer service and assistance, home delivery or online sales and services.\nIn addition, inventory shrinkage (inventory theft, loss or damage) rates could negatively impact our financial results. Furthermore, failure to control merchandise returns could also adversely affect our business. We have established a provision for estimated merchandise returns based upon historical experience and other known factors. However, if actual returns are greater than those projected by management, additional reductions of revenue could be recorded in the future. In addition, to the extent that returned merchandise is damaged or otherwise not appealing to our customers, we may not receive full retail value from the resale or liquidation of the returned merchandise.\nOur business model currently relies on purchasing all inventory centrally through our home office in Plano, Texas. At this office, all product samples are developed and/or received and reviewed; in addition, all purchase orders are placed, fulfilled and allocated from the same location. Major catastrophic events such as natural disasters, epidemic disease (such as the global COVID-19 pandemic), localized labor issues or wages increases, fire or flooding, malfunction\nor disruption of the information systems, a disruption in communication services, power outages, forced closures or shipping interruptions could delay or otherwise adversely affect inventory purchasing or allocation, as well as the ultimate distribution of inventory to our stores and customers. Such disruptions could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations. Our business model of central purchasing could also fail to account for differences in consumer preferences by market. In such cases, and where our focus of providing the broadest assortment of products for any room similarly did not account for differences in consumer preferences by market, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur manufacturing and transportation supply chains may be subject to the impact of global pandemics, such as COVID-19. We may be impacted by factory closures, port closures and the inability of our vendors to produce and ship products. In addition, our supply chain may be subject to financial risks as raw material producers and manufacturers experience financial hardships, closures or the inability to attract a labor force. While production of certain of our product categories is concentrated in localized regions that are subject to the COVID-19 pandemic, our broader production base is diversified across regions with opportunities to make strategic shifts as business conditions allow.\nThe loss of, or disruption in, or our inability to efficiently operate our distribution network could have a materially adverse impact on our business.\nWe operate cross dock distribution centers in Plano, Texas and Carlisle, Pennsylvania, as well as warehouse premises in Garland, Texas. The majority of our inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our distribution centers where the inventory is processed and then shipped to our stores. Only mattresses and some food items are shipped directly to stores. We rely in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends on our automated distribution system, adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of our distribution network. If complications arise with our distribution facilities or if the facilities or warehouse premises (or a significant portion of inventory located there) is severely damaged or destroyed, our ability to receive and deliver inventory on a timely basis will be significantly impaired. There can be no assurance that disruptions in operations due to natural or man-made disasters, epidemic disease, fire, flooding, terrorism or other catastrophic events, system failure, labor disagreements or shipping problems will not result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores. For example, the global COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to result in disruption in the supply of products to our stores during any period in which either of our distribution centers is closed or if employees at our distribution centers are unable to work due to the outbreak or government response thereto.\nSuch delays could materially adversely impact our business. In addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing merchandise to our stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace our distribution centers. Moreover, our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to cover or compensate us for any losses that may occur. We opened our second distribution center in early fiscal year 2020 and we believe that our two distribution centers in Plano, Texas and Carlisle, Pennsylvania, should collectively be able to support more than 350 stores. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be any delay in fully utilizing the new distribution center or that there will not be any delays or issues in shipping schedules, logistics or systems.\nWe rely upon various means of transportation through third parties, including shipments by air, sea, rail and truck, to deliver products to our distribution centers from vendors and from our distribution centers to our stores, as well as for direct shipments from vendors to stores. Labor shortages or capacity constraints in the transportation industry, disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure, fuel shortages or transportation cost increases (such as increases in fuel costs or port fees) could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, particularly as we receive and deliver our seasonal and holiday merchandise.\nWe are subject to a number of risks because we import a significant portion of our merchandise.\nApproximately 65% of our merchandise was purchased from vendors in foreign countries such as China, Vietnam, India, Turkey and Hong Kong during fiscal year 2020. In addition, many of our domestic vendors purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources. For example, we purchase merchandise from domestic vendors that is imported from China or that is manufactured in China and assembled in the United States. Currently, we do not employ any resources on the ground in Asia to manage our procurement process and various vendor relationships. Instead, we often rely on trading companies to handle sourcing and logistics with Asian factories.\nSubstantial regulatory uncertainty exists regarding international trade and trade policy, both in the United States and abroad. For example, the United States introduced multiple tranches of tariffs on certain goods imported from China. The United States has, at various times, called for the possible implementation of a border tax and has also raised the possibility of other initiatives that may affect importation of goods including renegotiation of trade agreements with other countries and the possible introduction of further import duties or tariffs. Some of our merchandise is included on the lists of products issued by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and may be impacted by tariffs to the extent that such merchandise is sourced from China. In addition, President Trump removed India and Turkey from the Generalized System of Preferences, a U.S. program that allows developing countries to export a range of products to the United States duty-free, effective June 5, 2019 and May 17, 2019, respectively. Some of our merchandise may be impacted by this change to the extent that it is sourced from India or Turkey. Such tariffs, and the possible implementation of a border tax or additional tariffs, as well as any potential retaliatory trade restrictions implemented by other countries, could materially increase our cost of goods sold with respect to merchandise that we purchase from vendors who manufacture products in China or other countries outside the United States or cause potential delays in products received from our vendors. Such adverse results could in turn require us to increase our prices or find alternative vendors in unaffected countries and, in the event consumer demand declines as a result, negatively impact our financial performance. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may be better positioned than us to withstand or react to border taxes, tariffs or other restrictions on global trade and as a result we may lose market share to such competitors. Due to broad uncertainty regarding the timing, content and extent of any regulatory changes in the U.S. or abroad, we cannot predict the impact, if any, that these changes could have to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to fully or substantially mitigate the impact of such tariffs, pass price increases on to our customers or secure adequate alternative sources of products.\nOn October 1, 2018, the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to a new trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, now known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d). After congressional approval, the USMCA was signed into law on January 29, 2020. The USMCA has been ratified by all three nations and is expected to enter into force on July 1, 2020. The full impact of the USMCA on us, our customers and on the economic conditions in our markets is currently unknown.\nForeign sourcing subjects us to a number of risks generally associated with doing business abroad such as the following:\n\u25cf long lead times;\n\u25cf work stoppages and strikes;\n\u25cf delays in shipment, shipping port and ocean carrier constraints;\n\u25cf freight cost increases;\n\u25cf product quality issues;\n\u25cf raw material shortages and factory consolidations;\n\u25cf employee rights issues and other social concerns;\n\u25cf epidemics, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, and natural disasters;\n\u25cf political instability, international conflicts, war, threats of war, terrorist acts or threats, especially threats to foreign and U.S. ports and piracy;\n\u25cf economic conditions, including inflation;\n\u25cf the imposition of tariffs, duties, quotas, taxes, import and export controls and other trade restrictions;\n\u25cf governmental policies and regulations; and\n\u25cf the status of trade relations with foreign countries, including the loss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d status with the United States for a particular foreign country.\nAdverse events could have a greater impact on us than if our operations were in more dispersed geographical regions.\nWe currently operate 212 stores in 39 states, primarily in the South Central, Southeastern, Eastern and Midwestern regions of the United States, including 37 stores in Texas. In addition, we operate a distribution center and warehouse premises in Texas, which services a majority of our stores, and a second distribution center in Pennsylvania. Accordingly, the effect on us of adverse events in these regions, especially in Texas, such as weather (including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, heavy snow, ice or rain storms), natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events, terrorism, blackouts, widespread illness (such as the global COVID-19 pandemic) or unfavorable regional economic conditions, may be greater than if our operations or inventory were more geographically dispersed throughout the country or abroad. Such events could result in physical damage to or destruction or disruption of one or more of our properties, physical damage to or destruction of our inventory, the closure of one or more stores, the lack of an adequate workforce in parts or all of our operations, supply chain disruptions, data and communications disruptions and the inability of our customers to shop in our stores.\nIn addition, increases in our selling, general and administrative expenses due to overhead costs could affect our profitability more negatively than if we had a larger store base. One or more unsuccessful new stores, or a decline in sales or profitability at an existing store, will have a more significant effect on our results of operations than if we had a larger store base.\nBecause of our use of international vendors, we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws.\nWe source over half of our products abroad. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our employees or other agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations. Such violations, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space.\nWe lease certain of our retail properties, our two distribution centers and our corporate office. The profitability of our business is dependent on operating our current store base with favorable margins, opening and operating new stores at a reasonable profit, renewing leases for stores in desirable locations and, if necessary, identifying and closing underperforming stores. We lease a significant number of our store locations, ranging from short-term to long-term leases. Typically, a large portion of a store\u2019s operating expense is the cost associated with leasing the location.\nThe operating leases for our retail properties, distribution centers and corporate office expire at various dates through 2037. A number of the leases have renewal options for various periods of time at our discretion. We are typically responsible for taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance for these retail properties. Rent expense for the fiscal years ended January 25, 2020, January 26, 2019 and January 27, 2018 totaled approximately $144.3 million, $108.0 million and $83.4 million, respectively. Our future minimum rental commitments for all operating leases in existence as of January 25, 2020 for fiscal year 2021 is approximately $143.9 million and total approximately $1,695.3 million for fiscal years 2022 through 2037. We expect that many of the new stores we open will also be leased to us under operating leases, which will further increase our operating lease expenditures and require significant capital expenditures. We depend on cash flows from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our ABL Facility, or other sources, we may not be able to service our lease expenses or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would materially affect our business.\nOver time, current store locations may not continue to be desirable because of changes in demographics within the surrounding area or a decline in shopping traffic, including traffic generated by other nearby stores. Although we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions by making certain payments (typically within two to three years after opening a store), we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so. If we decide to close stores, we are generally required to either continue to pay rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or, for certain locations, pay exercise rights to terminate, which in either case could be expensive. Even if we are able to assign or sublease vacated locations where our lease cannot be terminated, we may remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform.\nIn addition, when leases for the stores in our ongoing operations expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, which could cause us to close stores in locations that may be desirable. We may be unable to relocate these stores cost-effectively or at all and there can be no assurance that any relocated stores will be successful.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our sale-leaseback strategy.\nFrom time to time, we engage in sale-leaseback transactions. The net proceeds from such transactions have been used to reduce outstanding debt and fund future capital expenditures for new store development. However, the sale-leaseback market may cease to be a reliable source of additional cash flows for us in the future if capitalization rates become less attractive, other unfavorable market conditions develop or the perceived value of our owned property declines. For example, should the sale-leaseback market require significantly higher yields (which may occur as interest rates rise), we may not enter into sale-leaseback transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to reduce outstanding debt and fund capital expenditures for future store development.\nWe operate in a highly competitive retail environment.\nThe retail business is highly competitive. The marketplace for home d\u00e9cor products is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by using a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies, dedicating a portion of their selling space to a limited selection of home d\u00e9cor, seasonal and holiday merchandise. Although we are the only big box concept solely dedicated to the home d\u00e9cor space, for all of our major products we compete with a diverse group of retailers, including mass merchants (such as Target and Wal-Mart), home improvement stores (such as Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s), craft retailers (such as Hobby Lobby, Jo-Ann Stores and Michaels Stores), home specialty/d\u00e9cor retailers (such as Bed Bath & Beyond, The Container Store, Home Goods and Pier 1 Imports), as well as various other small, independent retailers. In addition, we compete with Internet-based retailers (such as Wayfair and Amazon), which competition could intensify in the future.\nWe compete with these and other retailers for customers, retail locations, management and other personnel. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources, more customers and greater store brand recognition. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology, distribution and marketing. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause us to lose customers, sales and market share, which may require us to lower prices, increase marketing and advertising expenditures or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns, each of which could materially adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Further, although we do not currently engage in e-commerce, there is no assurance that we will not in the future, and the use of e-commerce by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Expansion into markets served by our competitors, entry of new competitors, expansion of existing competitors into our markets or the adoption by competitors of innovative store formats and retail sale methods, including e-commerce, could cause us to lose market share and could be detrimental to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOpening new stores in existing markets may negatively affect sales at our existing stores.\nThe consumer target area of our stores varies by location, depending on a number of factors, including population density, other local retail and business attractions, area demographics and geography. As a result, the opening of a new store in or near markets in which we already have stores could adversely affect the sales of existing stores.\nExisting stores could also make it more difficult to build our consumer base for a new store in the same market. Our business strategy does not entail opening new stores that we believe will materially affect sales at our existing stores, but we may selectively open new stores in and around geographic regions of existing stores that are operating at or near capacity to effectively serve our customers. Sales cannibalization between our stores may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and could affect our comparable store sales, which could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face risks related to our substantial indebtedness and limitations on future sources of liquidity.\nAs of January 25, 2020, we had total borrowings of $571.7 million outstanding under our ABL Facility and our Term Loan (as defined below). Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our ABL Facility and $350 million senior secured term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d). Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u25cf making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, and any failure to comply with the obligations under our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including as a result of disruption caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, lease payments, capital expenditures, selling and marketing efforts, product development, future business opportunities and other purposes;\n\u25cf exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as substantially all of our borrowings are at variable rates;\n\u25cf restricting us from making strategic acquisitions;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u25cf limiting our ability to plan for, or adjust to, changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less highly leveraged.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the credit agreements governing our ABL Facility and Term Loan.\nFurthermore, certain of our variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest. LIBOR has been the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, and it is currently expected that LIBOR will be discontinued after 2021. While our material financing arrangements indexed to LIBOR provide procedures for determining an alternative base rate in the event that LIBOR is discontinued, there can be no assurances as to whether such alternative base rate will be more or less favorable than LIBOR. We intend to monitor developments with respect to the phasing out of LIBOR. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nIn response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed all of our stores, of which approximately 20% are open only to curbside pickup and/or delivery as of the filing of this report, and borrowed $55 million in incremental borrowings under our ABL Facility. We expect the incremental borrowings to remain outstanding for the remainder of fiscal year 2021. Additionally, we are seeking to amend our ABL Facility to provide for further incremental\nborrowings but there is no assurance that we will be successful in borrowing such incremental funds and such additional borrowings may lead to fees, increased interest rates and interest expense, and additional restrictive covenants and other lender protections.. The extent and duration of any such store closures could continue to significantly adversely affect our cash flows from operations. In the event that our obligations exceed our cash generated from operations and currently available sources of liquidity, such as borrowings under our ABL Facility, our ability to meet our obligations when due could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that additional or alternative sources of liquidity, such as amendments or extensions of our existing credit facilities, financing from new lenders or investors, or financing from capital markets transactions, would be available to us in the event they were needed.\nThe ABL Facility and Term Loan impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business. If we are unable to comply with such restrictions, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe credit agreements governing our ABL Facility and Term Loan contain covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain disqualified or preferred stock;\n\u25cf pay dividends or make other distributions on, or redeem or purchase, any equity interests or make other restricted payments;\n\u25cf make certain acquisitions or investments;\n\u25cf create or incur liens;\n\u25cf transfer or sell assets;\n\u25cf incur restrictions on the payments of dividends or other distributions from our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u25cf alter the business that we conduct;\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25cf consummate a merger or consolidation or sell, assign, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nThe restrictions in the credit agreements governing our ABL Facility and Term Loan also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that could be in our interest.\nIn addition, our ability to borrow under the ABL Facility is limited by the amount of our borrowing base. Any negative impact on the elements of our borrowing base, such as accounts receivable and inventory, could reduce our borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility.\nIf we were unable to comply with the covenants of the ABL Facility or Term Loan and were not able to obtain a waiver, refinance or repay such debt facilities, it would lead to an event of default under such facilities, which could lead to an acceleration of the indebtedness under such debt facilities. From time to time, we may seek consents or waivers from our lenders with respect to certain covenants or restrictions under the credit agreements governing our ABL Facility and/or Term Loan. Any covenant waivers that may be required may lead to fees associated with obtaining the waiver, increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections, and such increased costs, restrictions and modifications may vary among debt facilities. In addition, our ability to provide additional lender protections under these facilities if necessary, including the granting of security interests in collateral, will be limited by the restrictions in our debt facilities. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain future\nwaivers in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. If we were not able to obtain a covenant waiver under one or more of these debt facilities, we would be in default of such agreements, which could result in cross defaults to our other debt agreements. As a consequence, we would need to refinance or repay the applicable debt facility or facilities, and would be required to raise additional debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay such facility or facilities. If we were to be unable to obtain a covenant waiver in the future under any one or more of these debt facilities, there can be no assurance that we would be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay such facility or facilities.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our senior management and our buyers.\nWe are dependent on the services, abilities and experiences of our senior management team. Any loss or interruption of the services of our senior management, or any general instability in the composition of our senior management team, could significantly reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations. Lee Bird, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, joined us in December 2012 and, together with our senior management team, has played an instrumental role in developing and executing our business and operating strategies, which we believe are critical to our ability to maintain strong margins. Therefore, the loss of Mr. Bird\u2019s services, or any members of our senior management, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and profitability and there can be no assurance that we will be able to find appropriate replacements for our senior management as needed. In addition, certain members of our management team are relatively new to our business and have not worked as a team with other members of management for a significant period of time. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any new members of our management team will be able to successfully execute our business and operating strategies or continue to follow the same strategies.\nIn addition, a number of our buyers have been with us for many years and have developed a deep understanding of our business and our customers. The market for buyers is highly competitive and it may be difficult to find suitable replacements if we lose any of our buyers. If we are unable to find suitable replacements, we may experience difficulties in selecting and sourcing merchandise, which could materially adversely impact our business, revenue and profitability.\nFailure to attract and retain quality employees could materially adversely affect our performance.\nOur performance depends on attracting and retaining quality people at all levels, including corporate, stores, the distribution centers and other areas. Many of our store employees are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment requirements. In the event of changes in the federal or state minimum wage, living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations, including, for example, health care or employee leave regulations, if our overall compensation and benefits fail to remain competitive, then the quality of our workforce could decline, while increasing our costs could impair our profitability. If we do not continue to attract and retain quality employees, our performance could be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, there can be no assurance that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements or work practices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and store closures resulting from shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders by state and local governments, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 we eliminated approximately 10% of home office roles, primarily related to new store development and openings, and implemented temporary furloughs of approximately 30% of home office associates and approximately 15% of store employees (a portion of whom have been reinstated as of the filing of this report) and a hiring freeze. These actions could create risks, including but not limited to, our ability to manage the size of our workforce given uncertain future demand. If employees terminate their employment, become ill as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations, our business activities may be adversely affected and our management team\u2019s attention may be diverted. Additionally, we may not be able to recruit suitable replacements for those employees who leave, or\noffer employment to potential replacements on terms they find desirable, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDifficulties with our vendors may adversely impact our business.\nOur performance depends on our ability to purchase merchandise at sufficient levels and at competitive prices from vendors who can deliver products in a timely and efficient manner and in compliance with our vendor standards and all applicable laws and regulations. We currently have over 500 vendor relationships. Generally, we do not have any long-term purchase agreements or other contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could discontinue selling to us at any time. Historically, we have not relied on any single vendor for our products and have not had difficulties replacing vendors for various products we sell. However, in the future there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities or on terms acceptable to us, or be able to develop relationships with new vendors to replace any discontinued vendors. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise in the future or our failure to replace any one or more vendors may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any significant change in the payment terms that we have with our suppliers could adversely affect our liquidity.\nMany of our suppliers are small firms that produce a limited number of items. These smaller vendors generally have limited resources, production capacities and operating histories, and some of our vendors have limited the distribution of their merchandise in the past. Accordingly, these vendors may be susceptible to cash flow issues, downturns in economic conditions, the imposition of tariffs or other trade restrictions, production difficulties, quality control issues and difficulty delivering agreed-upon quantities on schedule and in compliance with regulatory requirements. If a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, including supply chain disruptions as a result of epidemic disease (such as the global COVID-19 pandemic), we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales, especially with respect to seasonal and holiday merchandise. In addition, there is no assurance that we would be able, if necessary, to return product to these vendors, obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain reimbursement or indemnification from any of our vendors should we so desire, and from time to time, we may be in litigation with one or more vendors. Many of these suppliers require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to supply products in the quantities we need. This long lead time requires us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale, exposing us to shifts in consumer demand and discretionary spending.\nOur business is moderately seasonal and weak performance during one of our historically strong seasonal periods could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the entire fiscal year.\nOur business is moderately seasonal, with a meaningful portion of our sales dedicated to seasonal and holiday merchandise, resulting in the realization of higher portions of net sales and operating income in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to the importance of our peak sales periods, which include the spring and year-end holiday decorating seasons, the second and fourth fiscal quarters have historically contributed, and are expected to continue to contribute, significantly to our operating results for the entire fiscal year. In anticipation of seasonal increases in sales activity during these periods, we incur significant additional expense prior to and during our peak seasonal periods, which we may finance with additional short-term borrowings. These expenses may include the acquisition of additional inventory, seasonal staffing needs and other similar items. As a result, any factors negatively affecting us during these periods, including adverse weather and unfavorable economic conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially and historical quarterly operating results may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many outside of our control, including:\n\u25cf general economic and political conditions;\n\u25cf the mix of merchandise sold;\n\u25cf shifts in consumer tastes and changes in demand for the products that we offer in our stores;\n\u25cf calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods;\n\u25cf the timing of new store openings and the level of pre-opening expenses associated with new stores;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of sales contributed by new stores;\n\u25cf store closings or relocations and costs related thereto;\n\u25cf expansion of existing or entry of new competitors into our markets;\n\u25cf competition among our stores within the same or adjacent geographic regions;\n\u25cf pricing and other actions taken by our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in promotions, advertising or other actions taken by us or our existing or possible new competitors;\n\u25cf the timing and level of markdowns;\n\u25cf delays in the flow of merchandise to our stores, including due to port congestion, supply chain disruption and other shipment delays;\n\u25cf changes in our operating expenses;\n\u25cf the imposition of tariffs or other trade restrictions;\n\u25cf changes in commodity prices, the cost of fuel, freight costs and other costs incurred due to tariff-related shipment surges;\n\u25cf government shutdowns;\n\u25cf foreign exchange rates;\n\u25cf litigation;\n\u25cf adverse weather conditions in our markets, particularly on weekends;\n\u25cf natural or man-made disasters, including epidemic or pandemic disease (such as COVID-19);\n\u25cf the timing of income tax refunds to our customers;\n\u25cf the timing or elimination of certain state and local tax holidays; and\n\u25cf changes in other tenants or landlords or surrounding geographic circumstances in the areas in which we are located.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the fiscal quarter in which such event occurs as well as for the entire fiscal year. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of historical quarterly operating results may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.\nWe may not be able to protect our important intellectual property and we could incur substantial costs if we are subject to claims that our operations infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nWe rely on our proprietary intellectual property, including trademarks, to market, promote and sell our products in our stores, particularly our At Home private label products. We monitor and protect against activities that might infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademarks and other intellectual property and rely on the trademark and other laws of the United States. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization. To the extent we cannot protect our intellectual property, unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nAdditionally, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not in the future infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, we have been subject to claims from third parties that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights and we face the risk of such claims in the future. Any intellectual property infringement claims against us could be costly, time-consuming, harmful to our reputation or result in injunctive or other equitable relief that may require us to make changes to our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nIncreases in commodity prices and supply chain costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nVarious commodities are used in our merchandise, such as petroleum, resin, copper, steel, cotton and lumber. These commodities are subject to inflation, price fluctuations and other market disturbances, including supply shortages. Increases in commodity prices or the costs related to our supply chain and distribution network, including currency exchange rates, tariffs, labor, fuel, freight and other transportation costs, could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin, expenses and results of operations. Due to the uncertainty of these price fluctuations and our strategy to maintain everyday low prices, we may not be able to pass some or all of these increased costs on to our customers. Even if we are able to pass these increased costs on to our customers, we may not be able to do so on a timely basis, our gross margins could decline and we may not be able to implement other price increases for our merchandise.\nOur significant investments in advertising, marketing or promotions could cause our margins and profitability to materially decline.\nIn general, we employ an everyday low pricing strategy that avoids high-low pricing and promotions which has historically allowed us to minimize advertising and marketing expenses incurred by other retailers. However, as our growth strategy has increased our store presence in new markets, we have had to refocus marketing spend, including increasing marketing and advertising expenditures in new or smaller markets in which we have less store density in order to build brand awareness. We have increased marketing and advertising spend as a percentage of our net sales in each of the fiscal years since our initial public offering and expect that marketing and advertising spend will continue to be a significant percentage of net sales in future fiscal years. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have significantly curtailed advertising spend, consulting projects and non-essential operating expenses. There is no assurance that any further investments we have made or may make in the future with respect to advertising, marketing or promotions will be successful or result in a positive return on investment. Therefore, if we are required to make significant investments in advertising, marketing or promotions and related expenditures, our margins and profitability could materially decline even if sales increase.\nAny online services or e-commerce activities that we may launch in the future may require substantial investment and may not be successful.\nWe do not currently engage in e-commerce and have a limited online presence through our website and other forms of social media. In fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020, we upgraded our website to be mobile-friendly and enable our customers to view our product assortment online with robust search functionality and optimized the user experience, but we do not currently sell merchandise through our website. However, as part of our growth strategy, we are exploring expansion of our online services and could engage in e-commerce activities in the future, which would require substantial investment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we piloted the first stages of our BOPIS initiative by offering a reserve online capability in select markets.\nIn response to the outbreak of COVID-19, we substantially increased our BOPIS capabilities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Currently, more than 200 stores, or over 90% of our store base, have BOPIS capabilities; however, there can be no assurance that our e-commerce initiatives will be extended to all of our stores in the future or that BOPIS capabilities will be developed further into a full purchase online capability. These initiatives involve a significant investment in technology and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omnichannel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our omnichannel initiatives is not successful or does not meet customer expectations, we may not realize a return on our omnichannel investments and our reputation and operating results may be adversely affected. The success of any online services or e-commerce business would depend, in part, on factors over which we may not control. We would need to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to online or e-commerce usage. We would also be vulnerable to increased risks and uncertainties including: changes in required technology interfaces; website downtime and other technical failures; costs and technical issues related to upgrading website software; computer viruses; changes in applicable federal and state regulations; security breaches; consumer privacy concerns; and keeping up to date with competitive technology trends, including the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other online or e-commerce marketing tools. In addition, any e-commerce platform may be unprofitable, cannibalize sales from our existing stores or not be able to compete successfully against other Internet-based retailers who sell similar merchandise. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect sales in any e-commerce business that we establish in the future and could damage our reputation and brand. Further, in the event that we engage in e-commerce in the future, we will need to establish a shipping and delivery system for items purchased online, for which we do not currently have adequate capability. Our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully develop and integrate such a shipping and delivery system in connection with any e-commerce business in which we may engage in the future.\nChanges in consumer buying patterns, particularly the use of e-commerce sites and off premise sales, affect our revenues, operating results and liquidity.\nConsumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, a growing portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers is occurring online and through mobile commerce applications and a declining portion of total consumer expenditures is occurring at brick and mortar retail locations. This shift in consumer buying patterns negatively impacts consumer traffic at traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail sites located in regional malls, lifestyle centers, \u201cbig box\u201d shopping centers and entertainment centers. A decline in visitors to these centers near our stores may negatively affect our sales. Additionally, e-commerce has caused some \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail sites to cease operations, and it may continue to cause future \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail sites to cease operations. These closures of traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d retail sites may lead to reduced customer traffic and a general deterioration in the surrounding retail centers in which our stores are located and may contribute to lower customer traffic at our stores.\nBecause we rely on the ability of our physical retail locations to remain relevant to customers, providing desirable and sought-out shopping experiences is critical to our financial success. Changes in consumer shopping habits could adversely impact the traffic at current retail locations and lead to a decline in our financial condition or performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to reverse any decline in traffic or that any future e-commerce initiatives will offset any decline in store traffic. We may need to respond to any declines in customer traffic or conversion rates by increasing markdowns or promotions to attract customers, which could adversely impact our operating results and cash flows from operating activities. In addition, the challenge of declining store traffic along with the growth of digital shopping channels and its diversion of sales from brick-and-mortar stores could lead to store closures and/or asset impairment charges, which could adversely impact our operating results, financial position and cash flows. In addition, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we may be disadvantaged because customers are unable or unwilling to visit our brick and mortar stores for an extended period of time.\nOur inability to successfully execute and optimize an omnichannel strategy and maintain a relevant and reliable omnichannel experience for our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, growth strategy, financial condition and results of operations.\nCustomer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are evolving. Customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices and to purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products. Given\nongoing concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, there is heightened customer demand for a low-touch shopping experience and contactless deliveries. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. Our ability to compete with other retailers and to meet our customer expectations may suffer if we are unable to provide relevant customer-facing technology and omnichannel experiences. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing strategies to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs. Failure to enhance our technology and marketing efforts to align with our customers\u2019 developing shopping preferences could significantly impair our ability to meet our strategic, business and financial goals. If we do not successfully execute and optimize our omnichannel operations and initiatives, including the recent roll-out of our BOPIS initiative, or if such initiatives do not achieve their intended objectives, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we may incur significant costs in connection with the implementation, ongoing use, or discontinuation of omnichannel initiatives, which could adversely affect our operations, liquidity and financial condition. The omnichannel initiatives we implement may not resonate with our customers. It may take longer than anticipated to generate the expected benefits from our omnichannel initiatives and there can be no guarantee that these initiatives will provide the anticipated benefits or result in improved operating results. Any such failure to successfully implement our omnichannel initiatives could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.\nWe may be required to record goodwill and other impairment charges, which could have a material adverse non-cash impact on our results of operations.\nGoodwill as of January 25, 2020 totaled $319.7 million. We are required to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets might be impaired. Our regular annual goodwill impairment testing is performed during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, with effect from the beginning of the fourth quarter. The impairment test requires numerous assumptions such as, among others, future sales trends, operating margins, store count and capital expenditures. In addition, changes in our market capitalization may impact certain assumptions in any impairment test. If our actual financial results in the future are below our projections or if our stock price continues to experience a sustained decline, including as a result of market reaction to the global outbreak of COVID-19, we may be required to record significant impairment charges associated with our goodwill and intangible assets, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, because we experienced a decline in operating performance and uncertainty regarding the impact of tariffs on our margins, coupled with a decision to reduce our near-term growth model, we conducted an interim impairment testing of goodwill. Based on the test results, we concluded that no impairment was necessary for the $569.7 million implied fair value of goodwill on our balance sheet at the time of testing. Further, as of our annual testing date of October 27, 2019, we determined that there had not been a significant change in facts and circumstances since our interim impairment testing date to warrant a different conclusion as to the fair value of our reporting unit. However, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, because we continued to experience a decline in operating performance and a sustained decline in our market capitalization, we conducted an additional interim impairment testing of goodwill. Based on the results of our impairment test performed, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $250.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 25, 2020. Additionally, future impairment charges could be required if we do not achieve our current net sales and profitability projections, which would occur if we are not able to meet our new store growth targets, or if our weighted average cost of capital increases. Moreover, changes in our market capitalization may impact certain assumptions used in our income approach calculations.\nThe goodwill impairment charge for the fiscal year ended January 25, 2020 does not include the subsequent impact of the COVID-19 outbreak as those conditions did not exist as of January 25, 2020. If future economic conditions continue to deteriorate, especially given the uncertainty of the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, or if our weighted average cost of capital increases, additional impairment charges could be required in the future. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, our market capitalization indicated goodwill would be fully impaired.\nAdditionally, during the fourth quarter, rating agencies downgraded our Term Loan. See Note 1-Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nIn addition, we periodically evaluate certain long-lived assets for impairment. During the fiscal year ended January 25, 2020, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $5.2 million in connection with store closure and relocation decisions. There can be no assurance that we will not incur similar non-cash charges in future periods.\nDisruptions to our information systems, or our failure to adequately support, maintain and upgrade these systems, could negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nWe depend on our information technology systems for critical aspects of our business. We have made significant investments in information technology, including investments in systems and applications for finance and accounting functions, supply chain management software for retail operations and data warehouse management systems and an automated distribution system for our distribution center operations. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of data and overall network security. We purchase our inventory through a centralized inventory management system that operates for the entire chain. Merchandise is bar-coded, enabling management to control inventory and pricing by SKU. Sales are updated daily in the merchandise reporting systems by polling all sales information from each store\u2019s point-of sale terminals. Stores are then staffed based on a statistically developed labor model which incorporates the daily and hourly store sales volume. We attempt to mitigate the risk of possible business interruptions caused by disruptions to our information systems by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes maintaining backup systems off-site. However, despite safeguards and careful contingency planning, our systems are still subject to power outages, computer viruses, computer and telecommunication failures, employee usage errors, security breaches, terrorism, natural or man-made disasters and other catastrophic events. A major disruption of our information systems and backup mechanisms may cause us to incur significant costs to repair our systems and experience a critical loss of data. System failures could also disrupt our ability to track, record and analyze sales and inventory and could cause disruptions of our operations, including, among other things, our ability to process and ship inventory, process financial information including credit card transactions, process payrolls or vendor payments or engage in other similar normal business activities. All of this could potentially result in financial loss, reputational harm, and reimbursement costs associated with inability to properly conduct business. Further, we may be unable to improve, upgrade, integrate or expand upon our existing systems and any costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.\nOur information technology systems could also be adversely affected by changes that result from COVID-19, including, for example, the significant increase in remote work by our employees and the increase in online orders due to restrictions on our retail operations. A major disruption of the systems and their backup mechanisms may cause us to incur significant costs to repair the systems, experience a critical loss of data and/or result in business interruptions.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm our business and standing with our customers and subject us to penalties under data protection rules and privacy laws.\nThe protection of our customer, employee and other company data is critical to us. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer information, such as payment card and personal information. We devote significant resources to maintain our computer systems, including insurance policies that may, subject to policy terms and limitations, cover a cyber-attack or data breach. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, payment card terminal tampering, computer viruses, ransomware, misplaced, lost or stolen data, programming or human errors or other similar events. Like many retailers, our information systems and those of our vendors may come under attack by U.S. and foreign criminal elements seeking access to our data. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access to data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage our facilities and systems are constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. The ever-evolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. We and our third-party service providers may not anticipate or prevent all types of attacks until after they have already been launched, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our\nemployees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. The risks associated with our processing of sensitive customer data may be heightened if the amount of such data collected is increased, including via the co-branded and private label credit card and customer loyalty programs that we launched during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. Our collection and use of information is regulated at the international, national and state levels. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our third-party service providers, could damage our reputation, financial loss, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, expose us to risk of litigation and liability, regulatory actions, regulatory fines and penalties, additional compliance costs, reimbursement or other compensation costs, disrupt our operations and harm our business. In addition, as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense. As a result, we may incur significant costs to change our business practices or modify our service offerings in connection with the protection of personally identifiable information.\nWe are subject to consumer privacy regulation at the state level, including under the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires new disclosures to California consumers, imposes new rules for collecting or using information, requires companies to comply with data subject access and deletion requests, and affords California consumers new abilities to opt out of certain disclosures of personal information. It remains unclear what, if any, regulations may be implemented pursuant to the law. The effects of consumer privacy regulations including the CCPA could potentially be significant and require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.\nAlthough we have implemented policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, if our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with applicable current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to fines, litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data or our marketing practices or other liabilities such as compensation claims by individuals affected by a personal data breach, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business.\nRegulatory or litigation developments could materially adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to numerous statutory, regulatory and legal requirements at a local, state, national and international level because of our business operations, store locations, workforce, sales to consumers and importation of merchandise. In addition, as a publicly traded company we may be exposed to the risk of stockholder litigation if our stock price declines. Laws and regulations affecting our business may change, sometimes frequently and significantly, as a result of political, economic, social or other events. Changes in the regulatory environment in the areas of product safety, environmental protection, privacy and information security, health care, labor and employment, U.S. customs, advertising and taxes, among others, could potentially impact our operations and financial results. For example, more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations. Environmental laws and regulations also govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water as well as the presence, handling, release and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances. These laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance. Third parties may also make personal injury, property damage or other claims against us associated with actual or alleged release of, or exposure to, hazardous substances at our properties. We could also be strictly liable, without regard to fault, for certain environmental conditions at properties we formerly owned or operated as well as at our current properties. We could be negatively impacted by developments in these areas due to the costs of compliance, and if we fail to comply with a law or regulation, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines, penalties, loss of a license or permit and adverse publicity or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nProduct recalls and/or product liability, as well as changes in product safety and other consumer protection laws, may adversely impact our operations, merchandise offerings, reputation, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe are subject to regulations by a variety of federal, state and international regulatory authorities, including The Consumer Product Safety Commission. A large portion of our merchandise is manufactured in foreign countries. As such, one or more of our vendors might not adhere to product safety requirements or our quality control standards, and we might not identify the deficiency before merchandise ships to our stores. If our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers\u2019 expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales and increased\ncosts and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. We could be required to recall some of those products or could expose ourselves to government enforcement action or private litigation, such as product liability claims, which could result in significant fines, penalties, monetary damages and other remedies as well as harm to our reputation. We could also be subject to litigation related to injuries or other accidents at our stores or distribution center.\nMoreover, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs to us for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. Long lead times on merchandise ordering cycles increase the difficulty for us to plan and prepare for potential changes to applicable laws. In particular, The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 imposes significant requirements on manufacturing, importing, testing and labeling requirements for some of our products. In the event that we are unable to timely comply with regulatory changes, significant fines or penalties could result, and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nInadequacy of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe maintain third-party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss and business interruption, as well as directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage. While we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements. Significant uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nOur continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of At Home.\nWe are highly dependent on our reputation amongst home d\u00e9cor enthusiasts. To remain successful in the future, we must continue to preserve, grow and utilize the value of our reputation as the destination retailer for our customers\u2019 home d\u00e9cor needs. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents may erode trust and confidence. Events that can damage our reputation include, but are not limited to, legal violations, litigation, actual or perceived ethical problems, product safety issues, actual or perceived poor employee relations, actual or perceived poor customer service, store appearance or operational issues, unauthorized use or other misappropriation of our trade name, data security, terrorism, outbreak of disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other events outside of our control that could generate negative publicity with respect to At Home, whether in traditional media or social media outlets. Any event that has the potential to negatively impact our trade name or our reputation with customers, employees, suppliers, communities, governmental officials and others could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur operating results and financial position could be negatively impacted by accounting policies, rules and regulations.\nOur operating results and financial position could be negatively impacted by implementation of our various accounting policies as well as changes to accounting rules and regulations or new interpretations of existing accounting standards. These changes may include, without limitation, changes to lease accounting standards. In addition, from time to time, we could incur impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results. For example, changes in economic or operating conditions impacting our estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of intangible assets (such as our goodwill or trade name) or long-lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. In the event that we determine our intangible or long-lived assets are impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges to the U.S. tax laws and in our effective tax rate may have a material impact on our business.\nOur effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors. Changes in the tax laws (including those related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations.\nThe Internal Revenue Service is continuing to issue guidance related to the Tax Act and there can be no assurance that we will not be required to record charges to income in future periods as the proposed regulations are released.\nWe are a holding company with no operations of our own, and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash.\nWe are a holding company and do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our subsidiaries. Our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our obligations or to pay dividends, if any, is highly dependent on the earnings of, and receipt of funds from, our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans. The ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us and them to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on their future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. We cannot assure our stockholders that the cash flow and earnings of our operating subsidiaries will be adequate for our subsidiaries to service their debt obligations. If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy corporate obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans (such as refinancing), restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. We cannot assure our stockholders that any such alternative refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future that may severely restrict or prohibit our subsidiaries from making distributions, paying dividends, if any, or making loans to us.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid for them.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be volatile, and our stockholders can lose all or part of their investment. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our operating results compared to market expectations;\n\u25cf changes in the preferences of our customers;\n\u25cf low comparable store sales growth compared to market expectations;\n\u25cf delays in the planned openings of new stores;\n\u25cf the failure of securities analysts to cover the Company or changes in analysts\u2019 financial estimates;\n\u25cf economic, legal, regulatory and political factors unrelated to our performance, including the imposition of tariffs or other trade restrictions;\n\u25cf changes in consumer spending or the housing market;\n\u25cf events beyond our control, such as war, terrorist attacks, epidemic or pandemic illness (such as COVID-19), transportation, freight and fuel prices, natural disasters or severe weather;\n\u25cf increased competition or stock price performance of our competitors;\n\u25cf future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u25cf changes in senior management or key personnel;\n\u25cf investor perceptions of us and the retail industry;\n\u25cf new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u25cf lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities;\n\u25cf action by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders;\n\u25cf failure to meet any guidance given by us or any change in any guidance given by us, or changes by us in our guidance practices;\n\u25cf speculation in the press or investment community; and\n\u25cf the other factors listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, our stock price may be volatile. The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. Accordingly, these broad market and industry factors may significantly reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nBecause certain existing stockholders hold a significant percentage of our common stock, they may influence major corporate decisions and their interests may conflict with your interests as an owner of our common stock and those of the Company.\nAEA currently owns approximately 16.4% of our common stock. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders' Agreement, dated as of July 22, 2016, among the Company and certain affiliates of AEA and Starr Investments, as long as certain affiliates of AEA, in the aggregate, hold at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, AEA shall be entitled to nominate at least one individual for election to our board, and our board and nominating committee thereof shall nominate and recommend to our stockholders that such individual be elected to our board. Consequently, although we are no longer a controlled company, AEA continues to exercise the right to nominate a director to our Board and to be able to influence our business, affairs and policies, including the appointment of our management and the entering into of business combinations or dispositions and other corporate transactions.\nAEA may have interests that are different from our other stockholders and may vote in a way with which our other stockholders disagree and which may be adverse to such stockholders' interests. In addition, AEA\u2019s concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their common stock.\nAdditionally, AEA is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us or supply us with goods and services. AEA may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Stockholders should consider that AEA\u2019s interests may differ from their interests in material respects.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nMoreover, the approximately 16.4% of our outstanding common stock held by AEA and the approximately 6.7% of our outstanding common stock held by Starr Investments has been registered for resale on Form S-3. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement to which we and such holders are parties, these holders have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to facilitate future offerings of their shares, which would result in their shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, unless purchased by affiliates (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act). In November 2018, the shares of our common stock owned by Starr Investments became eligible for sale without registration pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, but such shares may still be sold in connection with future offerings pursuant to the registration rights agreement. Sales of stock by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of May 15, 2020, we had 64,185,751 shares of common stock outstanding. Of these shares, all but the 10,536,504 shares of our common stock held by AEA, as well as the shares held by our executive officers and directors, are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act.\nOn April 5, 2017, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register the shares of common stock to be issued under our equity compensation plans and, as a result, all shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of stock options granted under our plans are also freely tradable under the Securities Act, unless held by our affiliates. As of January 25, 2020, there were stock options outstanding to purchase a total of 5,825,516 shares of our common stock and 748,512 shares of our common stock subject to restricted stock units. In addition, as of January 25, 2020, 4,917,609 shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance under our Equity Incentive Plan.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about At Home, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that third-party securities analysts publish about At Home and the retail industry. One or more analysts could downgrade our common stock or issue other negative commentary about At Home or our industry. In addition, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of At Home, we could lose visibility in the market. As a result of one or more of these factors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:\n\u25cf establishing a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u25cf allowing the total number of directors to be determined exclusively (subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors) by resolution of our board of directors and granting to our board the sole power (subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock or rights granted pursuant to the stockholders\u2019 agreement) to fill any vacancy on the board;\n\u25cf limiting the ability of stockholders to remove directors without cause;\n\u25cf authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock by our board of directors, without further stockholder approval, to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf prohibiting stockholder action by written consent (and, thus, requiring that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders);\n\u25cf eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at annual stockholder meetings; and\n\u25cf requiring the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, to amend or repeal our certificate of incorporation or bylaws.\nIn addition, while we have opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains similar provisions providing that we may not engage in certain \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a three-year period following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n\u25cf prior to such time, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\n\u25cf upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or\n\u25cf at or subsequent to that time, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nGenerally, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction provided for or through our Company resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and the affiliates and associates of such person. For purposes of this provision, \u201cvoting stock\u201d means any class or series of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that AEA, Starr Investments, their respective affiliates and any of their respective direct or indirect designated transferees (other than in certain market transfers and gifts) and any group of which such persons are a party do not constitute \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for purposes of this provision.\nUnder certain circumstances, this provision will make it more difficult for a person who qualifies as an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to effect certain business combinations with our Company for a three-year period. This provision may encourage companies interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors in order to avoid the stockholder approval requirement if our board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our board of directors and may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that our stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those that our stockholders desire.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe are required to comply with the management certification requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We currently perform the system and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) required to comply with the management certification requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Because we ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the end of our fiscal year ended January 26, 2019, we are now subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the first time in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, among other additional requirements.\nCompliance with Section 404 is expensive and time consuming for management and may result in the detection of control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity under applicable SEC and PCAOB rules and regulations that remain unremediated. As a public company, we are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d or changes in internal controls that, or that are reasonably likely to, materially affect internal controls over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A \u201csignificant deficiency\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting.\nTo continue to comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have undertaken various actions, such as implementing and enhancing our internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal controls can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. Additionally, if we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis, and our financial statements may be materially misstated. For example, in the past, certain matters involving our internal controls over financial reporting that constituted \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d were identified and have since been remediated, which related to our limited accounting personnel and other resources at the time, as well as our adoption of public company standards. If we identify any additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, if we are required to make further restatements of our financial statements, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting , investors may lose confidence in the accuracy, completeness or reliability of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected, and we could become subject to sanctions or investigations by the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. In addition, if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements could be inaccurate and we could face restricted access to the capital markets.\nWe do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends.\nThe continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. We are a holding company, and substantially all of our operations are carried out by our operating subsidiaries. Under our ABL Facility and Term Loan, our operating subsidiaries are significantly restricted in their ability to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us, and we expect these limitations to continue in the future. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the NYSE, may strain our resources, increase our costs and divert management\u2019s attention, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the corporate governance standards of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the NYSE. These requirements place a strain on our management,\nsystems and resources and we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Exchange Act requires us to file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition within specified time periods and to prepare a proxy statement with respect to our annual meeting of stockholders. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. The NYSE requires that we comply with various corporate governance requirements. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and comply with the Exchange Act and the NYSE\u2019s requirements, significant resources and management oversight are required. This may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and lead to significant costs associated with compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on us and the price of our common stock.\nThe expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect that continuing compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to maintain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt even more changes in governance and reporting requirements. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of these costs. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our stockholders are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.", "PERMNO": 16268, "SIC": 5700, "TIC": "HOME"}
