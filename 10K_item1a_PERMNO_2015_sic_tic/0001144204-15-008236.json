{"cik": "1562214", "company": "HF2 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Organizational Structure after the Business Combination\nPursuant to the Investment Agreement, 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock will be transferred from the HF2 Class B Trust to a new trust controlled by Christian Zugel and, as a result, Mr. Zugel will control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock.\nUnlike other similarly structured blank check companies, we are authorized to issue two classes of common stock. The HF2 Class B Trust currently holds an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, which is all of the outstanding Class B Common Stock. Shares of Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share and vote with the holders of Class A Common Stock, as a single class, on all matters presented to holders of our common stock for a vote.\nPursuant to the Investment Agreement, at the Closing of the Business Combination 20,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock will be transferred to the ZGP Founder Members and immediately deposited with the ZGH Class B Trust, a newly created irrevocable trust, of which Christian Zugel is the initial sole trustee. The ZGH Class B Trust will be entitled to vote the shares of Class B Common Stock in its own discretion and will represent approximately 89.4% of the combined voting power of our common stock, assuming no Redemptions of our Class A Common Stock, following the Closing of the Business Combination, or 92.4%, assuming 7,142,857 shares of Class A Common Stock are redeemed. In the future, even if all 180,000,000 authorized shares of Class A Common Stock are issued and outstanding, and assuming the 20,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock remain outstanding, the holders of Class B Common Stock will hold approximately 52.6% of the combined voting power of our common stock. The number of shares of Class B Common Stock may be reduced in the future if the ZGP Founder Members\u2019 ownership of the Company decreases below 20%.\nFor so long as the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock represent at least a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, the holders of Class B Common Stock will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our management and affairs, including determinations with respect to acquisitions, dispositions, borrowings, issuances of securities, and the declaration and payment of dividends. In addition, the holders of Class B Common Stock will be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring approval of our stockholders, and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of the Company or a change in the composition of our board of directors, and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of the Company even though it may be in the best interests of the holders of Class A Common Stock. In particular, this concentration of voting power could deprive holders of Class A Common Stock of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of Class A Common Stock as part of a sale of the Company, and could ultimately adversely affect the market price of the Class A Common Stock.\nMr. Zugel and the Founder Members will have voting control and other significant influence over us, and their interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\nImmediately following the Business Combination, the ZGH Class B Trust will hold all of the Class B Common Stock. As sole trustee of the ZGH Class B Trust, Mr. Zugel will have control over approximately 89.4% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of the Company, assuming no Redemptions of our Class A Common Stock, or 92.4%, assuming 7,142,857 shares of Class A Common Stock are redeemed, subject to reduction if the ownership the Company by the ZGP Founder Members decreases below 20%. The Founder Members also have consent rights under the New LLC Agreement with respect to certain actions of ZGP. Immediately following the Business Combination, Mr. Zugel, together with Mr. Zugel\u2019s spouse and family trusts and Laureen Lim, will own approximately 22% of the outstanding Units (assuming no public shares are redeemed and there are no adjustments pursuant to the Investment Agreement and the 1,600,000 Class B Units have been issued to ZAIS employees and vested). Because such interest will be held directly in ZGP, rather than through the Company, Mr. Zugel, as an owner of Units, may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of the Class A Common Stock. For example, if ZGP makes distributions to the Company, the ZGP Founder Members and other members will also be entitled to receive such distributions pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership in ZGP and their preferences as to the timing and amount of any such distributions may differ from those of our public stockholders. Mr. Zugel or his family trusts may also have different tax positions from us that could influence his decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of ZGP\u2019s assets, especially in light of the Tax Receivable Agreement that we will enter into in connection with the Business Combination, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when the Company should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate its obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration Mr. Zugel\u2019s tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us or our shareholders.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, our only significant asset will be ownership of approximately 73.3% of ZGP. We will have no operations of our own and no independent ability to generate revenue, and may not have sufficient funds to pay taxes, pay dividends on the Class A Common Stock, if any, or make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, we will have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the ownership of approximately 73.3% of ZGP or approximately 77.1% of ZGP excluding the 1,600,000 unvested Class B Units that are contemplated to be issued to key ZAIS employees following the Closing (in each case, assuming no public shares are redeemed and there are no adjustments pursuant to the Investment Agreement). With no operations of our own and no independent ability to generate revenue, we will accordingly be dependent upon distributions from ZGP to pay our taxes, pay dividends to our stockholders and make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We are required to pay taxes on our allocable share of the taxable income of ZGP without regard to whether ZGP distributes any cash or other property to us.\nAlthough the New LLC Agreement requires ZGP to make distributions to the holders of its Units (including us) pro rata equal to the income tax on the cumulative positive taxable income of ZGP as determined based on an assumed tax rate and certain other factors, ZGP must have sufficient available cash in order to make these distributions. Further, although we intend to cause ZGP to make sufficient distributions to allow us to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and pay dividends, if any, to our stockholders, deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of ZGP and ZAIS for any reason could limit or impair ZGP\u2019s ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent that we need funds and ZGP is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nPayments of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs (including our obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement), plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay dividends. Any financing arrangement that we enter into in the future may include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends. In addition, ZGP is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of ZGP (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets. ZAIS and its subsidiaries are generally subject to similar legal limitations on their ability to make distributions to ZGP.\nAlthough we may be entitled to tax benefits relating to additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions as a result of the tax basis step-up we receive in connection with exchanges of Units into Class A Common Stock and related transactions, we will be required to pay the exchanging members of ZGP 85% of these tax benefits under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nHolders of Units (other than us) may, subject to certain conditions and transfer restrictions, exchange their Units for Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. These exchanges are expected to result in increases in our allocable share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of ZGP. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income or franchise tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or any applicable foreign, state or local tax authority may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, we will enter into the Tax Receivable Agreement, which provides for the payment by the Company to exchanging holders of Units of 85% of income or franchise tax benefits, if any, that the Company realizes as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including income or franchise tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. This payment obligation is an obligation of the Company and not of ZGP. While the actual increase in our allocable share of ZGP\u2019s tax basis in its assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of shares of Class A Common Stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income, we expect that as a result of the possible size and frequency of the exchanges and the resulting increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of ZGP, the payments that the Company expects to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of us by the holders of Units.\nThe exchanging holders of Units will not be required to reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, excess payments made to such holders will be netted against payments otherwise to be made, if any, after the determination of such excess. As a result, in certain circumstances we could make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of our actual income or franchise tax savings, which could materially impair our financial condition.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, in the event that we exercise our right to early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, or in the event of a change in control of the Company, the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate, and we will be required to make a lump-sum payment to the ZGP Founder Members and holders of Class B Units (which are parties to the Tax Receivable Agreement and continue to hold Units as of such date) equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our future taxable income and that all holders of Units which are parties to the Exchange Agreement would exchange their Units on the date of the termination. The change of control payment and termination payments to these holders of Units could be substantial and could exceed the actual tax benefits that we receive as a result of acquiring Units from other owners of ZGP because the amounts of such payments would be calculated assuming that we would have been able to use the potential tax benefits each year for the remainder of the amortization periods applicable to the basis increases, and that tax rates applicable to us would be the same as they were in the year of the termination.\nDecisions made by Mr. Zugel (whether in his capacity as the trustee of the ZGH Class B Trust or as an officer of the Company) in the course of running our business, such as with respect to mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes in control, may influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by the ZGP Founder Members and the holders of Class B Units under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For example, the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction will generally accelerate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and increase the present value of such payments, and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction will increase an existing owner\u2019s tax liability without giving rise to any rights of the ZGP Founder Members or holders of Class B Units to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThere may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual income or franchise tax savings that the Company realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement or if distributions to the Company by ZGP are not sufficient to permit the Company to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement after it has paid taxes and other expenses. Furthermore, our obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, we may be required to make additional payments to the ZGP Founder Members under certain circumstances.\nIn the event that the ZGP Founder Members are required to recognize income or gain as a result of the release of the Additional Founder Units, we will be required to make a payment to the ZGP Founder Members under the Tax Receivable Agreement in an amount equal to 100% of any actual tax refunds or reductions in taxes otherwise payable that we realize as a result. Our obligation to make this additional payment does not terminate as a result of an early termination or change of control under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are expected to result from the acquisition of Units from the other ZGP members.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are entitled to retain 15% of the total tax savings we realize as a result of increases in tax basis created by exchanges of Units for Class A Common Stock or cash, and as a result of certain other tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Our ability to realize, and benefit from, these tax savings depends on a number of assumptions, including that we will earn sufficient taxable income each year during the period over which the deductions arising from any such basis increases and payments are available and that there are no adverse changes in applicable law or regulations. If our actual taxable income were insufficient to fully utilize such tax benefits or there were adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of these expected benefits and our cash flows and stockholders\u2019 equity could be negatively affected.\nOur public stockholders may experience dilution as a consequence of, among other transactions, the release of the Additional Founder Units or the issuance of any equity awards to our employees.\nIt is contemplated that, following the consummation of the Business Combination, up to 1,600,000 Class B Units will be issued to ZAIS employees. In addition, if certain conditions are satisfied, ZGP will be required to release 2,800,000 Additional Founder Units to the ZGP Founder Members and may issue 5,200,000 Additional Employee Units to ZAIS employees. The Company may also issue equity awards to ZAIS employees under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan that is proposed to be approved at our special meeting. The Company also has the ability to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock on terms and conditions established by our board of directors, subject only to the number of authorized shares in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Accordingly, current stockholders may experience substantial dilution. Such dilution could, among other things, limit the ability of our current stockholders to participate in the future earnings and growth of ZGP, if any, following the Business Combination.\nThe Class B Common Stock, the New LLC Agreement and other provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Class A Common Stock and could entrench management.\nThe concentrated voting power of the Class B Common Stock may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. In addition, after the consummation of the Business Combination, the ZGH Class B Trust, as the holder of the Class B Common Stock, will control the vote on all matters presented to our stockholders for a vote, including the election of directors. Under the New LLC Agreement, so long as the ZGP Founder Members own 10% of us on an as-exchanged basis, the ZGP Founder Members can veto a sale of the Class A Units that we hold, which would prevent many forms of a sale of the Company.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u00b7 authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock;\n\u00b7 provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of a majority or more of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of the Class A Common Stock.\nA change of control could result in termination of ZAIS\u2019s investment advisory and sub-investment advisory agreements.\nPursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \u201cAdvisers Act\u201d), each of ZAIS\u2019s investment advisory and sub-investment advisory agreements may not be \u201cassigned\u201d without the consent of the client. A sale of a controlling block of our voting securities and certain other transactions would be deemed an \u201cassignment\u201d pursuant to the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d). If such a deemed assignment occurs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary consents from clients and, unless the necessary approvals and consents are obtained, the deemed assignment could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s ability to continue managing client accounts, resulting in the loss of assets under management (\u201cAUM\u201d) and a corresponding loss of revenue.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Business Combination\nThe obligation of ZGP and the ZGP Founder Members to consummate the Business Combination is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions set forth in the Investment Agreement and failure to satisfy or waive any of these conditions may result in the Business Combination not being consummated.\nIn addition to obtaining shareholder approval for the Business Combination and our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, there are other conditions to obligations of ZGP and the ZGP Founder Members to consummate the Business Combination, many of which are outside of our control. For example, it is a condition of Closing of the Business Combination that we must have at least $100 million of cash in the Trust Account, after giving effect to the Redemption and Expense Payments when aggregated with other cash available to HF2 and proceeds of issuances of equity interests by ZGP on or promptly after the closing date of the Business Combination. In addition, consummation of the Business Combination is subject to prior receipt of certain approvals and consents required to be obtained from applicable governmental and regulatory authorities, which would include approval by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom. We and ZGP have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consents from governmental authorities and self-regulatory authorities. Our continued listing on the NASDAQ Market is another closing condition. In connection with the Business Combination, we must file a new initial listing application and meet NASDAQ\u2019s initial listing requirements as opposed to its more lenient continued listing requirements. There is no assurance that any of these closing conditions will be satisfied.\nWe may waive one or more of the conditions to the Business Combination.\nWe may agree to waive, in whole or in part, some of the conditions to our obligations to complete the Business Combination, to the extent permitted by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and applicable laws. For example, it is a condition to our obligations to close the Business Combination that there be no breach of ZGP\u2019s representations and warranties as of the closing date of the Business Combination. However, if our board of directors determines that any such breach is not material to the business of ZGP, then our board of directors may elect to waive that condition and close the Business Combination. We are not able to waive the condition that our public stockholders approve the Business Combination.\nThere are significant limitations on our right to make contractual indemnification claims against the ZGP Founder Members for the breach of any representations and warranties or covenants made by ZGP or the ZGP Founder Members in the Investment Agreement.\nOur ability to make contractual indemnification claims after the Closing of the Business Combination against the ZGP Founder Members under any circumstances, including for a breach of any representations and warranties or covenants made by ZGP or the ZGP Founder Members in the Investment Agreement, is subject to significant limitations. Our only recourse is against Class A Units held by the Founder Members on a several basis, and a maximum of $7.5 million of damages is recoverable through the Class A Units retained by the Founder Members at the Closing and we can claim only against the Additional Founder Units (which may never be released if the applicable Total Per Share Value Thresholds are not satisfied) for any remaining damages. Moreover, our ability to seek indemnification is subject to other material limitations, including in most cases a time period limit of 18 months after the Closing, satisfaction of a $750,000 deductible and a liability cap of $15 million. Finally, after the Business Combination, Mr. Zugel through his role as sole trustee of the ZGH Class B Trust and director and officer of the combined company will control the combined company. Although the Investment Agreement provides that consent of the independent directors of the combined company will be required to enforce our rights (or to decide not to enforce our rights) under the Investment Agreement, there is no assurance that the independent directors in exercising their business judgment will choose to enforce our indemnification and other rights under the Investment Agreement after the Closing.\nSubsequent to the consummation of the Business Combination, we may be required to take writedowns or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough we have conducted due diligence on ZGP, we cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that may be present in ZGP\u2019s business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of our and ZGP\u2019s control will not later arise. As a result, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure ZGP\u2019s operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the combined company or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nOur Sponsors, directors and officers have agreed to vote in favor of the Business Combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote.\nUnlike certain other blank check companies in which the founders agree to vote their shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by the public stockholders in connection with an initial business combination, our Sponsors, directors and officers have agreed to vote any shares of Class A Common Stock owned by them in favor of the Business Combination. Currently, our Sponsors, directors and officers own 30.5% of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. As a result, because approval of the Business Combination requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock that are voted, rather than a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, the Business Combination will be approved unless public stockholders holding shares in excess of 30.5% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock vote against the Business Combination.\nActivities taken by our affiliates to purchase, directly or indirectly, public shares will increase the likelihood of approval of the Business Combination and other proposals presented at our special meeting.\nIf a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against the Business Combination or to seek redemption of their shares, our Sponsors, officers, directors or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in order to influence the vote or to reduce the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that may exercise redemption rights to the extent permitted by law. The purpose of such arrangements would be to increase the likelihood that our stockholders approve the Business Combination and the amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or to increase the likelihood of satisfaction of the requirement that we have available at least $100 million, after giving effect to the Redemption and the Expense Payments, for the Closing Acquisition Consideration. Certain of our Sponsors have expressed an interest in possibly purchasing, either directly or through their affiliates, between 2,000,000 and 5,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in the aggregate in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination. All public shares purchased by our Sponsors, officers, directors or their affiliates pursuant to such arrangements would be voted in favor of the Business Combination and the amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and would not be redeemed.\nOur directors and officers have a conflict of interest in determining to pursue the investment in ZGP, since certain of their interests, and certain interests of their affiliates and associates, are different from or in addition to (and which may conflict with) the interests of our stockholders.\nOur Sponsors, officers and directors have interests in and arising from the Business Combination that are different from or in addition to (and which may conflict with) the interests of our public stockholders, which may result in a conflict of interest. These interests may influence our directors in making their recommendation that you vote in favor of the Business Combination, and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nWe will incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the Business Combination.\nWe expect to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the Business Combination. Generally, if the Business Combination does not close, all legal, accounting, investment banking and other fees, expenses and costs incurred in connection with trying to consummate the Business Combination will be paid by the party incurring such fees, expenses and costs. After the Closing, all of HF2\u2019s fees, costs and expenses related to the Business Combination will be borne by ZGP.\nHF2\u2019s transaction expenses as a result of the Business Combination are currently estimated at approximately $9.7 million, which is comprised of (i) a $7.0 million advisory fee split between EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners, L.P., and (ii) $2.7 million of other expenses including, but not limited to, legal, accounting and consulting services and costs incurred with the filing, printing and mailing of the proxy statement for our special meeting and the solicitation of the approval of our stockholders. If our transaction expenses exceed $10 million, then additional Class A Units will be issued to the ZGP Founder Members, which will decrease our ownership of ZGP.\nRisk Factors Relating to HF2 and Class A Common Stock After the Business Combination\nWe will incur increased costs and become subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of becoming a public operating company, which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that historically have not been incurred by ZGP as a closely held business, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ. The expenses incurred by public operating companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. These laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nIf the Business Combination\u2019s benefits do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of our securities may decline.\nFollowing the Business Combination, the price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction to the Business Combination and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities following the Business Combination may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. If the benefits of the Business Combination do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of the Class A Common Stock prior to the Closing of the Business Combination may decline. The market values of the Class A Common Stock at the time of the Business Combination may vary significantly from the trading price of the Class A Common Stock on the date the Investment Agreement was executed or the date on which our stockholders vote on the Business Combination.\nIn addition, following the Business Combination, fluctuations in the price of the Class A Common Stock could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. There is no public market for ZGP\u2019s Units and trading in the shares of Class A Common Stock has not been active. Accordingly, the valuation ascribed to ZGP and the Class A Common Stock in the Business Combination may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market following the Business Combination. If an active market for the Class A Common Stock develops and continues, the trading price of the Class A Common Stock following the Business Combination could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nFactors affecting the trading price of the Class A Common Stock following the Business Combination may include:\n\u00b7 our inability to realize the benefits of the Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably, and retain its management and key employees;\n\u00b7 the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us, ZGP or others in connection with the Business Combination;\n\u00b7 the inability to meet NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements;\n\u00b7 the risk that the Business Combination disrupts current plans and operations of us or ZGP and its subsidiaries as a result of the announcement and consummation of the Business Combination;\n\u00b7 costs related to the Business Combination and the integration of ZAIS;\n\u00b7 changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of AUM;\n\u00b7 the annual or quarterly results of operations or financial condition of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 the relative and absolute investment performance of advised or sponsored investment products;\n\u00b7 the impact of capital improvement projects;\n\u00b7 the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u00b7 the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings;\n\u00b7 the extent and timing of any share repurchases;\n\u00b7 the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property protection;\n\u00b7 the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to us or ZGP or its subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 terrorist activities and international hostilities, which may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and us or ZGP and its subsidiaries;\n\u00b7 the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; and\n\u00b7 the impact of changes to tax legislation and, generally, our tax position.\nBroad market and industry factors and general economic conditions may also materially harm the market price of the Class A Common Stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock markets, in general, and NASDAQ, in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. A loss of investor confidence in the market for investment management stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress the price of the Class A Common Stock regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations.\nAny of the above described factors or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on your investment in the Class A Common Stock. In such circumstances, the trading price of the Class A Common Stock may not recover and may experience a further decline. A decline in the market price of the Class A Common Stock also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nFollowing the Business Combination, if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our industry, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the Class A Common Stock, the price and trading volume of the Class A Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for the Class A Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our industry, or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the price and trading volume of the Class A Common Stock would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding the Class A Common Stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of the Class A Common Stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of the Class A Common Stock to decline.\nNASDAQ may delist our shares which could limit investors\u2019 ability to trade our shares and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOn September 5, 2014, we received notice from The NASDAQ Stock Market that we are not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) because we have less than 300 \u201cpublic holders.\u201d NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) requires listed companies to maintain at least 300 \u201cpublic holders\u201d which includes beneficial holders and holders of record, but does not include any holder who is, either directly or indirectly, an executive officer, director, or the beneficial holder of more than 10% of the total shares outstanding. The notice received from NASDAQ does not immediately result in the delisting of the Class A Common Stock from The NASDAQ Capital Market. On October 17, 2014, we submitted a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(3). The plan was accepted by NASDAQ, and NASDAQ granted us an extension until March 4, 2015 to complete the Business Combination, demonstrate compliance with all initial listing requirements and regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(3). There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with NASDAQ\u2019s requirements by March 4, 2015.\nOn January 2, 2015, we received notice from NASDAQ that NASDAQ has concluded that we have not complied with NASDAQ Listing Rules 5620(a) and 5620(b) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 and has determined to initiate procedures to delist our Class A Common Stock from NASDAQ. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5620(a) requires each company to hold an annual meeting of shareholders no later than one year after the end of the company\u2019s fiscal year-end. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5620(b) requires each company to solicit proxies and provide proxy statements for all meetings of shareholders and provide copies of such proxy solicitation to NASDAQ. A subsequent notice from NASDAQ received by us on January 5, 2015 stated that ours failure to comply with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(3) serves as an additional basis for delisting. The notices received from NASDAQ do not immediately result in the delisting of our Class A Common Stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market. Under NASDAQ rules, we may request a hearing to appeal NASDAQ\u2019s determination to a Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d). We submitted a request for a hearing on January 9, 2015, and a hearing is scheduled for February 19, 2015. The failure to comply with NASDAQ Listing Rules 5620(a), 5620(b) and 5550(a)(3) will be addressed in our appeal. Submission of the request for a hearing will stay the suspension of the trading of our Class A Common Stock in the period before the Panel renders a decision, and our Class A Common Stock will continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market in that period. There can be no assurance our appeal will be successful or we will be able to maintain our listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nIf NASDAQ delists our shares of Class A Common Stock, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our shares;\n\u00b7 reduced price and liquidity with respect to our shares which may materially limit your ability to sell shares of Class A Common Stock;\n\u00b7 a determination that the Class A Common Stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe market price of the Class A Common Stock may decline due to the large number of shares of Class A Common Stock eligible for exchange and future sale.\nThe market price of shares of the Class A Common Stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Class A Common Stock in the market after the Business Combination or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares of Class A Common Stock in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nOur Sponsors are entitled to make a demand that we register the resale of the Founders\u2019 Shares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may be released from escrow, which, subject to certain exceptions, will be one year after the consummation of the Business Combination. Additionally, our Sponsors are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the Sponsors\u2019 Shares and any shares our Sponsors, officers, directors, Advisory Board members or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us commencing on the date that we consummate the Business Combination. The presence of these additional shares of Class A Common Stock trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Class A Common Stock.\nPursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement that we will enter into in connection with the Business Combination, holders of Units can demand that we register the resale of shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon the exchange of Class A Units and vested Class B Units of ZGP. Although there are timing and other limitations on these exchanges as set forth in the Exchange Agreement, the possibility that these exchanges may occur may adversely impact the trading price of the Class A Common Stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our shares of Class A Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act (the \u201cJOBS ACT\u201d), enacted in April 2012, and will continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d following the Closing of the Business Combination. For as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d We are currently, and in the future anticipate, taking advantage of these exemptions that do not require us to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, provide the full disclosure regarding executive compensation that would otherwise be needed in our periodic reports and proxy statements, hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation or shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 31, 2018, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of the Class A Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any January 31 before the end of that five-year period, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this provision, and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe cannot predict whether investors will find the Class A Common Stock less attractive because we have chosen to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the Class A Common Stock less attractive as a result of any decisions to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for the Class A Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUpon the listing of our shares on the NASDAQ, we will qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ\u2019s rules and, as a result, will qualify for, and may choose to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. In such a circumstance, you would not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nAfter completion of the Business Combination, the ZGH Class B Trust will hold approximately 89.4%, assuming no Redemptions of shares of our Class A Common Stock, or 92.4%, assuming 7,142,857 shares of our Class A Common Stock are redeemed, of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. As a result, we will qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power in the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements. For example, controlled companies:\n\u00b7 are not required to have a board that is composed of a majority of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under the rules of such exchange;\n\u00b7 are not required to have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u00b7 are not required to have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nAlthough we do not currently intend to use this exemption, we may choose to do so in the future. In such an event, a majority of the directors on our board will not be required to be independent. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ. Being a controlled company may also adversely impact the trading price of the Class A Common Stock.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete the Business Combination.\nA company that, among other things, is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, trading or holding certain types of securities would be deemed an investment company under the 1940 Act. If we are deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act, we may be subject to certain restrictions that may make it more difficult for us to complete the Business Combination, including restrictions on the nature of our investments and the issuance of securities. In addition, we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements, including registration as an investment company, adoption of a specific form of corporate structure and reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations. Compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense.\nA portion of ZAIS\u2019s revenue and cash flow is variable, which may impact ZAIS\u2019s ability to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause volatility of Class A Common Stock.\nAlthough ZAIS believes that a portion of its revenue is consistent and recurring due to ZAIS\u2019s investment strategy and the nature of ZAIS\u2019s fees, a portion of ZAIS\u2019s revenue and cash flow is variable, primarily due to the fact that the performance fees from ZAIS\u2019s funds can vary from year to year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, performance fees were 68.7% of ZAIS\u2019s total revenues, representing a 38.1% increase over the year ended December 31, 2013. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, performance fees were 49.9% and 76.7% of ZAIS\u2019s total revenues, respectively. Additionally, ZAIS may also experience fluctuations in ZAIS\u2019s results from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of other factors, including changes in the values of ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 investments, changes in ZAIS\u2019s operating expenses, the degree to which it encounters competition and general economic and market conditions. Such variability may lead to volatility in the trading price of Class A Common Stock. Moreover, ZAIS\u2019s results for a particular period are not indicative of ZAIS\u2019s performance in a future period.\nPotential conflicts of interest may arise between holders of Class A Common Stock and ZAIS\u2019s fund investors.\nAs an investment adviser, ZAIS has certain fiduciary duties or contractual obligations to the funds that it manages. As a result, it expects to regularly take actions with respect to the purchase or sale of investments in ZAIS\u2019s funds, the structuring of investment transactions for the funds or otherwise in a manner consistent with such duties and obligations but that might at the same time adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s near-term results of operations or cash flows. This may in turn have an adverse effect on the price of Class A Common Stock or on the interests of holders of Class A Common Stock. Additionally, to the extent ZAIS fails to appropriately deal with any such conflicts of interest, it could negatively impact ZAIS\u2019s reputation and ability to raise additional funds.\nZAIS\u2019s use of leverage to finance its business will expose ZAIS to substantial risks, which are exacerbated by ZAIS\u2019s funds' use of leverage to finance investments.\nZAIS may eventually use a significant amount of borrowings to finance ZAIS\u2019s business operations as a public company and the use of leverage will be required to effectuate certain of ZAIS\u2019s growth initiatives. That will expose ZAIS to the typical risks associated with the use of substantial leverage, including those discussed above under \u201c- Dependence on leverage by certain of ZAIS\u2019s funds subjects them to volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\u201d These risks are exacerbated by ZAIS\u2019s funds' use of leverage to finance investments.\nThe Business Combination may adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s ability to retain and motivate its senior management team, senior investment professionals and other key personnel and to recruit, retain and motivate new senior professionals and other key personnel, both of which could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s business, results and financial condition.\nZAIS\u2019s future success and growth depend to a substantial degree on its ability to retain and motivate its senior management team, senior investment professionals and other professionals and to strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel, including new senior professionals. Within the next 12 months, it is anticipated that members of ZAIS\u2019s senior management team and investment professionals will begin to receive a significant percentage of their compensation in the form of shares of Class A Common Stock in lieu of cash, which may reduce their overall compensation depending upon our stock price performance. The replacement of any of these key individuals would involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of ZAIS\u2019s business objectives.\nIn order to recruit and retain existing and future senior professionals, ZAIS may need to increase the level of compensation that it pays to them. Accordingly, as ZAIS promotes or hires new senior professionals over time, it may increase the level of compensation it pays to them, which would cause ZAIS\u2019s total employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of ZAIS\u2019s total revenue to increase and adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s profitability. In addition, issuance of equity interests in ZAIS\u2019s business to future senior professionals would dilute public stockholders.\nZAIS believes that it has a workplace culture of collaboration, motivation and alignment of interests with investors. The effects of the Business Combination, including potential changes in ZAIS\u2019s compensation structure, could adversely affect this culture. If ZAIS does not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage ZAIS\u2019s changing enterprise and maintain this culture, ZAIS\u2019s ability to compete successfully and achieve ZAIS\u2019s business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact ZAIS\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInvestors in ZAIS\u2019s funds may be unwilling to commit new capital to, and may withdraw capital from, ZAIS\u2019s funds as a result of the Business Combination, which could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s business and financial condition.\nSome investors in ZAIS\u2019s funds may view negatively the prospect of a publicly traded company becoming the majority equity owner and managing member of ZAIS\u2019s parent company, ZGP, and may have concerns that as a result of the Business Combination ZAIS\u2019s attention will be bifurcated between investors in ZAIS\u2019s funds and HF2\u2019s public stockholders, resulting in potential conflicts of interest. Some investors in ZAIS\u2019s funds may believe that ZAIS will strive for near-term profit instead of superior risk-adjusted returns for investors in ZAIS\u2019s funds over time or grow ZAIS\u2019s AUM for the purpose of generating additional management fees without regard to whether ZAIS believes there are sufficient investment opportunities to effectively deploy the additional capital. There can be no assurance that ZAIS will be successful in its efforts to address such concerns or to convince investors in ZAIS\u2019s funds that ZAIS\u2019s decision to pursue the Business Combination will not affect ZAIS\u2019s longstanding priorities or the way ZAIS conduct its businesses. A decision by a significant number of investors in ZAIS\u2019s funds not to commit additional capital to ZAIS\u2019s funds or to cease doing business with ZAIS altogether could inhibit ZAIS\u2019s ability to achieve ZAIS\u2019s investment objectives and may have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s business and financial condition.\nRisk Factors Relating to Redemptions\nIt is a condition to the Closing of the Business Combination that we have at least $100 million in the Trust Account, after giving effect to Redemptions and the Expense Payments, when aggregated with other cash available to HF2 and proceeds of equity issuances by ZGP on or promptly after the closing date of the Business Combination. Accordingly, unless this provision is waived, we may be unable to consummate the Business Combination if there are substantial Redemptions by our public stockholders.\nIt is a condition to the Closing of the Business Combination under the Investment Agreement that we have at least $100 million in the Trust Account at Closing, after giving effect to Redemptions and the Expense Payments, when aggregated with other cash available to HF2 and proceeds of equity issuances by ZGP. Each redemption of public shares by our public stockholders will decrease the amount in the Trust Account, which is $184,754,364 as of December 31, 2014. If redemptions by our public stockholders cause us to have less than $100 million in the Trust Account at the Closing of the Business Combination, when aggregated with other cash available to HF2 and proceeds of equity issuances by ZGP, we will not be able to consummate the Business Combination unless ZGP and the ZGP Founder Members waive this condition. Even if ZGP and the ZGP Founder Members provide such a waiver, we are further limited by the requirement to have at least $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation of the Business Combination after giving effect to the Redemption and the Expense Payments. As a result of these limitations, we may not be able to consummate the Business Combination even though holders of a majority of our public shares have voted in favor of the Business Combination.\nOur public stockholders may exercise their Redemption rights even if they vote in favor of the Business Combination, which could result in a less liquid trading market for the Class A Common Stock, fewer stockholders, less cash and the potential inability to meeting the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market.\nOur public stockholders may exercise their Redemption rights even if they vote in favor of the Business Combination. As a result, the Business Combination can be approved by public stockholders who will redeem their shares and no longer remain stockholders, leaving stockholders who choose not to redeem their shares holding shares in a company with a less liquid trading market, fewer stockholders, less cash and the potential inability to meet the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market.\nPublic stockholders, together with any affiliates of theirs or any other person with whom they are acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup,\u201d will be restricted from seeking Redemption rights with respect to more than 20% of the shares sold in our IPO.\nWe will offer each public stockholder (but not our Sponsors, officers and directors) the right to request to have his, her, or its shares of Class A Common Stock redeemed for cash in connection with the Closing of the Business Combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d, will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than 20% of the shares of Class A Common Stock sold in our IPO. Generally, in this context, a stockholder will be deemed to be acting in concert or as a group with another stockholder when such stockholders agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring, voting, holding or disposing of our equity securities. Accordingly, if you purchased more than 20% of the shares sold in our IPO and the Business Combination is approved, you will not be able to seek Redemption rights with respect to the full amount of your public shares and may be forced to hold such additional public shares or sell them in the open market. The price you obtain on the open market may be less than the Redemption Price.\nThere is no guarantee that a stockholder\u2019s decision whether to redeem its shares for the Redemption Price will put the stockholder in a better future economic position.\nWe can give no assurance as to the price at which a stockholder may be able to sell its shares in the future following the completion of the Business Combination. Certain events following the consummation of the Business Combination may cause an increase in the price of the Class A Common Stock. If the price of the Class A Common Stock exceeds the Redemption Price, a redeeming stockholder may realize lower value than if it had held the shares. Conversely, if a stockholder does not redeem its shares, the stockholder will bear the risk of ownership of the shares after the consummation of the Business Combination, and there can be no assurance that a stockholder will be able to sell its shares of Class A Common Stock in the future for a greater amount than the Redemption Price. A stockholder should consult its own tax or financial advisor for assistance on how this may affect its individual situation.\nIf our stockholders fail to comply with the Redemption requirements specified in our definitive proxy statement for the special meeting, they will not be entitled to redeem their shares of Class A Common Stock for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account.\nIn order for a public stockholder to exercise his Redemption rights, he must follow the instructions set forth in our definitive proxy statement (i) affirmatively vote either for or against the Business Combination, (ii) check the box on the proxy card to elect redemption, (iii) check the box on the proxy card marked \u201cShareholder Certification\u201d to certify that he is not part of a group seeking Redemption rights with respect to more than 20% of the shares of Class A Common Stock sold in our IPO, and (iv) prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on February 13, 2015 (three business days before the special meeting), (x) submit a written request to our transfer agent that we redeem his public shares for cash, and (y) deliver his stock to our transfer agent either physically or electronically through the DTC DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System. For a stockholder who holds his shares in \u201cstreet name\u201d, a stockholder\u2019s broker or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, this may not be the case. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate for stockholders to deliver their shares, public stockholders who wish to redeem may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their Redemption rights and thus may be unable to redeem their public shares.\nPublic stockholders who wish to redeem their shares and comply with specific requirements for Redemption may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event the Business Combination is not approved.\nWe will require public stockholders who wish to redeem their public shares to deliver their shares either physically or electronically, and if the Business Combination is not consummated we will promptly return such shares, either electronically or physically, to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly, public stockholders who attempted to redeem their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their public shares after the failed acquisition until we have returned their shares to them. The market price for shares of Class A Common Stock may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your shares of Class A Common Stock when you wish to, even while other public stockholders that did not seek Redemption may be able to sell their shares.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Failure to Consummate the Business Combination\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph that discusses the mandatory liquidation of the Company if a business combination is not consummated and expresses doubt about our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\nIf we do not consummate the Business Combination by March 21, 2015, the Company will be liquidated and will no longer be a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this filing do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to consummate the Business Combination.\nWe will have insufficient time to complete an alternate business combination if the Business Combination or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is not approved by our stockholders or the Business Combination is otherwise not completed.\nPursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in the event we do not consummate a business combination by March 21, 2015, we are required to cease operations and begin the dissolution process provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Therefore, if the Business Combination or (unless waived by ZGP or the ZGP Founder Members) our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is not approved by our stockholders, we will not complete the Business Combination and will not be able to complete an alternative business combination by March 21, 2015. If this occurs, we will be required to commence a process to dissolve and distribute our assets.\nIn addition to liquidation, failure to complete the Business Combination will negatively affect the Company.\nIf the Business Combination is not consummated, it is likely that we will be forced to liquidate. Moreover, we will still be required to pay fees, expenses and costs relating to the Business Combination including fees and expenses relating to legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees. Our management has also devoted substantial time and resources to the Business Combination, which otherwise could have been devoted to seeking another business combination. We also could be subject to litigation related to a failure to complete the Business Combination or to enforce our rights under the Investment Agreement.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\nIf we have not completed the Business Combination by March 21, 2015, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including any interest but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (except for the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and to the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following March 21, 2015 and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the three year period of time in which a claim could have been made against our stockholders if we complied with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. We may not properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. Accordingly, third parties may seek to recover from our stockholders amounts owed to them by us.\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor, creditor or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, if there is a liquidation, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the Trust Account to our public stockholders promptly after March 21, 2015, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duties to our creditors or to have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share liquidation price received by stockholders may be less than $10.50.\nOur placing of funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although most of our vendors and service providers have executed agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, our vendors and service providers may still seek recourse against the Trust Account. ZGP and the ZGP Founder Members have also agreed to this type of waiver provision in the Investment Agreement. However, a court may not uphold the validity of such waiver agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to claims which could take priority over those of our public stockholders. Therefore, if we do not consummate an initial business combination, the per-share distribution from the Trust Account may be less than $10.50, due to such claims.\nAdditionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we may not be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.50.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our officers, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public stockholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below $10.50 per public share and Bruce Cameron, Bradley Forth or the estate of Richard Foote asserts that he or it is unable to satisfy his or its obligations or that he or it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against such individual to enforce such indemnification obligations. It is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.50 per share.\nThe following risk factors apply to the business and operations of ZGP and its consolidated subsidiaries, which will also apply to the business and operations of the combined company following the completion of the Business Combination, and to HF2 and the Business Combination.\nRisks Related to ZGP\u2019s and ZAIS\u2019s Business and Industry\nDifficult market and political conditions may adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s business, including by reducing the value or hampering the performance of the investments made by ZAIS\u2019s funds, accounts and investment products each of which could materially and adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nZAIS\u2019s business is materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political conditions throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability and cost of credit, inflation or deflation, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to ZAIS\u2019s taxation, taxation of ZAIS\u2019s investors, the possibility of changes to tax laws in either the United States or any non-U.S. jurisdiction and regulations on asset managers), trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts and security operations). These factors are outside of ZAIS\u2019s control and may affect the level and volatility of asset prices and the liquidity and value of investments and ZAIS may not be able to or may choose not to manage its exposure to these conditions. Ongoing developments in the U.S. and global financial markets following the unprecedented turmoil in the global capital markets and the financial services industry in late 2008 and early 2009 continue to illustrate that the current environment is still one of uncertainty and instability for investment management businesses. These and other conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy may result in adverse consequences for ZAIS\u2019s funds, accounts and investment products (collectively referred to as \u201cfunds\u201d herein) and their respective investee companies, which could restrict such funds\u2019 investment activities and impede such funds\u2019 ability to effectively achieve their investment objectives.\nIn the event of a market downturn, each of ZAIS\u2019s businesses could be affected in different ways. ZAIS\u2019s funds may face reduced opportunities to sell and realize value from their existing investments, and a lack of suitable investments for the funds to make. In addition, adverse market or economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the returns of the funds that ZAIS manages, and, therefore, ZAIS\u2019s earnings. A general market downturn, or a specific market dislocation, may cause ZAIS\u2019s revenue and results of operations to decline by causing:\n\u00b7 the net asset value or the AUM of ZAIS managed funds to decrease, lowering management fees;\n\u00b7 lower investment returns, reducing incentive income; and\n\u00b7 investor redemptions, resulting in lower fees.\nFurthermore, while difficult market conditions may increase opportunities to make certain distressed asset investments, such conditions also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by ZAIS\u2019s funds with debt investments. The attractiveness of ZAIS\u2019s funds relative to other investment products could decrease depending on economic conditions. ZAIS\u2019s funds may also be adversely affected by difficult market conditions if ZAIS fails to predict the adverse effect of such conditions on particular investments, resulting in a significant reduction in the value of those investments.\nThe investment management business is competitive.\nThe investment management business is highly competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, business relationships, quality of service provided to investors, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, fund terms (including fees), brand recognition and business reputation. ZAIS competes for investors with other investment managers, public and private funds, business development companies, small business investment companies and others. Numerous factors increase ZAIS\u2019s competitive risks, including:\n\u00b7 a number of ZAIS\u2019s competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than ZAIS does;\n\u00b7 some of ZAIS\u2019s funds may not perform as well as competitors\u2019 funds or other available investment products;\n\u00b7 a number of ZAIS\u2019s competitors have raised significant amounts of capital, and some of them have similar investment objectives to ZAIS\u2019s, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that otherwise could be exploited;\n\u00b7 some of ZAIS\u2019s competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding resources that are not available to ZAIS, which may create competitive disadvantages for ZAIS\u2019s funds;\n\u00b7 some of ZAIS\u2019s competitors may be subject to less regulation and, accordingly, may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than ZAIS does or bear less compliance expense than ZAIS does;\n\u00b7 some of ZAIS\u2019s competitors may have more flexibility than ZAIS has in raising certain types of funds under the investment management contracts they have negotiated with their investors;\n\u00b7 some of ZAIS\u2019s competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by investors as having better expertise than ZAIS in a specific asset class or geographic region; and\n\u00b7 other industry participants may, from time to time, seek to recruit ZAIS\u2019s investment professionals and other employees away from ZAIS.\nThis competitive pressure could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s ability to make successful investments and limit ZAIS\u2019s ability to raise future funds, either of which would adversely impact ZAIS\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nZAIS\u2019s AUM has been subject to volatility.\nHistorically, ZAIS\u2019s AUM has fluctuated from time to time. ZAIS\u2019s AUM has declined significantly from its peak of $11.7 billion prior to the financial crisis in 2008 to $4.7 billion as of September 30, 2014, largely attributable to the return of investor capital from certain private equity style funds, the termination of certain collateralized debt obligations (\u201cCDOs\u201d) managed by ZAIS, certain investor redemptions and the challenges of raising significant new assets to replace those assets being returned to investors. These challenges stem largely from structured credit products being disfavored by investors in the continuing low interest rate environment. In this environment, investor inflows have gravitated toward equity and macro managers during 2014 as interest rates remained relatively flat, a trend that will likely continue until interest rates rise to a level presenting more attractive yields.\nFurther, ZAIS currently has additional funds representing total AUM of approximately $1.1 billion that are winding down and are in liquidation. If ZAIS is unable to raise significant new assets to replace those that will be returned to investors its AUM would be subject to further decline resulting in a lower base of assets on which it charges management fees and may receive incentive income. This, in turn, would negatively impact ZAIS\u2019s revenue and results of operations.\nZAIS derives a substantial portion of its revenues from funds managed pursuant to advisory agreements that may be terminated.\nThe applicable investment advisory agreement for each of ZAIS\u2019s funds may permit the investors of each respective fund to remove ZAIS as investment manager in certain circumstances. ZAIS\u2019s managed accounts are governed by investment management agreements that may be terminated by investors, generally upon little or no notice and with or without cause, as set forth in the applicable agreement. Termination of these agreements would negatively affect ZAIS\u2019s revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s results of operations.\nZAIS may not be able to maintain its current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees, which could have an adverse effect on its profit margins and results of operations.\nZAIS may not be able to maintain its current fee structure as a result of industry pressure from fund investors to reduce fees. Although ZAIS\u2019s investment management fees vary among and within asset classes, historically it has competed primarily on the basis of its performance and not on the level of its investment management fees relative to those of its competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a general trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry. More recently, institutional investors have been allocating increasing amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies as well as attempting to reduce management fees and incentive income to external managers, whether through direct reductions, deferrals or rebates. ZAIS\u2019s average management fees charged with respect to certain asset types has declined as a result of this industry pressure towards lower fees. Although ZAIS has no obligation to modify any of its fees with respect to its existing funds, it may experience pressure to do so. No assurance can be made that ZAIS will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow ZAIS to maintain its current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future businesses could have an adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s profit margins and results of operations.\nThe historical returns attributable to ZAIS\u2019s funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of ZAIS or any of its funds or of ZAIS\u2019s future results or of any returns expected on an investment in Class A Common Stock.\nAn investment in Class A Common Stock is not an investment in any of ZAIS\u2019s funds. The historical performance of ZAIS\u2019s funds is relevant to ZAIS primarily insofar as it is indicative of fees it has earned in the past and may earn in the future and ZAIS\u2019s reputation and ability to raise new funds. The historical and potential returns of the funds it advises will not, however, be directly linked to returns on Class A Common Stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that positive performance of the funds ZAIS advises will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in Class A Common Stock, nor should you conclude that ZAIS\u2019s prior fund performance is indicative of the future results of ZAIS\u2019s funds. Poor future performance of the funds ZAIS advises could cause a decline in ZAIS\u2019s revenues and could therefore have a negative effect on ZAIS\u2019s operating results and returns on the Class A Common Stock.\nMoreover, the historical returns of ZAIS\u2019s funds should not be considered indicative of the future returns of these funds or from any future funds it may raise, in part because:\n\u00b7 market conditions during previous periods may have been significantly more favorable for generating positive performance than the market conditions ZAIS may experience in the future;\n\u00b7 ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 returns have previously benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not recur, and ZAIS\u2019s funds may not be able to achieve the same returns or profitable investment opportunities or deploy capital as quickly;\n\u00b7 some of ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 rates of returns are calculated on the basis of market value of the funds\u2019 investments, including unrealized gains, which may never be realized;\n\u00b7 the historical returns that are presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K derive largely from the performance of ZAIS\u2019s earlier funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of ZAIS\u2019s more recently formed funds that may have little or no realized investment track record or funds that have not yet been formed;\n\u00b7 you will not benefit from any value that was created in ZAIS\u2019s funds prior to ZAIS\u2019s becoming a public company if such value was previously realized;\n\u00b7 in recent years, there has been increased competition for investment opportunities resulting from the increased amount of capital invested in alternative funds and high liquidity in debt markets, and the increased competition for investments may reduce ZAIS\u2019s returns in the future; and\n\u00b7 ZAIS\u2019s newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they take to deploy their capital.\nThe future internal rate of return for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical internal rate of return generated by any particular fund, or for ZAIS\u2019s funds as a whole. Future returns will also be affected by the risks described elsewhere in this prospectus, including risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular fund invests.\nPoor performance of ZAIS\u2019s funds would cause a decline in ZAIS\u2019s revenue and results of operations, and would adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s ability to raise capital for future funds.\nZAIS\u2019s revenue is derived principally from two sources: (1) management fee income, based on the size of ZAIS\u2019s funds and (2) incentive income, based on the performance of ZAIS\u2019s funds. Although ZAIS believes that a portion of its revenue is consistent and recurring due to ZAIS\u2019s investment strategy and the nature of ZAIS\u2019s fees, a portion of ZAIS\u2019s revenue and cash flow is variable, primarily due to the fact that the performance fees from ZAIS\u2019s funds can vary from year to year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, performance fees were 68.7% of ZAIS\u2019s total revenues, representing a 38.1% increase over the year ended December 31, 2013. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, performance fees were 49.9% and 76.7% of ZAIS\u2019s total revenues, respectively. In the event that any of ZAIS\u2019s funds perform poorly, ZAIS\u2019s revenue and results of operations will decline, and it will likely be more difficult for ZAIS to raise new capital. In addition, fund investors may withdraw their investments in ZAIS\u2019s funds as a result of poor performance of ZAIS\u2019s funds or otherwise. ZAIS\u2019s investors and potential investors continually assess ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 performance and ZAIS\u2019s ability to raise capital.\nEmployee misconduct could harm ZAIS by impairing ZAIS\u2019s ability to attract and retain investors and subjecting ZAIS to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nZAIS\u2019s ability to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for ZAIS\u2019s funds depends heavily upon the reputation of ZAIS\u2019s professionals, especially ZAIS\u2019s senior professionals. ZAIS is subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from ZAIS\u2019s investment management business and ZAIS\u2019s authority over the assets managed by ZAIS\u2019s investment management business. Violation of these obligations and standards by any of ZAIS\u2019s employees could adversely affect investors in ZAIS\u2019s funds and us. ZAIS\u2019s businesses often require that it deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which ZAIS\u2019s funds may invest and the investors in the funds. If ZAIS\u2019s employees were to use or disclose confidential information improperly, ZAIS could suffer serious harm to its reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct, and the extensive precautions ZAIS takes to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If one or more of ZAIS\u2019s employees were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, ZAIS\u2019s businesses and ZAIS\u2019s reputation could be adversely affected and a loss of investor confidence could result, which would adversely impact ZAIS\u2019s ability to raise future funds.\nZAIS may be subject to financial criminal activity which could result in financial loss or damage to ZAIS\u2019s reputation.\nInstances of financial criminal activity, personal trading violations and other abuses, including misappropriation of assets by internal or external perpetrators, may arise despite ZAIS\u2019s internal control policies and procedures. Instances of such criminal activity by financial firms and their personnel, including those in the investment management industry, have led the U.S. government and regulators to increase enforcement of existing rules relating to such activities, adopt new rules and regulations and enhance oversight of the U.S. financial industry. As ZAIS expands its international operations, it will be subject to the rules of other jurisdictions that govern and control financial criminal activities and exposed to financial criminal activities on a more global scale. Compliance with existing and new rules and regulations may have the effect of increasing ZAIS\u2019s expenses. Further, should any of ZAIS\u2019s or ZAIS\u2019s personnel be linked to financial criminal activity, either domestically or internationally, ZAIS would suffer material damage to its reputation which could result in a corresponding loss of clients, client assets and revenue.\nZAIS is vulnerable to reputational harm because it operates in an industry in which personal relationships, integrity and client confidence are of critical importance. For example, if an employee were to engage in illegal or suspicious activities, ZAIS could be subject to legal or regulatory sanctions and suffer serious reputational harm (as a consequence of the negative perception resulting from such activities), and impairment to client relationships and the ability to attract new clients. ZAIS\u2019s business often requires that it deal with confidential information. If any of ZAIS\u2019s employees were to improperly use or disclose this information, even if inadvertently, it could be subject to legal or regulatory action and suffer serious harm to ZAIS\u2019s reputation and current and future business relationships.\nReputational harm could result in a loss of AUM and revenues.\nThe integrity of ZAIS\u2019s brand is critical to ZAIS\u2019s ability to attract and retain clients, business partners and employees and maintain relationships with consultants. ZAIS operates within the highly regulated financial services industry and various potential scenarios could result in harm to ZAIS\u2019s reputation. They include internal operational failures, failure to follow investment or legal guidelines in the management of accounts, intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of ZAIS\u2019s products and services in offering or advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications, employee misconduct (including prohibited postings on social media) or investments in businesses or industries that are controversial to certain special interest groups. The negative publicity associated with any of these factors could harm ZAIS\u2019s reputation and adversely impact relationships with existing and potential clients, third-party distributors, consultants and other business partners and subject ZAIS to regulatory sanctions. Damage to ZAIS\u2019s brands or reputation would negatively impact ZAIS\u2019s standing in the industry and result in loss of business in both the short term and the long term.\nA significant portion of ZAIS\u2019s AUM is or may be derived from a small number of clients, the loss of which could significantly reduce ZAIS\u2019s management fees and have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s results of operations.\nCertain of ZAIS\u2019s strategies are or may derive a significant portion of their total AUM from assets of a single client or a small number of clients. As of September 30, 2014, two investors accounted for approximately 27% of ZAIS\u2019s AUM and ZAIS\u2019s 10 largest investors accounted for approximately 55% of ZAIS\u2019s AUM. If any such clients withdraw all or a portion of their AUM, ZAIS\u2019s business would be significantly affected, which would negatively impact ZAIS\u2019s management fees and could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nZAIS\u2019s failure to comply with investment guidelines set by its clients and limitations imposed by applicable law could result in damage awards against ZAIS and a loss of ZAIS\u2019s AUM, either of which could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nCertain clients who retain ZAIS to manage assets on their behalf specify guidelines regarding investment allocation and strategy that it is required to follow in managing their portfolios. ZAIS\u2019s failure to comply with any of these guidelines and other limitations could result in losses to clients which, depending on the circumstances, could result in ZAIS\u2019s being obligated to make clients whole for such losses. If ZAIS believed that the circumstances did not justify a reimbursement, or clients believed the reimbursement it offered was insufficient, they could seek to recover damages from ZAIS, withdraw assets from ZAIS\u2019s funds or terminate their investment advisory agreement with ZAIS. Any of these events could harm ZAIS\u2019s reputation and adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s business.\nZAIS\u2019s expenses are subject to fluctuations that could materially impact ZAIS\u2019s results of operations.\nZAIS\u2019s results of operations depend on the level of ZAIS\u2019s expenses, which can vary from period to period. ZAIS and its affiliates have certain fixed expenses that they incur as going concerns, and some of those expenses are not subject to adjustment. If ZAIS\u2019s revenues decrease, without a corresponding decrease in expenses, ZAIS\u2019s results of operations would be negatively impacted. While ZAIS attempts to project expense levels in advance, there is no guarantee that an unforeseen expense will not arise or that ZAIS will be able to adjust its variable expenses quickly enough to match a declining asset base. Consequently, either event could have either a temporary or long-term negative impact on ZAIS\u2019s results of operations.\nZAIS may be subject to litigation risks and may face liabilities and damage to ZAIS\u2019s professional reputation as a result.\nIn recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against investment managers have been increasing. ZAIS makes investment decisions on behalf of investors in ZAIS\u2019s funds that could result in substantial losses. This may subject ZAIS to legal liabilities or actions alleging, among other things, negligence, intentional misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty or breach of contract. Further, ZAIS may be subject to third-party litigation arising from allegations that ZAIS improperly exercised control or influence over investments. In addition, ZAIS and its affiliates that are the investment managers and general partners of ZAIS, ZAIS\u2019s funds and those of ZAIS\u2019s employees who are ZAIS\u2019s, ZAIS\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 or the funds\u2019 officers and directors are each exposed to the risks of litigation specific to the funds\u2019 investment activities and, in the case where the funds that ZAIS or its affiliates manage are public companies, to the risk of shareholder litigation by the public companies\u2019 shareholders. Moreover, ZAIS is exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors or regulators alleging ZAIS\u2019s having engaged, or ZAIS\u2019s funds having engaged, in transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed.\nLegal liability or the commencement of legal actions against ZAIS could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s businesses, financial condition or results of operations or cause reputational harm to us, which could harm ZAIS\u2019s businesses. ZAIS depends to a large extent on ZAIS\u2019s business relationships and ZAIS\u2019s reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for ZAIS\u2019s funds. As a result, allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct by ZAIS, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, ZAIS\u2019s investment activities or the investment industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm ZAIS\u2019s reputation, which may be damaging to ZAIS\u2019s businesses.\nThe cost of insuring ZAIS\u2019s business is significant and may increase.\nZAIS\u2019s insurance costs are significant and can fluctuate substantially from year to year. In addition, certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs. As ZAIS renews insurance coverage, it may be subject to additional costs caused by premium increases, higher deductibles, co-insurance liability, changes in the size of ZAIS\u2019s business or nature of ZAIS\u2019s operations, litigation or acquisitions or dispositions. ZAIS may also obtain additional forms, and increased levels of, coverage resulting from being a part of a public company which may involve materially increased costs.\nIn addition, ZAIS may obtain additional liability insurance for ZAIS\u2019s directors and officers. There have been historical periods in which directors' and officers' liability insurance and errors and omissions insurance have been available only with limited coverage amounts, less favorable terms or at prohibitive cost, and these conditions could recur.\nRisks Related to ZAIS\u2019s Funds and Managed Accounts\nDependence on leverage by certain of ZAIS\u2019s funds subjects them to potential volatility and contractions in the debt financing markets and could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\nCertain of ZAIS\u2019s funds use leverage, and ZAIS\u2019s ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments in those funds will depend on ZAIS\u2019s ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. ZAIS\u2019s funds may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs. As of September 30, 2014, ZAIS served as investment manager to four funds utilizing various degrees of leverage. These funds had combined AUM of $1.3 billion. The weighted average leverage ratio of these funds is approximately 79.97% (based on net asset value), with one fund accounting for a majority of the leverage employed. The use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss to investors. A fund may borrow money from time to time to make investments or may enter into derivative transactions that have embedded leverage. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing or embedded leverage may not be recovered by returns on such investments and may be lost, and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated, in the event of a decline in the market value of such investments. Gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund\u2019s net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. However, if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund\u2019s net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings. An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investments that ZAIS\u2019s funds make. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf ZAIS\u2019s funds or the issuers or companies in which ZAIS\u2019s funds invest raise capital in the structured credit, leveraged loan or high yield bond markets, the results of their operations may suffer if such markets experience dislocations, contractions or volatility. Any such events could adversely impact the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to an overall weakening of the U.S. and global economies. Any economic downturn could adversely affect the financial resources of ZAIS\u2019s funds and their investments (in particular those investments that depend on credit from third parties or that otherwise participate in the credit markets) and their ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, outstanding debt when due. Moreover, these events could affect the terms of available debt financing with, for example, higher rates, higher equity requirements or more restrictive covenants.\nThe absence of available sources of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time or an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those investments. Certain investments may also be financed through borrowings on fund-level debt facilities, which may or may not be available for a refinancing at the end of their respective terms. In addition, the interest payments on the indebtedness used to finance ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 investments are generally deductible expenses for applicable income tax purposes, but may be subject to limitations with respect to timing or amount under applicable tax law and policy. Any change in such tax law or policy to eliminate or substantially limit the availability of these income tax deductions may reduce the after-tax rates of return on the affected investments for certain investors, which may have an adverse impact on ZAIS\u2019s businesses and financial results.\nIf the markets make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, some of ZAIS\u2019s investee companies may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of ZAIS\u2019s funds may invest in companies that are highly leveraged, which may increase the risk of loss associated with those investments.\nSome of ZAIS\u2019s funds may invest in companies whose capital structures involve significant leverage. For example, in many non-distressed leveraged loan investments, indebtedness may be as much as 75% or more of an investee company\u2019s total debt and equity capitalization, including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment, whether incurred at or above the investment-level entity. In distressed situations, indebtedness may exceed 100% or more of an investee company\u2019s capitalization. Additionally, while ZAIS\u2019s funds generally purchase senior positions in the aforementioned companies, the debt positions acquired by ZAIS\u2019s funds may be the most junior in what could be a complex capital structure, and thus subject ZAIS to the greatest risk of loss.\nInvestments in highly leveraged entities are also inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments.\nFurthermore, incurring a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:\n\u00b7 subject the entity to a number of restrictive covenants, terms and conditions, any violation of which could be viewed by creditors as an event of default and could materially impact ZAIS\u2019s fund\u2019s ability to realize value from the investment;\n\u00b7 allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render the entity unable to service its indebtedness, leading to a bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of part or all of ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 investment in it;\n\u00b7 give rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow, which might limit the entity\u2019s ability to respond to changing industry conditions if additional cash is needed for the response, to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities;\n\u00b7 limit the entity\u2019s ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have relatively less debt;\n\u00b7 limit the entity\u2019s ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth; and\n\u00b7 limit the entity\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for capital expenditures, working capital or other general corporate purposes.\nA substantial portion of ZAIS\u2019s investments may be recorded at fair value as determined in good faith and, as a result, there may be uncertainty regarding the value of ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 investments.\nThe debt and equity instruments in which ZAIS\u2019s funds invest for which market quotations are not readily available will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by ZAIS. Most, if not all, of ZAIS\u2019s fund\u2019s investments (other than cash and cash equivalents) are classified as Level 3 under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. This means that the valuation of assets of ZAIS\u2019s funds will be based on unobservable inputs and assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability in question. ZAIS expects that inputs into the determination of fair value of ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 investments will require significant management judgment or estimation. Even if observable market data are available, such information may be the result of consensus pricing information or broker quotes, which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing or quotes accompanied by disclaimers materially reduces the reliability of such information.\nThe types of factors that ZAIS may take into account in determining the fair value of a fund\u2019s investments generally include broker quotes (if available), market rates of interest, general economic conditions, economic conditions in particular industries, the condition of financial markets, the financial condition of issuers, recent trading activity, and other relevant factors. Because such valuations are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, ZAIS\u2019s determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these debt and equity instruments existed.\nBecause there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in a fund\u2019s net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained by ZAIS on behalf of the fund when such investments are sold. ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 net asset value could be adversely affected if determinations regarding the fair value of such fund\u2019s investments were materially higher than the values that such fund ultimately realizes upon the disposal of such loans and securities. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in fund net asset values would result in losses for the applicable fund, a decline in asset management fees and the loss of potential incentive income. Also, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in fund net asset values will cause investors to lose confidence in ZAIS which could, in turn, result in redemptions from ZAIS\u2019s funds or difficulties in raising additional funds.\nZAIS\u2019s funds may face risks relating to undiversified investments.\nWhile diversification within the asset class in which a ZAIS fund invests is generally an objective of ZAIS\u2019s funds, there can be no assurance as to the degree of diversification, if any, that will be achieved in any fund. Difficult market conditions or slowdowns affecting a particular asset class, geographic region or other category of investment could have a significant adverse impact on a fund if its investments are concentrated in that area, which would result in lower investment returns. This lack of diversification may expose a fund to losses disproportionate to economic conditions or market declines in general if there are disproportionately greater adverse movements in the particular investments. If a fund holds investments concentrated in a particular issuer, security, asset class or geographic region, such fund may be more susceptible than a more widely diversified investment portfolio to the negative consequences of a single corporate, economic, political or regulatory event. Accordingly, a lack of diversification on the part of a fund could adversely affect a fund\u2019s performance and, as a result, ZAIS\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of ZAIS\u2019s funds invest in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets that often have significantly leveraged capital structures, and ZAIS may fail to realize any profits from these investments for a considerable period of time, lose some or all of the principal amount it invests in these investments or may not be able to liquidate these investments at a desired price.\nZAIS\u2019s funds may make investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and which may be illiquid. Timely divestiture or sale of trading positions can be impaired by decreased trading volume, increased price volatility, concentrated trading positions, limitations on the ability to transfer positions in highly specialized or structured transactions to which ZAIS may be a party, limits imposed by exchanges or other regulatory organizations, market disruptions and changes in industry and government regulations. When a fund holds a security or position, it is vulnerable to price and value fluctuations and may experience losses if the value of the position decreases and the fund is unable to timely sell, hedge or transfer the position.\nIn particular, with respect to futures contracts, it may be difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. Limits imposed by futures exchanges or other regulatory organizations, such as accountability levels, position limits and price fluctuation limits, may contribute to a lack of liquidity with respect to certain investments. In addition, over-the-counter contracts and cleared swaps may be illiquid because they are contracts between two parties and generally may not be transferred by one party to a third party without the counterparty\u2019s consent. Conversely, a counterparty may give its consent, but a fund still may not be able to transfer an over-the-counter contract to a third party due to concerns regarding the counterparty\u2019s credit risk. In addition, ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 assets are subject to the risk of failure of any of the exchanges or other trading platforms on which their positions trade or of central clearinghouses or counterparties. Most U.S. exchanges limit fluctuations in certain prices during a single day by imposing \u201cdaily price fluctuation limits\u201d or \u201cdaily limits,\u201d the existence of which may reduce liquidity or effectively curtail trading in particular markets.\nTherefore, it may be impossible or costly for ZAIS\u2019s funds to liquidate positions rapidly, particularly if the relevant market is moving against a position or in the event of trading halts or daily price movement limits on the market or otherwise. Alternatively, it may not be possible in certain circumstances for a position to be purchased or sold promptly, particularly if there is insufficient trading activity in the relevant market or otherwise.\nInvestments by ZAIS\u2019s investment funds may rank junior to investments made by others.\nThe securities in which ZAIS\u2019s funds invest may be subordinate to other of the issuer\u2019s securities that rank senior to them. By their terms, these senior securities may provide that their holders are entitled to receive payments of interest or principal on or before the dates on which payments are to be made to the securities held by ZAIS\u2019s funds. Also, in the event of a default or other credit event including, but not limited to, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy, holders of securities ranking senior to ZAIS\u2019s investment may typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made for ZAIS\u2019s investment. After repaying senior security holders, the issuer of the securities held by ZAIS\u2019s funds may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying amounts owed to the securities held by ZAIS\u2019s funds. To the extent that any assets remain, holders of securities that rank equally with those securities held by ZAIS\u2019s funds would be entitled to share on an equal and ratable basis in distributions that are made out of those assets. Also, during periods of financial distress or following an insolvency, the ability of ZAIS\u2019s funds to influence an issuer\u2019s affairs and to take actions to protect their investments may be substantially less than that of the senior security holders.\nThird-party investors in ZAIS\u2019s private funds may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested, which could adversely affect a fund\u2019s operations and performance.\nHistorically, certain of ZAIS\u2019s private equity style funds have required investors to make capital commitments that ZAIS is entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. ZAIS has historically depended on investors fulfilling and honoring their commitments when it calls capital from them in connection with making investments and otherwise paying their obligations when due. Any investor that did not fund a capital call would be subject to several possible penalties, including having a meaningful amount of its existing investment forfeited in that fund. However, the impact of the penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an investor has invested little or no capital, for instance early in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful. Investors may also negotiate for lesser or reduced penalties at the outset of the fund, thereby limiting ZAIS\u2019s ability to enforce the funding of a capital call. Third-party investors in private funds often use distributions from prior investments to meet future capital calls. In cases where valuations of existing investments fall and the pace of distributions slows, investors may be unable to make new commitments to third-party managed investment funds such as those advised by us. The failure of investors to honor a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds could have a material adverse effect on the operation and performance of those funds and, in turn, ZAIS\u2019s business.\nZAIS\u2019s funds may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time.\nZAIS\u2019s funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved or that it may be forced to dispose of at an inopportune time to meet an investor redemption request. Although ZAIS generally expects that investments will be disposed of prior to dissolution or be suitable for in-kind distribution at dissolution of a fund, ZAIS\u2019s funds may have to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time as a result of dissolution of a fund. This would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself.\nHedging strategies may adversely affect the returns on ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 investments.\nWhen managing its exposure to market risks, ZAIS may (on its own behalf or on behalf of ZAIS\u2019s funds) from time to time use forward contracts, options, swaps (including total return swaps), caps, collars, floors, foreign currency forward contracts, currency swap agreements, currency option contracts or other instruments. The success of any hedging or other derivative transactions generally will depend on the degree of correlation between price movements of a derivative instrument and the position being hedged, the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the costs of the hedging transaction and other factors. Because ZAIS may enter into a transaction to hedge its or a fund\u2019s exposure to market risks, while the transaction may reduce the risks of losses with respect to adverse movements in such market factors, the transaction may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged positions increases. There can be no assurance that any hedging transaction will successfully hedge the risks associated with hedged positions or that it will not result in poorer overall investment performance than if it had not been executed.\nWhile such hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail certain other risks. These arrangements may require the posting of cash or other collateral at a time when ZAIS or a fund has insufficient cash or illiquid assets such that the posting of the cash is either impossible or requires the sale of assets at prices that do not reflect their underlying value. Moreover, these hedging arrangements may generate significant transaction costs, including potential tax costs, that may reduce the anticipated returns on an investment. Finally, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) has indicated that it may soon issue a proposal for certain foreign exchange products to be subject to mandatory clearing, which could increase the costs of entering into currency hedges.\nZAIS\u2019s failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest could damage ZAIS\u2019s reputation and adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s businesses.\nAs ZAIS expands the number and scope of ZAIS\u2019s businesses, it will increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to its investment activities on behalf of itself and its funds. ZAIS serves as the investment adviser to a number of existing funds, and may, in the future, establish new funds that will compete with one another and with ZAIS. Certain of ZAIS\u2019s funds may have overlapping investment objectives and strategies, including funds that have different fee structures, and potential conflicts may arise with respect to ZAIS\u2019s decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those funds and between itself and its funds. For example, a decision to receive material non-public information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund gives rise to a potential conflict of interest when it results in ZAIS\u2019s having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action with respect to such company.\nThere are also additional conflicts of interest that ZAIS encounters in managing its funds. ZAIS may or may not cause its funds to purchase different classes of securities that may have interests that conflict with the interests owned by it or a fund that it manages. ZAIS or the funds that it manages may hold similar positions or the same security, yet ZAIS or a fund it manages may liquidate its position as circumstances warrant, potentially affecting the liquidity or value of the securities held by another fund ZAIS manages. ZAIS or funds managed by ZAIS may take conflicting positions with that of another ZAIS managed fund. For example, ZAIS or one of ZAIS\u2019s funds may take a long position while another fund may take a short position in the same security. Additional conflicts may arise in circumstances where a fund that ZAIS manages purchases or sells assets to another fund that ZAIS manages. Further, ZAIS may liquidate investments at different times than the funds it manages due to, among other things, differences in investment strategies or fund durations.\nIn addition to the various conflicts set forth above, conflicts of interest may exist in the valuation of ZAIS\u2019s investments and regarding decisions about the allocation of specific investment opportunities among ZAIS and ZAIS\u2019s funds and the allocation of fees and costs among ZAIS and ZAIS\u2019s funds. Though ZAIS believes it has appropriate means to resolve these conflicts, ZAIS\u2019s judgment on any particular issue could be challenged. If ZAIS fails to appropriately address any such conflicts, it could negatively impact ZAIS\u2019s reputation and ability to raise additional funds or maintain existing clients or result in potential litigation against us.\nCertain of ZAIS\u2019s funds invest in residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d) and residential mortgage loans that are subject to particular risks.\nCertain of ZAIS\u2019s funds invest in RMBS and residential mortgage loans. These loans may be either retained or securitized, the securities of which may be sold to third party investors.\nAs of September 30, 2014, ZAIS served as investment manager to 8 funds investing in RMBS or residential mortgage loans. These funds have combined AUM of approximately $1.44 billion.\nHolders of RMBS or residential mortgage loans that underlie RMBS generally bear risks inherent in investment in structured credit and leveraged loans. In particular, the rate of defaults and losses will be affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, the unemployment rate, the level of interest rates, the availability of mortgage credit, local conditions in the geographic area where the related mortgaged property is located, the terms of the loan, the borrower\u2019s equity in the mortgaged property and the financial circumstances of the borrower. Further, a region\u2019s economic condition and housing market may be directly, or indirectly, adversely affected by natural disasters or civil disturbances such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, eruptions or riots. The above factors may have a larger effect depending on the composition of the residential mortgage loans that underlie an RMBS. For example, an RMBS may invest in subprime, non-conforming mortgage loans, balloon mortgage loans, interest only mortgage loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, and negatively amortizing mortgage loans, all of which may be subject to greater risks than traditional fixed rate mortgage loans. The residential mortgage loans underlying an RMBS may not be diversified in terms of geography, interest rates or terms.\nForeclosure. Residential mortgage foreclosure rates increased significantly in connection with the crisis in the credit markets that began in 2007 - 2008. This trend negatively impacted the financial and capital markets generally and the mortgage-lending and mortgage-investment industry segments more specifically. If a residential mortgage loan is in default, foreclosure of such residential mortgage loan may be a lengthy and difficult process, and may involve significant expenses. Furthermore, the market for defaulted residential mortgage loans or foreclosed properties may be very limited. In the event that ZAIS invests in residential mortgage loans that are subsequently foreclosed on, ZAIS would likely lose some or all of its investment, which could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s performance and profitability.\nUnderwriting. Defaults may result from substandard underwriting and purchasing guidelines or the failure of the loan originator to comply with good or adequate origination guidelines. The applicable originator\u2019s underwriting standards and any applicable purchasing guidelines may not identify or appropriately assess the risk that the interest and principal payments due on a mortgage loan will be repaid when due, or at all, or whether the market value of the related mortgaged property will be sufficient to otherwise provide for recovery of such amounts. In addition, with respect to any exceptions made to the applicable originator\u2019s underwriting standards in originating a mortgage loan, those exceptions may be subjective and may increase the risk that principal and interest amounts may not be received or recovered and compensating factors, if any, which may be the premise for making an exception to the underwriting standards may not, in fact, compensate for any additional risk. No assurance can be given that any of the mortgage loans that ZAIS acquires from an originator will comply with such originator\u2019s underwriting guidelines or that any mortgage loans will have compensating factors in the event that those mortgage loans do not comply with the related originator\u2019s underwriting guidelines. Mortgage loans owned by ZAIS\u2019s funds either directly or through RMBS may have been originated with less stringent underwriting guidelines than mortgage loans being originated in the current environment.\nPrepayment. The rate of prepayments of newly originated residential mortgage loans will be sensitive to prevailing interest rates. Generally, if prevailing interest rates decline, mortgage prepayments may increase if refinancing is available at lower interest rates. If prevailing interest rates rise, prepayments on the mortgage loans may decrease. However, an expansion of credit could result in an increase in refinancing activity even in a rising interest rate environment if credit standards are relaxed and underwriting guidelines expanded. Prepayments also may occur as a result of solicitations of the borrowers by mortgage loan lenders. In addition, the timing of prepayments of principal may also be affected by liquidations of or insurance payments on the mortgage loan, or repurchases by the related originator for breaches of representations and warranties or defective documentation. An increase in prepayments has a negative effect on the value of mortgage loans due to the loss of future interest payments.\nLiability of Ownership. Ownership of residential mortgage loans also includes the potential of certain legal risks of ownership, including assignee liabilities. The Truth in Lending Act provides that subsequent purchasers of residential mortgage loans originated in violation of certain requirements specified in the Truth in Lending Act may have liability for such violations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) also prohibits lenders from originating residential mortgage loans unless the lender determines that the borrower has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. This requirement has been codified in the \u201cability-to-repay\u201d rules (collectively, the \u201cATR Rules\u201d) under the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cRegulation Z\u201d). The ATR Rules, among other things, require that originators follow certain procedures and obtain certain documents in order to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan. In addition, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued regulations, which became effective January 2014, specifying the standards for a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d that would have the benefit of a safe harbor from liability under the ATR Rules if certain requirements are satisfied, or a rebuttable presumption from such liability if only certain of these requirements are satisfied. Interest-only loans, hybrid mortgage loans and balloon loans, as well as loans with a debt-to-income ratio exceeding 43% in general do not constitute qualified mortgages. Possible liabilities that could be required to be paid by an assignee of a mortgage loan include actual damages suffered by the borrower, litigation costs (which could exceed the principal amount of a mortgage loan), statutory damages and special statutory damages. A borrower may also assert a violation of the ATR Rules as a defense in a foreclosure action. Various state and local legislatures may adopt similar or more onerous provisions in the future. ZAIS is unable to predict how these laws and regulations relating to assignee liability may affect the ability of the fund to successfully complete exit strategies that utilize securitization. In addition, the qualified mortgage rule may adversely affect the market generally for mortgage-backed securities, if investors are not willing to invest in pools of mortgage loans that do not satisfy the qualified mortgage requirement.\nThird Party Service Providers. Mortgage loans are subject to risks of loss related to the third party service providers, including from violations of consumer protection laws, servicing protocols and servicing errors, including errors in the recordation of mortgage loans, or other factors that may cause foreclosure delays. Loan modifications by servicers may impact the value of mortgage loans.\nCertain of ZAIS\u2019s funds invest in commercial related mortgage assets that are subject to particular risks.\nZAIS\u2019s funds invest in a variety of assets backed by commercial mortgages including commercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d), commercial real estate mortgages and mezzanine loans and direct commercial property ownership. As of September 30, 2014, ZAIS served as an investment manager to eight funds investing in CMBS, commercial real estate mortgages and mezzanine loans and direct commercial property ownership. The fair market value of the CMBS, commercial real estate mortgages and mezzanine loans and direct commercial property ownership held by these funds was approximately $48 million as of September 30, 2014.\nThe value of the commercial mortgage loans and the assets backed by commercial mortgages will be influenced by the rate of delinquencies and defaults experienced on the commercial mortgage loans and by the severity of loss incurred as result of such defaults. The factors influencing delinquencies, defaults and loss severity include: (i) economic and real estate market conditions by industry sectors (e.g., multifamily, retail, office, etc.); (ii) the terms and structure of the mortgage loans; and (iii) any specific limits to legal and financial recourse upon a default under the terms of the mortgage loan.\nExercise of foreclosure and other remedies may involve lengthy delays and additional legal and other related expenses on top of potentially declining property values. In certain circumstances, the creditors may also become liable upon taking title to an asset for environmental or structural damage existing at the property.\nCommercial mortgage loans are generally viewed as having a greater risk of loss through delinquency and foreclosure than investing in the securities of single family residences. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation and operating income of such property (i.e., the ability of tenants to make lease payments, the ability of a property to attract and retain tenants, and the ability of the owner to maintain the property, minimize operating expenses and comply with applicable zoning and other laws) rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. Many commercial mortgage loans provide recourse only to specific assets, such as the property, and not against the borrower's other assets or personal guarantees.\nCommercial mortgage loans generally do not fully amortize, which can necessitate a sale of the property or refinancing of the remaining \u201cballoon\u201d amount at or prior to maturity of the mortgage loan. Accordingly, investors in commercial mortgage loans and CMBS bear the risk that the borrower will be unable to refinance or otherwise repay the mortgage at maturity, thereby increasing the likelihood of a default on the borrower's obligation.\nThe repayment of a commercial mortgage loan is typically dependent upon the ability of the related mortgaged property to produce cash flow through the collection of rents. Even the liquidation value of a commercial property is determined, in substantial part, by the amount of the mortgaged property\u2019s cash flow (or its potential to generate cash flow). However, net operating income and cash flow are often based on assumptions regarding tenant behavior and market conditions. Net operating income and cash flow can be volatile over time and may be insufficient to cover debt service on the mortgage loan at any given time. Lenders typically look to the debt service coverage ratio (that is, the ratio of net cash flow to debt service) of a mortgage loan secured by income-producing property as an important measure of the risk of default of that mortgage loan.\nThe net operating income, cash flow and property value of a commercial mortgage property may be adversely affected by a large number of factors specific to the property, such as:\n\u00b7 the age, design and construction quality of the mortgage property;\n\u00b7 perceptions regarding the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the mortgaged property;\n\u00b7 the characteristics of the neighborhood where the mortgaged property is located;\n\u00b7 the proximity and attractiveness of competing properties;\n\u00b7 the adequacy of the mortgaged property\u2019s management and maintenance;\n\u00b7 increases in interest rates, real estate taxes and other operating expenses at the mortgaged property and in relation to competing properties;\n\u00b7 an increase in the capital expenditures needed to maintain the mortgaged property or make improvements;\n\u00b7 the dependence upon a single tenant, or a concentration of tenants, at the mortgaged property in a particular business or industry;\n\u00b7 a decline in the financial condition of a major tenant at the mortgaged property;\n\u00b7 an increase in vacancy rates for the applicable property type in the relevant geographic area;\n\u00b7 a decline in rental rates as leases are renewed or entered into with new tenants;\n\u00b7 national, regional or local economic conditions (including plant closings, military base closings, industry slowdowns and unemployment rates);\n\u00b7 local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of competing properties, space, multifamily housing, manufactured housing or hotel capacity);\n\u00b7 natural disasters or civil disturbances such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, eruptions or riots;\n\u00b7 the length of tenant leases (including that in certain cases, all or substantially all of the tenants, or one or more sole, anchor or other tenants, at a particular mortgaged property have leases that expire or permit the tenant(s) to terminate its or their lease(s) during the term of the related mortgage loan) and other lease terms, including co-tenancy provisions;\n\u00b7 the creditworthiness of tenants;\n\u00b7 tenant defaults;\n\u00b7 in the case of rental properties, the rate at which vacant space or space under expiring leases is re-let; and\n\u00b7 the mortgaged property\u2019s \u201coperating leverage\u201d (i.e., the percentage of total property expenses in relation to revenue, the ratio of fixed operating expenses to those that vary with revenues, and the level of capital expenditures required to maintain the property and to retain or replace tenants).\nA decline in the real estate market or in the financial condition of a major tenant will tend to have a more immediate effect on the net operating income of mortgaged properties with short-term revenue sources, such as short-term or month-to-month leases or leases with termination options, and may lead to higher rates of delinquency or defaults under the related mortgage loans.\nIn addition, underwritten or adjusted cash flows, by their nature, are speculative and are based upon certain assumptions and projections, including with respect to matters such as tenancy and rental income. The failure of these assumptions or projections in whole or in part could cause the underwritten or adjusted cash flows to vary substantially from the actual cash flows of a mortgaged property.\nCertain of ZAIS\u2019s funds invest in certain other structured finance securities that are subject to particular risks.\nZAIS\u2019s funds invest in structured finance securities, including CDOs, collateralized loan obligations (\u201cCLOs\u201d), stripped mortgage backed securities, synthetic risk transfer securities, home equity loan backed securities, securities backed by manufactured housing loans and other asset backed securities that are subject to particular risks, including:\n\u00b7 Insolvency considerations with respect to issuers of securitized products;\n\u00b7 Control rights and the intentions of the parties holding such control rights;\n\u00b7 Uninvested cash balances may limit returns, thereby possibly limiting amounts available for distribution to the security holders;\n\u00b7 The performance of structured finance securities are heavily dependent on the decisions of the manager of the securities;\n\u00b7 Action by a rating agency may affect the performance of a structured finance security;\n\u00b7 Optional or mandatory redemptions by holders of senior or mezzanine tranches of securities may affect the performance and life of the securities;\n\u00b7 Limited information is available with respect to the collateral of these structured finance securities;\n\u00b7 Certain structured finance securities may contain covenant lite loans which carry additional risks;\n\u00b7 The restructuring of the government sponsored entities could impact the performance of securities guaranteed by such agencies; and\n\u00b7 Structured finance securities often contain conflicts of interests between a manager and the owners of certain classes of the issuer\u2019s securities.\nCertain of ZAIS\u2019s funds invest in leveraged loans that are subject to particular risks.\nZAIS\u2019s funds invest in leveraged loans, either directly, or through securities backed by leveraged loans, including CLOs. In addition, ZAIS may invest in a fund that invests in the equity tranches of CLO transactions for which ZAIS serves as the investment manager, which would provide exposure to leveraged loans. Further, the recently adopted European and U.S. risk retention requirements will require ZAIS to invest in a percentage of the debt or equity in the CLOs (and therefore leveraged loans) it manages. Leveraged loans may be risky and investors in these types of investments could lose some or all of their investments.\nLeveraged loans may experience volatility in the spread that is paid on such leveraged loans. Such spreads will vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of supply and demand in the leveraged loan market, general economic conditions, levels of relative liquidity for leveraged loans, the actual and perceived level of credit risk in the leveraged loan market, regulatory changes, changes in credit ratings and the methodology used by credit rating agencies in assigning credit ratings, and such other factors that may affect pricing in the leveraged loan market. Since leveraged loans may generally be prepaid at any time without penalty, the obligors of such leveraged loans would be expected to prepay or refinance such leveraged loans if alternative financing were available at a lower cost. For example, if the credit ratings of an obligor were upgraded, the obligor were recapitalized or if credit spreads were declining for leveraged loans, such obligor would likely seek to refinance at a lower credit spread. The rates at which leveraged loans may prepay or refinance and the level of credit spreads for leveraged loans in the future are subject to numerous factors and are difficult to predict. Declining credit spreads in the leveraged loan market and increasing rates of prepayments and refinancings will likely result in a reduction of portfolio yield and interest collections on leveraged loans owned by ZAIS.\nLeveraged loans have historically experienced greater default rates than has been the case for investment grade securities and loans. A non-investment grade loan or debt obligation or an interest in a non-investment grade loan is generally considered speculative in nature and may become a defaulted asset for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u00b7 Some of the borrowers underlying these leveraged loans have relatively short or no operating histories. These companies are and will be subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise, including the risk that these companies may not reach their investment objective and the value of ZAIS\u2019s fund\u2019s investment in them may decline substantially.\n\u00b7 The borrower companies may be unable to meet their obligations under the securities held by ZAIS\u2019s funds, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of their securities or of any collateral with respect to any securities and a reduction in the likelihood of ZAIS\u2019s funds realizing on any guarantees they may have obtained in connection with their investment.\n\u00b7 Because many of the obligors on leveraged loans are privately held companies, public information is generally not available about these companies. ZAIS\u2019s funds will depend partially on obtaining adequate information to evaluate these companies in making investment decisions from biased parties including the lead underwriter(s) and the borrower, themselves.\n\u00b7 Many of these borrowers have substantial financial leverage which will make it difficult for them to access the capital markets to meet future capital needs. The high leverage also makes operating results less predictable and may affect their competitiveness.\n\u00b7 Most of ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 leveraged borrowers borrow money at floating spreads tied to LIBOR. When LIBOR rises, their total interest costs increase and their interest coverage ratios drop which can cause a payment default.\n\u00b7 A portfolio company's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by ZAIS\u2019s funds or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize a portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations under the debt securities that ZAIS\u2019s funds hold. ZAIS\u2019s funds may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms, which may include the waiver of certain financial covenants, with a defaulting portfolio company.\nUpon any loan becoming a defaulted asset, such defaulted asset may become subject to either substantial workout negotiations or restructuring, which may entail, among other things, a substantial reduction in the interest rate, a substantial write-down of principal, and a substantial change in the terms, conditions and covenants with respect to such defaulted asset. In addition, such negotiations or restructuring may be quite extensive and protracted over time, and therefore may result in substantial uncertainty with respect to the ultimate recovery on such defaulted asset. The liquidity for defaulted assets may be limited, and to the extent that defaulted assets are sold, it is highly unlikely that the proceeds from such sale will be equal to the amount of unpaid principal and interest thereon.\nLoans and interests in loans have significant liquidity and market value risks since they are not generally traded in organized exchange markets but are traded by banks and other institutional investors engaged in loan syndications. Because loans are privately syndicated and loan agreements are privately negotiated and customized, loans are not purchased or sold as easily as publicly traded securities. A portion of these investments may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale, transfer, pledge or other disposition or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. In addition, historically the trading volume in the loan market has been small relative to the high-yield debt securities market. Depending upon market conditions, there may be a very limited market for leveraged loans. Non-investment grade loans are often issued in connection with leveraged acquisitions in which the issuers incur a substantially higher amount of indebtedness than the level at which they had previously operated. The lower rating of non-investment grade loans reflects a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of the obligor or general economic conditions (including, for example, a substantial period of rising interest rates or declining earnings or disruptions in the financial markets) or both may impair the ability of the obligor to make payments of principal and interest.\nZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 investment in credit default swaps and other synthetic securities carry certain risks.\nZAIS\u2019s funds invest in credit default swaps (\u201cCDS\u201d) and other synthetic securities that carry certain risks. ZAIS\u2019s funds may enter into CDS either as a \u201cbuyer\u201d or a \u201cseller.\u201d The \u201cbuyer\u201d in a credit default contract is obligated to pay the \u201cseller\u201d a periodic stream of payments over the term of the contract in return for a contingent payment upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to an underlying reference obligation. If a credit event occurs, the seller typically is obligated to pay the contingent payment to the buyer, which is typically the full notional value of the reference obligation. The contingent payment may be payment of the face amount of the obligation in return for physical delivery of the reference obligation or cash settlement of the difference between the face amount of the obligation and its market value. Thus, if a credit event occurs and one of ZAIS\u2019s funds is a buyer of a CDS, such fund would expect to receive the full notional value of the underlying reference obligation. If a fund is a buyer of a CDS, and if no credit event occurs, that fund will have made fixed payments and received nothing, and thus may incur losses. If one of ZAIS\u2019s funds is a seller of a CDS and a credit event occurs, that fund may incur significant losses.\nIn addition to general market risks, CDSs may be subject to liquidity risk and credit risk of the applicable counterparty. While certain index CDS are now subject to mandatory clearing and execution on a swap execution facility, certain other CDS (including single-name CDS) continue to be entered into a bilateral privately-negotiated basis. The buyer of such bilateral CDS may also incur a loss if the seller fails to perform on its obligation should a credit event occur. In certain circumstances, the buyer can receive the notional value of a CDS only by delivering a physical security to the seller, and is at risk if deliverable securities are unavailable or illiquid. Credit risk may also arise through a default by one of several large financial institutions that are dependent on one another to meet their liquidity or operational needs, so that a default by one institution causes a series of defaults by the other institutions. This \u201csystemic risk\u201d may adversely affect the financial intermediaries (such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges) with which the funds transact on a daily basis.\nZAIS\u2019s funds may also invest in synthetic securities, the reference obligations of which are one or more financial assets (including CDS). Investments in such types of assets through the purchase of synthetic securities present risks in addition to those resulting from direct purchases of such reference obligations. Under a synthetic security, the owner of the synthetic security will usually have a contractual relationship only with the counterparty of such synthetic security, and not the reference obligor on the reference obligation. The owner generally will have no right directly to enforce compliance by the reference obligor with the terms of the reference obligation or any rights of set-off against the reference obligor, nor will the owner generally have any voting or other consensual rights of ownership with respect to the reference obligation. ZAIS\u2019s funds that own such synthetic securities will not directly benefit from any collateral supporting the reference obligation and will not have the benefit of the remedies that would normally be available to a holder of a reference obligation. In addition, in the event of the insolvency of the issuer of such a synthetic security, the holder of such security may be treated as a general creditor of such issuer, and generally will not have any claim of title with respect to the reference obligation. Consequently, ZAIS\u2019s funds that own these synthetic securities would be subject to the credit risk of such counterparty as well as that of the reference obligor. As a result, concentrations of synthetic securities acquired from any one issuer will subject ZAIS\u2019s funds to an additional degree of risk with respect to defaults by such issuer as well as by the reference obligor.\nThrough their investment in synthetic securities, ZAIS\u2019s funds will be exposed to the risks related to the reference obligations of such synthetic securities. The market value of a reference obligation will generally fluctuate with, among other things, changes in prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions, the condition of certain financial markets, international political events, developments or trends in any particular industry, the financial condition of the reference obligor (and the obligors of the securitized assets underlying a reference obligation that is collateral security) and the terms of the reference obligation. Adverse changes in the financial condition of reference obligors (and the obligors of the securitized assets underlying an asset backed security), in general economic conditions or in both may result in a decline in the market value of a reference obligation. In addition, future periods of uncertainty in the United States economy and the economies of other countries in which reference obligors (and the obligors of the securitized assets underlying an asset backed security) are domiciled and the possibility of increased volatility and default rates may also adversely affect the price and liquidity of reference obligations.\nMany reference obligations will have no, or only a limited, trading market. Trading in fixed income securities in general, including asset-backed securities (\u201cABS\u201d) and related derivatives, often takes place primarily in over-the-counter markets consisting of groups of dealer firms that are typically major securities firms. Because the market for certain ABS and related derivatives is a dealer market, rather than an auction market, no single obtainable price for a given instrument prevails at any given time. Not all dealers maintain markets in these securities at all times. The illiquidity of reference obligations will restrict ZAIS\u2019s ability to take advantage of market opportunities. Illiquid reference obligations may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments. In addition, reference obligations may include privately placed securities that may or may not be freely transferable under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction or due to contractual restrictions on resale, and even if such privately placed securities are transferable, the value of such reference obligations could be less than what may be considered the fair value of such securities.\nZAIS\u2019s funds are subject to risks to the extent that they are newly established funds without a significant track record, have few limitations on their investment strategies, engage in short-selling and are not able to achieve the market position necessary to implement the strategy.\nZAIS\u2019s funds also are subject to the following additional risks which could negatively impact each fund and ZAIS\u2019s business:\n\u00b7 Certain of ZAIS\u2019s funds are newly established funds without a significant track record which may limit the ability of the fund to attract new investors.\n\u00b7 Certain of ZAIS\u2019s funds have few limitations on the execution of their investment strategies, which are subject to ZAIS\u2019s sole discretion.\n\u00b7 Certain of ZAIS\u2019s funds may engage in short-selling of securities as an investment strategy, which is subject to unlimited risk of loss because there is theoretically no limit on how much the price of a security may appreciate before the short position is closed out. A fund that borrows securities to effect short sales as a hedging strategy may be subject to losses if the security lender demands return of the loaned securities and the fund is unable to borrow securities that are necessary to maintain the short position used to hedge its position.\n\u00b7 The efficacy of certain investment and trading strategies depends largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of financial instruments. A fund's trading orders may not be executed in a timely and efficient manner due to various circumstances, including systems failures or human error. In such event, the funds might only be able to acquire some but not all of the components of the position, or if the overall position were to need adjustment, the funds might not be able to make such adjustment. As a result, the funds would not be able to achieve the market position selected by the management company or general partner of such funds, and might incur a loss in liquidating their position.\nZAIS depends on its senior management team, senior investment professionals and other key personnel, and its ability to retain them and attract additional qualified personnel is critical to its success and growth prospects.\n\u00b7 ZAIS depends on the diligence, skill, judgment, business contacts and personal reputations of ZAIS\u2019s senior management team, including Christian Zugel, ZAIS\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, and Michael Szymanski, ZAIS\u2019s President, senior investment professionals and other key personnel. ZAIS\u2019s future success will depend upon its ability to retain its senior professionals and other key personnel and its ability to recruit additional qualified personnel. These individuals possess substantial experience and expertise in investing, are responsible for locating and executing ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 investments, have significant relationships with the institutions that are the sources of many of ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 investment opportunities and, in certain cases, have strong relationships with ZAIS\u2019s investors. Therefore, if any of ZAIS\u2019s senior professionals or other key personnel join competitors or form competing companies, it could result in the loss of significant investment opportunities and certain existing investors.\n\u00b7 The departure for any reason of any of ZAIS\u2019s senior professionals could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s ability to achieve ZAIS\u2019s investment objectives, cause certain of ZAIS\u2019s investors to withdraw capital they invest with ZAIS or elect not to commit additional capital to ZAIS\u2019s funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s business and ZAIS\u2019s prospects. The departure of some or all of those individuals, including ZAIS\u2019 Chief Investment Officer, Christian Zugel, could also trigger certain \u201ckey man\u201d provisions in the documentation governing certain of ZAIS\u2019s funds, which would permit the investors in certain funds to withdraw their capital. ZAIS carries limited \u201ckey man\u201d insurance on certain individuals that would provide ZAIS with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of certain of ZAIS\u2019s senior professionals, and ZAIS does not have a policy that prohibits ZAIS\u2019s senior professionals from traveling together.\n\u00b7 ZAIS anticipates that it will be necessary for it to add investment professionals both to grow ZAIS\u2019s businesses and to replace those who depart. However, the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive and ZAIS may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or it may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. ZAIS\u2019s efforts to retain and attract investment professionals may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s profitability or result in an increase in the portion of ZAIS\u2019s performance fees that it grants to ZAIS\u2019s investment professionals.\n\u00b7 Many of the members of ZAIS\u2019s senior management team and ZAIS\u2019s senior investment professionals have entered into non-competition agreements with ZAIS. There is no guarantee that these individuals will not resign, join ZAIS\u2019s competitors or form a competing company, or that the non-competition provisions in agreements would be upheld by a court. If any of these events were to occur, ZAIS\u2019s business would be materially adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to Future Growth\nIf ZAIS is unable to execute development opportunities, it may not be able to implement its growth strategy successfully.\nZAIS\u2019s growth strategy includes both the expansion of certain of ZAIS\u2019s existing businesses, as well as the development and implementation of new business opportunities as well as the capital to fund them, for example, to comply with new risk retention rules for CLO issuers. The success of these growth initiatives will depend on, among other things: (a) the availability of suitable opportunities, (b) the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources, (c) ZAIS\u2019s ability to value potential development accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, (d) ZAIS\u2019s ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and delays, (e) ZAIS\u2019s ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with service providers and counterparties and (f) ZAIS\u2019s ability to properly manage conflicts of interest. If ZAIS is not successful in implementing its growth strategy, its business, results of operations and the market price for Class A Common Stock may be adversely affected.\nZAIS may enter into new businesses, make future strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in ZAIS\u2019s business.\nZAIS intends to grow its business by increasing AUM in existing businesses and creating new investment products. The capital raised from the Business Combination is expected to facilitate ZAIS\u2019s AUM growth, which has been affected in recent years, as noted above, by a generally challenging environment for ZAIS and other managers, in particular, those focused on credit products, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and declining interest rates causing structured credit products to be disfavored by investors. ZAIS may pursue growth through strategic investments, acquisitions or joint ventures, which may include entering into new lines of business, such as the insurance, broker-dealer or financial advisory industries. In addition, opportunities may arise for ZAIS to acquire other alternative or traditional asset managers. To the extent ZAIS makes strategic investments or acquisitions, enters into joint ventures, or enters into a new line of business, ZAIS will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with (i) the required investment of capital and other resources, (ii) the possibility that ZAIS has insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk, and (iii) combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls. Entry into certain lines of business may subject ZAIS to new laws and regulations with which it is not familiar, or from which ZAIS is currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business generates insufficient revenues or if ZAIS is unable to efficiently manage its expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. In the case of joint ventures, we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that ZAIS may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.\nZAIS utilizes third-party distribution sources to market certain of ZAIS\u2019s investment funds and strategies.\nZAIS\u2019s ability to grow ZAIS\u2019s AUM is partially dependent on third-party intermediaries, including investment banks, solicitation agents and broker-dealers. No assurance can be made that these intermediaries will continue to be accessible to ZAIS on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, pension fund consultants and other investment management consultants may review and evaluate ZAIS and ZAIS\u2019s institutional products from time to time. Poor reviews or evaluations of either a particular product, or of ZAIS, may result in institutional client withdrawals or may impair ZAIS\u2019s ability to attract new assets through these consultants.\nThe growth of ZAIS\u2019s business depends in large part on ZAIS\u2019s ability to raise capital from investors. If ZAIS is unable to raise such capital, it would be unable to collect management fees or deploy such capital into investments, which would materially and adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nZAIS\u2019s ability to raise capital from investors depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside ZAIS\u2019s control. Investors may downsize their investment allocations to rebalance a disproportionate weighting of their overall investment portfolio among asset classes. In the event of poor performance of ZAIS\u2019s funds, it could be more difficult for ZAIS to raise new capital. ZAIS\u2019s investors and potential investors continually assess ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 performance independently and relative to market benchmarks and ZAIS\u2019s competitors, and ZAIS\u2019s ability to raise capital for existing and future funds, including new CLO securitization that will require ZAIS to retain a portion of the vehicles on its balance sheet, depends on ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 performance. If economic and market conditions deteriorate, ZAIS may be unable to raise sufficient amounts of capital to support the investment activities of future funds. If ZAIS is unable to successfully raise capital, ZAIS\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe growth of ZAIS\u2019s existing businesses combined with ZAIS\u2019s new business initiatives may place significant demands on ZAIS\u2019s administrative, operational and financial resources.\nZAIS is contemplating certain growth initiatives, both in the expansion of ZAIS\u2019s existing business lines and in new businesses. This growth, if successful, will place significant demands on ZAIS\u2019s legal, accounting and operational infrastructure, and will result in increased expenses. In addition, ZAIS is required to continuously develop its systems and infrastructure in response to the increasing sophistication of the investment management market and legal, accounting, regulatory and tax developments. ZAIS\u2019s future growth will depend in part on ZAIS\u2019s ability to maintain an operating platform and management system sufficient to address ZAIS\u2019s growth and will require ZAIS to incur significant additional expenses and to commit additional senior management and operational resources. As a result, ZAIS faces significant challenges, including:\n\u00b7 maintaining adequate financial, regulatory (legal, tax and compliance) and business controls;\n\u00b7 implementing new or updated information and financial systems and procedures;\n\u00b7 training, managing and appropriately sizing ZAIS\u2019s work force and other components of ZAIS\u2019s businesses on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u00b7 mitigating the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ZAIS\u2019s core businesses;\n\u00b7 reducing the disruption of ZAIS\u2019s ongoing business;\n\u00b7 entering into markets or lines of business in which ZAIS may have limited or no experience;\n\u00b7 maintaining the required investment of capital and other resources; and\n\u00b7 complying with additional regulatory requirements.\nEntry into certain lines of business may subject ZAIS to new laws and regulations with which it is not familiar, or from which it is currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory enforcement risk. If a new business does not generate sufficient revenues or if ZAIS is unable to efficiently manage ZAIS\u2019s expanded operations, ZAIS\u2019s results of operations will be adversely affected. ZAIS\u2019s strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case it will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that it may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel that are not under ZAIS\u2019s control. Because ZAIS has not yet identified these potential new investment strategies, geographic markets or lines of business, ZAIS cannot identify all the risks it may face and the potential adverse consequences on ZAIS and any investment that may result from any attempted expansion.\nCertain of ZAIS\u2019s growth initiatives may be effectuated through seed investments in funds that ZAIS manages.\nCertain of ZAIS\u2019s growth initiatives, including an expanded CLO business, may be effectuated through seed investments in funds that ZAIS manages. As a seed investor, ZAIS may bear a disproportionate share of startup expenses related to the formation of a fund. It may be difficult for ZAIS to attract additional investors and it may never be successful in finding additional investors to invest in these newly formed funds where it has invested the capital. In such cases, the amount of investable capital would be constrained to the amount of capital invested in the fund by ZAIS and the fund may not be able to achieve the diversification or level of investments optimal to achieve the desired investment portfolio. Additionally, ZAIS may invest funds in a strategy in which it has little or no track record as an investment manager.\nThere is currently a limited market for securitization and the market for securitization products may not grow or expand, which could result in limitations on ZAIS\u2019s ability to effectuate certain of ZAIS\u2019s growth strategies.\nCurrently, there is a limited market for securitization and the market for securitization products may not grow or expand, which could result in limitations on ZAIS\u2019s ability to effectuate certain of ZAIS\u2019s growth strategies. Certain of ZAIS\u2019s growth initiatives rely on ZAIS\u2019s ability to purchase and securitize assets, including residential and commercial mortgage loans. If the market for securitization does not increase, ZAIS\u2019s ability to effectuate ZAIS\u2019s growth initiatives related to securitization may not be achievable.\nZAIS may engage in certain activities that require ZAIS to become a registered swap dealer, which may result in a significantly increased compliance and operational burden.\nAs part of its growth strategy, ZAIS may engage in certain activities that require ZAIS to become a registered swap dealer, which would result in a significantly increased compliance and operational burden. The Commodity Exchange Act (\u201cCEA\u201d) and related regulations impose significant compliance requirements on swap dealers in a number of areas, including capital and margin, reporting and recordkeeping, daily trading records, business conduct standards, documentation standards, monitoring of trading, risk management procedures, disclosure of information, ability to obtain information, conflicts of interest and segregation of collateral. Firms that wish to register as a swap dealer must have adequate documentation to support their compliance with these requirements, which may produce a significant additional compliance and operational burden on ZAIS to comply. Any failure to comply with these rules may subject ZAIS to regulatory action, may result in reputational harm and may affect the value of Class A Common Stock.\nZAIS may pursue becoming the investment manager to a registered investment company or to a fund that manages ERISA plan funds as part of ZAIS\u2019s growth strategy.\nAs part of its growth strategy, ZAIS may seek to raise capital, and become the investment manager or sub-adviser, for an investment fund registered under the 1940 Act or to Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) plan assets. Registered investment companies and funds managing capital for ERISA plan assets must adhere to complex and sometimes onerous restrictions promulgated under the 1940 Act and ERISA. To date, ZAIS has not served as an investment manager to either a registered investment company or a fund that is subject to the regulations promulgated under ERISA. Compliance with these regulations will place an increased burden on ZAIS\u2019s infrastructure professionals. It is likely that ZAIS will need to hire additional professionals to help ZAIS meet these additional demands on ZAIS\u2019s staff. As a result, no assurance can be made that ZAIS will be able to successfully operate these funds or comply with applicable regulatory requirements. If ZAIS fails to comply with the regulations it may be subject to regulatory action, litigation from investors and reputational harm, all of which may have a materially adverse impact on the value of Class A Common Stock.\nAn increase in interest rates may have an impact on ZAIS\u2019s ability to pursue certain of ZAIS\u2019s growth initiatives.\nRising interest rates generally reduce the demand for mortgage loans due to the higher cost of borrowing. A reduction in the volume of mortgage loans originated may affect the volume of assets available to purchase as part of ZAIS\u2019s growth strategies related to residential and commercial mortgage related assets. Rising interest rates may also cause assets that were issued prior to an interest rate increase to provide yields that are below prevailing market interest rates. If rising interest rates cause ZAIS to be unable to acquire a sufficient volume of these mortgage related assets with a yield that is above ZAIS\u2019s borrowing costs, ZAIS\u2019s ability to satisfy certain of ZAIS\u2019s growth initiatives and to generate income may be materially and adversely affected. The relationship between short-term and longer-term interest rates is often referred to as the \u201cyield curve.\u201d Ordinarily, short-term interest rates are lower than longer-term interest rates. If short-term interest rates rise disproportionately relative to longer-term interest rates (a flattening of the yield curve), ZAIS\u2019s borrowing costs may increase more rapidly than the interest income earned on ZAIS\u2019s assets. Because ZAIS expects its investments, on average, generally will bear interest based on longer-term rates than ZAIS\u2019s borrowings, a flattening of the yield curve would tend to decrease ZAIS\u2019s net income and the market value of ZAIS\u2019s net assets. Additionally, to the extent cash flows from investments that return scheduled and unscheduled principal are reinvested, the spread between the yields on the new investments and available borrowing rates may decline, which would likely decrease ZAIS\u2019s net income. It is also possible that short-term interest rates may exceed longer-term interest rates (a yield curve inversion), in which event ZAIS\u2019s borrowing costs may exceed ZAIS\u2019s interest income and it could incur operating losses.\nRisks Related to ZAIS\u2019s Regulatory Environment\nExtensive regulation affects ZAIS\u2019s activities, increases the cost of doing business and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties that could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s business and results of operations.\nZAIS\u2019s business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examination, by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The SEC oversees ZAIS\u2019s activities as a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The National Futures Association (the \u201cNFA\u201d) and the CFTC oversee ZAIS\u2019s activities as a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading adviser. In addition, ZAIS regularly relies on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the 1940 Act, the CEA and ERISA. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties whom ZAIS does not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to be revoked or challenged or otherwise become unavailable to ZAIS, ZAIS could become subject to regulatory enforcement action or third-party claims, which could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s business.\nRecently, the SEC has indicated that investment advisers who pay personnel transaction-based compensation for soliciting investments in the funds they advise, or who employ personnel solely responsible for marketing interests in the funds they advise, may be required to register as a broker-dealer. ZAIS does not believe it is required to register as a broker-dealer. Nevertheless, no assurance can be made that new regulations, or new interpretations of existing regulations, will not result in ZAIS being required to register as a broker-dealer. In such an event, ZAIS would incur potentially substantial additional compliance costs, including the need to hire additional personnel.\nSince 2010, states and other regulatory authorities have begun to require investment managers to register as lobbyists. ZAIS has registered as such in a number of jurisdictions where required. Other states or municipalities may consider similar legislation or adopt regulations or procedures with similar effect. These registration requirements impose significant compliance obligations on registered lobbyists and their employers, which may include annual registration fees, periodic disclosure reports and internal recordkeeping, and may also prohibit the payment of contingent fees.\nEach of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over ZAIS has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on or be compensated for particular activities. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the federal securities laws, including the Advisers Act\u2019s recordkeeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, could result in investigations, sanctions and reputational damage. ZAIS is involved regularly in trading activities that implicate both U.S. securities and commodities law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and technical trading requirements that implicate fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of these laws could result in severe restrictions on ZAIS\u2019s activities and damage to ZAIS\u2019s reputation.\nZAIS\u2019s failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of the registration of ZAIS\u2019s relevant subsidiaries as investment advisers. The regulations to which ZAIS\u2019s businesses are subject are designed primarily to protect investors in ZAIS\u2019s funds and to ensure the integrity of the financial markets. They are not designed to protect our stockholders. Even if a sanction imposed against ZAIS, one of ZAIS\u2019s subsidiaries or its personnel by a regulator is for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to the sanction could harm ZAIS\u2019s reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s businesses in a number of ways, making it harder for ZAIS to raise new funds and discouraging others from doing business with ZAIS.\nFailure to comply with \u201cpay to play\u201d regulations implemented by the SEC and certain states, and changes to the \u201cpay to play\u201d regulatory regimes, could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s businesses.\nIn recent years, the SEC and several states have initiated investigations alleging that certain private equity firms and hedge funds or agents acting on their behalf have paid money to current or former government officials or their associates in exchange for improperly soliciting contracts with state pension funds. In June 2010, the SEC approved Rule 206(4)-5 under the Advisers Act regarding \u201cpay to play\u201d practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to government officials able to exert influence on potential government entity clients. Among other restrictions, the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government entity for a period of up to two years, subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make contributions to certain elected candidates and officials in a position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government entity. An adviser is required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain of the adviser\u2019s employees and engagements of third parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records to enable the SEC to determine compliance with the rule. In addition, there have been similar rules on a state level regarding \u201cpay to play\u201d practices by investment advisers.\nAs public pension plans are investors in some of ZAIS\u2019s funds, these rules could result in significant economic sanctions on ZAIS\u2019s businesses if ZAIS or any of the other persons covered by the rules make any such contribution or payment, whether or not material or with an intent to secure an investment from a public pension plan, or may, for instance, provide a basis for the redemption of affected public pension fund investors. In addition, investigations relating to the foregoing activities may require the attention of senior management and may result in fines if ZAIS is deemed to have violated any regulations, thereby imposing additional expenses on us. Any failure on ZAIS\u2019s part to comply with these rules could cause ZAIS to lose compensation for ZAIS\u2019s advisory services or expose ZAIS to significant penalties and reputational damage.\nNew or changed laws or regulations governing ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 operations and changes in the interpretation thereof could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s business.\nThe laws and regulations governing the operations of ZAIS\u2019s funds, as well as their interpretation, may change from time to time, and new laws and regulations may be enacted. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations and changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by ZAIS\u2019s funds to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of ZAIS\u2019s business practices, negatively impact ZAIS\u2019s operations, AUM or financial condition, impose additional costs on ZAIS or otherwise adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s business. The following includes certain significant regulatory risks facing ZAIS\u2019s business:\n\u00b7 Changes in capital requirements may increase the cost of ZAIS\u2019s financing. If regulatory capital requirements - whether under the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III, or other regulatory action - were to be imposed on ZAIS\u2019s funds, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to others. Among other things, this could potentially require ZAIS\u2019s funds to sell assets at an inopportune time or price, which could negatively impact ZAIS\u2019s operations, AUM or financial condition.\n\u00b7 The imposition of additional legal or regulatory requirements could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which ZAIS conducts its businesses and adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s profitability. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes significant new regulations on nearly every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including new registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements on private fund investment advisers. Importantly, while several key aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been defined through final rules, their extent and impact are not yet fully known and may not be known for some time. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act remain outstanding and will be implemented by various regulatory bodies over the next several years. The imposition of any additional legal or regulatory requirements could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which ZAIS conducts its businesses and adversely affect the performance of ZAIS\u2019s funds or ZAIS\u2019s profitability.\n\u00b7 The implementation of the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d could have adverse implications on ZAIS\u2019s ability to raise funds from certain entities. In December 2013, the Federal Reserve and other federal regulatory agencies adopted a final rule implementing a section of the Dodd-Frank Act that has become known as the \u201cVolcker Rule.\u201d The Volcker Rule generally prohibits insured banks or thrifts, any bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, any non-U.S. bank with a U.S. branch, agency or commercial lending company and any subsidiaries and affiliates of such entities, regardless of geographic location, from investing in or sponsoring \u201ccovered funds,\u201d which generally include private equity funds or hedge funds and certain other collective investment vehicles and certain other proprietary activities. The Volcker Rule and interpretations thereunder are still uncertain and may not be known for some time. Nonetheless, the Volcker Rule is likely to curtail various banking activities that in turn could result in uncertainties in the financial markets as well as ZAIS\u2019s business. Although ZAIS does not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s funds or ZAIS\u2019s fundraising to any significant extent, there could be adverse implications on ZAIS\u2019s ability in the future to raise funds from the types of entities mentioned above as a result of this prohibition.\n\u00b7 Increased regulation on banks\u2019 leveraged lending activities could negatively affect the terms and availability of credit to ZAIS\u2019s funds. In March 2013, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation published revised guidance regarding expectations for banks\u2019 leveraged lending activities. This guidance, in addition the final risk retention rules issued jointly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the SEC in October 2014, could further restrict credit availability, as well as potentially restrict certain of ZAIS\u2019s investing activities that rely on banks\u2019 lending activities. This could negatively affect the terms and availability of credit to ZAIS\u2019s funds.\n\u00b7 New restrictions on compensation could limit ZAIS\u2019s ability to recruit and retain investment professionals. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes federal regulatory agencies to review and, in certain cases, prohibit compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct deemed to encourage inappropriate risk-taking by covered financial institutions. Such restrictions could limit ZAIS\u2019s ability to recruit and retain investment professionals and senior management executives.\nNew rules may make mortgage securitization more difficult to achieve.\nIn September 2014, the SEC adopted rules substantially revising Regulation AB requirements regarding the offering process, disclosure and reporting for publicly-issued asset-backed securities (the \u201cEnhanced Disclosure Rules\u201d). Among other things, publicly-issued asset-backed securities transactions issued after the effective date of the Enhanced Disclosure Rules will require enhanced loan-level disclosure containing information that is not included herein, as well as substantial additional loan-level information, and requirements for a review of underlying assets by an independent asset representations reviewer if certain trigger events occur. In addition, the SEC has not yet acted on certain rules initially proposed in April 2010 and re-proposed in July 2011 that would make the Enhanced Disclosure Rules applicable to private offerings issued in reliance on Rule 144A or Rule 506 of Regulation D at the request of the investor.\nDue to the expense of complying with Regulation AB, RMBS sponsors may be less inclined to issue RMBS in the future, thereby reducing investment opportunities for ZAIS. Furthermore, to the extent affiliates of ZAIS acquire mortgages in whole-loan form, the securitization of such mortgages may similarly be less efficient as a result of new compliance costs, therefore, adding to the expense of an important exit strategy.\nRisk retention requirements in Europe and the United States may make securitization of assets less profitable.\nYou should be aware of the requirements of Articles 404 through 410 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of 26 June, 2013) (the \u201cEU CRR\u201d). As of January 1, 2014, Articles 404 through 410 of the EU CRR have replaced Article 122a of the Capital Requirements Directive (Directive 2006/48/EC (as amended by Directive 2009/111/EC)) (the \u201cCRD\u201d). Article 122a of the CRD applied to credit institutions and holding companies of credit institutions incorporated in a Member State of the European Union and to their consolidated group entities, and imposed certain risk retention and ongoing due diligence requirements on these institutions, to the extent they invested in securitized assets. Effective as of January 1, 2014, Articles 404 through 410 of the EU CRR replaced Article 122a of the CRD. Articles 404 through 410 of the EU CRR have recast and extended the risk retention and diligence requirements of Article 122a of the CRD, including by extending their applicability to investment firms regulated within a Member State of the European Union assuming exposure to a securitization position. Furthermore, the guidelines on application of Article 122a of the CRD will be replaced by (i) the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 625/2014 dated March 13, 2014 (which came into force on July 3, 2014), supplementing Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 through regulatory technical standards specifying the requirements for investor, sponsor, original lenders and originator institutions relating to exposures to transferred credit risk, based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted to the European Commission by the European Banking Authority (the \u201cEBA\u201d) in accordance with Article 410(3) of the CRR (\u201cRegulation No. 625/2014\u201d), and (ii) the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 602/2014 (which came into force on June 25, 2014), approved by the European Commission and setting forth implementing technical standards for facilitating the convergence of supervisory practices with regard to the implementation of additional risk weights according to Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013, based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted to the European Commission by the EBA in accordance with Article 410(3) of the CRR (\u201cRegulation No. 602/2014\u201d).\nAs of the date of this report, it is not clear how the foregoing regulations will be implemented in each Member State of the European Union. No assurance can be given that the implementation throughout the European Union of the EU CRR and related legislation and regulations will not affect the requirements relating to investments in securitized assets applying to relevant investors.\nIt should also be noted that similar but not identical requirements to those set out in Articles 404 through 410 of the EU CRR have been finalized for alternative investment fund managers which are required to become authorized under the European Union\u2019s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (Directive 2011/61/EU) (the \u201cAIFMD\u201d). The AIFMD has been implemented in the Member States of the European Union pursuant to Section 5 of Regulation (EU) No 231/2013 (the \u201cAIFM Regulation\u201d); Articles 50 through 56 of the AIFM Regulation contain the risk retention and diligence requirements applicable to regulated alternative investment fund managers assuming exposure to securitization positions on behalf of one or more alternative investment funds they manage. Similar requirements are expected to be implemented for other types of European Union-regulated investors or investment managers (for example, insurance and reinsurance undertakings) in the future. Compliance with the increased regulatory burden imposed by the AIFMD may increase the operating expenses of ZAIS and ZAIS\u2019s funds as a result of higher compliance costs. In general, ZAIS\u2019s funds must comply with legal requirements, including requirements imposed by the AIFMD, securities laws, and company laws in various jurisdictions where ZAIS's funds are incorporated. Should any of these laws change or exemptions under these regulations cease to be available or desirable over the duration of the ZAIS\u2019s funds, the legal requirements to which the ZAIS\u2019s funds may be subject could differ substantially from current requirements.\nOn October 21 and 22, 2014, six United States federal agencies (including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the SEC, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency) adopted the US Risk Retention Regulations, which will become effective on the second anniversary of publication of the US Risk Retention Regulations in the U.S. Federal Register. Except with respect to asset-backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions, the US Risk Retention Regulations generally require securitizers of asset-backed securities to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing such asset-backed securities. For purposes of these regulations, ZAIS will most likely be the \u201csecuritizer\u201d for most CLOs it manages and most RMBS, CMBS or other asset-backed securities ZAIS originates. It is not possible to fully predict the impact of the US Risk Retention Regulations on the structured credit market, but it is possible that these new regulations may lead to reduced liquidity, a smaller market for new issuances and a general decrease in expected revenue and profit for entities (like ZAIS) acting as securitizer or investing in RMBS, CMBS, CLOs or other structured credit investments.\nAs a result of the rules discussed above, ZAIS will likely be required to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of any securitization transaction that ZAIS sponsors in a Member State of the European Union or the United States, as applicable.\nA number of the funds that ZAIS manages trade instruments that require ZAIS to be registered with the CFTC as a Commodity Trading Adviser and a Commodity Pool Operator.\nCertain funds that ZAIS manages trade instruments that require ZAIS to be registered with the CFTC as a Commodity Trading Adviser (\u201cCTA\u201d) and a Commodity Pool Operator (\u201cCPO\u201d). Registration as a CTA and CPO requires that ZAIS comply with a number of complex regulations and conduct ZAIS\u2019s business in compliance with certain restrictions placed on the activities of ZAIS\u2019s funds. Additionally, as a CTA and CPO, ZAIS is subject to examination by the NFA. The compliance infrastructure necessary to conduct ZAIS\u2019s business in accordance with these regulations is both costly and time consuming. If the NFA were to find that ZAIS is not conducting its business in accordance with these rules and regulations, it may be required to cease certain types of activities on behalf of ZAIS\u2019s funds. ZAIS\u2019s inability to conduct certain types of trades could impede the performance of these funds, may result in reputational harm to ZAIS and could have an impact on ZAIS\u2019s profitability.\nIn order to trade certain derivatives products, ZAIS must maintain its membership on a Swap Execution Facility (\u201cSEF\u201d) and be subject to the SEF\u2019s rules and regulations. Failure to maintain such membership, or failure to comply with the SEF\u2019s rules, could adversely impact ZAIS\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act now requires that certain types of cleared derivatives trades be executed on a SEF. SEFs are self-regulatory organizations for purposes of the CEA, and SEF members must agree to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEF, including rules regarding trading practices, disclosure obligations, financial reporting requirements and books and records requirements. Each SEF charges transaction fees, and some SEFs require that their members indemnify the SEF against certain losses or costs that may be incurred as a result of the transactions executed on the SEF.\nZAIS currently maintains membership on two SEFs and is subject to the rules of each such SEF. Any failure to comply with these rules may subject ZAIS to regulatory action, may result in reputational harm and may affect the value of Class A Common Stock. In addition, no assurance can be made that ZAIS will be able to maintain its membership on any SEF in the future, which would prevent ZAIS from trading those types of swaps that are required by regulation to be executed on a SEF. Any inability of ZAIS to participate fully in the derivatives market may result in ZAIS being unable to execute on a trading strategy, which could adversely impact ZAIS\u2019s business and its results of operations.\nWe could be subject to regulatory investigations, which could harm ZAIS\u2019s reputation and cause ZAIS\u2019s funds to lose existing investors or ZAIS to lose existing accounts or fail to attract new investors or accounts.\nThe failure by ZAIS to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions. Even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a fine or sanction or the fine or sanction imposed against ZAIS or ZAIS\u2019s employees by a regulator were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to an investigation, proceeding or imposition of these fines or sanctions could harm ZAIS\u2019s reputation and cause ZAIS\u2019s funds to lose existing investors or ZAIS to lose existing accounts or fail to attract new investors or accounts.\nZAIS is subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing ZAIS\u2019s operations. If it fails to comply with these laws, it could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nZAIS\u2019s operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where ZAIS does business. The Bribery Act, FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit ZAIS and ZAIS\u2019s employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. ZAIS\u2019s commercial partners operate in a number of jurisdictions that may pose a risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and ZAIS participates in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject ZAIS to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, ZAIS cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which ZAIS\u2019s internal operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nZAIS is also subject to other laws and regulations governing ZAIS\u2019s international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries or persons, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, or \u201cTrade Control Laws.\u201d\nThere is no assurance that ZAIS will be completely effective in ensuring its compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control Laws. If ZAIS is not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control Laws, it may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on ZAIS\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control Laws by U.K., U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on ZAIS\u2019s reputation, ZAIS\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Operation of ZAIS\u2019s Business\nWe are subject to risks in using custodians, counterparties, administrators, prime brokers, clearing and other agents.\nZAIS, in its capacity as an investment adviser, and some of ZAIS\u2019s funds depend on the services of custodians, counterparties, administrators, prime brokers and other agents to carry out certain financing, investment and derivatives transactions. The terms of these contracts are often customized and complex. In particular, some of ZAIS\u2019s funds utilize arrangements with a relatively limited number of counterparties, which has the effect of concentrating the transaction volume (and related counterparty default risk) of such funds with these counterparties.\nZAIS\u2019s funds are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the contract. Any such default may occur suddenly and without notice to ZAIS. Moreover, if a counterparty defaults, ZAIS may be unable to take action to cover ZAIS\u2019s exposure, either because ZAIS lacks contractual recourse or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. This inability could occur in times of market stress, which is when defaults are most likely to occur.\nIn addition, it may not be possible for ZAIS accurately predict the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition, and as a result, ZAIS may not be in a position to take sufficient action to reduce ZAIS\u2019s risks effectively. Default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, foresee or evaluate. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one large participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants, which may in turn expose ZAIS to significant losses.\nZAIS often has large positions with a single counterparty. For example, some of ZAIS\u2019s funds have credit lines. If the lender under one or more of those credit lines were to become insolvent, ZAIS may have difficulty replacing the credit line and one or more of ZAIS\u2019s funds may face liquidity problems.\nIn the event of a counterparty default, particularly a default by a major financial institution or a default by a counterparty to a significant number of ZAIS\u2019s contracts, one or more of ZAIS\u2019s funds may have outstanding trades that they cannot settle or are delayed in settling. As a result, these funds could incur material losses and the resulting market impact of a major counterparty default could harm ZAIS\u2019s businesses, results of operation and financial condition.\nIn the event of the insolvency of a prime broker, custodian, counterparty or any other party that is holding assets of ZAIS\u2019s funds as collateral, ZAIS\u2019s funds might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they may rank among the prime broker\u2019s, custodian\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s unsecured creditors in relation to the assets held as collateral. In addition, ZAIS has elected not to segregate any initial margin posted by ZAIS\u2019s funds to contractual counterparties in respect of any uncleared swaps entered into on or after November 3, 2014 in accordance with CFTC Rule 23.701. Because ZAIS\u2019s funds\u2019 cash will not be segregated from such counterparty\u2019s own cash and may not be segregated from the prime broker\u2019s, custodian\u2019s or other counterparty\u2019s own cash, ZAIS\u2019s funds may therefore rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto and ZAIS\u2019s funds will bear the risk of such losses. If ZAIS\u2019s derivatives transactions are cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, the CFTC has issued final rules regulating the segregation and protection of collateral posted by customers of cleared swaps.\nThe counterparty risks that ZAIS faces have increased in complexity and magnitude as a result of disruption in the financial markets in recent years. For example, the consolidation and elimination of counterparties has increased ZAIS\u2019s concentration of counterparty risk and decreased the universe of potential counterparties. ZAIS\u2019s funds are generally not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with a single counterparty. In addition, counterparties have generally reacted to recent market volatility by tightening their underwriting standards and increasing their margin requirements for all categories of financing, which has the result of decreasing the overall amount of leverage available and increasing the costs of borrowing.\nIn addition to the risks currently faced with respect to trades processed on an over-the-counter market, as more derivatives trades become subject to the CFTC\u2019s mandatory clearing rules, ZAIS will be required to consolidate these trades through ZAIS\u2019s registered futures commission merchant(s). Currently, ZAIS maintains only one such relationship which exposes ZAIS to counterparty concentration risk. There can be no assurances that ZAIS will, in the future, enter into agreements with additional futures commission merchants.\nZAIS is highly dependent on its information and communication systems; systems failures and other operational disruptions, including cyber-attacks, could significantly affect ZAIS\u2019s business, which may, in turn, negatively affect ZAIS\u2019s operating results.\nZAIS\u2019s business is highly dependent on its communications and information systems which may interface with or depend on systems operated by third parties, including market counterparties and other service providers. Any failure or interruption of these systems could cause delays or other problems in ZAIS\u2019s activities, including in ZAIS\u2019s target asset acquisition activities, which could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS\u2019s operating results and negatively affect the value of Class A Common Stock and ZAIS\u2019s ability to make distributions to its unitholders.\nAdditionally, ZAIS relies heavily on financial, accounting and other data processing systems and operational risks arising from mistakes made in the confirmation or settlement of transactions, from transactions not being properly booked, evaluated or accounted for or other similar disruption in ZAIS\u2019s operations may cause ZAIS to suffer financial loss, the disruption of ZAIS\u2019s business, liability to third parties, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\nZAIS also faces various security threats, including cyber security attacks to ZAIS\u2019s information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to ZAIS\u2019s proprietary information (including information of ZAIS\u2019s clients, investors and employees), destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage ZAIS\u2019s systems. These security threats could originate from a wide variety of sources, including unknown third parties. As with all financial institutions, we may be exposed to new and emerging cyber threats against which we are not immediately or adequately protected. Although ZAIS has not yet been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents and ZAIS utilizes various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to ZAIS\u2019s systems. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled for any reason or if there is any unauthorized disclosure of data, such as personal client, investor, borrower and employee information, whether as a result of tampering, a breach of ZAIS\u2019s network security systems, a cyber-incident or attack or otherwise, ZAIS could suffer financial loss, a disruption of ZAIS\u2019s businesses, liability to ZAIS, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. As ZAIS grows its business, these risks will become even greater as it has access to personally identifiable borrower information with respect to the newly originated mortgage loans that ZAIS\u2019s funds purchase.\nIn addition, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has recently warned that the greatest cyber threat to the U.S. and U.S.-based businesses is from China. Because ZAIS maintains an office in China and certain of ZAIS\u2019s systems are based in China, ZAIS is exposed to additional cyber-related threats. A cyber-attack in ZAIS\u2019s China office could compromise confidential information and result in a material adverse impact to ZAIS\u2019s business.\nAlthough ZAIS has back-up systems and cyber security and consumer protection measures in place, ZAIS\u2019s back-up procedures, cyber defenses and capabilities in the event of a failure, interruption, or breach of security may not be adequate. Insurance and other safeguards ZAIS uses may not be available or may only partially reimburse ZAIS for ZAIS\u2019s losses related to operational failures or cyber-attacks. In addition, ZAIS may choose to reimburse a client in the event of a trading error or under other circumstances, even if it is not legally required to do so, and any such reimbursements could adversely affect ZAIS\u2019s results of operations.\nAfter the Business Combination, and as ZAIS\u2019s client base, number of investment strategies or physical locations increase, developing and maintaining ZAIS\u2019s operational systems and infrastructure and protecting ZAIS\u2019s systems from cyber -attacks and threats may become increasingly challenging and costly, which could constrain ZAIS\u2019s ability to expand ZAIS\u2019s businesses. Any upgrades or expansions to ZAIS\u2019s operations or technology to accommodate increased volumes of transactions or otherwise may require significant expenditures and may increase the probability that ZAIS will suffer system interruptions and failures. ZAIS also depends substantially on its Red Bank, NJ office where a majority of ZAIS\u2019s employees, administration and technology resources are located, for the continued operation of ZAIS\u2019s business. Any significant disruption to that office could have a material adverse effect on ZAIS.\nIf ZAIS\u2019s risk management systems for ZAIS\u2019s asset management business are ineffective, ZAIS may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.\nZAIS\u2019s risk management techniques and strategies may not fully mitigate the risk exposure of ZAIS\u2019s funds in all economic or market environments, or against all types of risk, including risks that ZAIS might fail to identify or anticipate. Some of ZAIS\u2019s strategies for managing risk are based upon ZAIS\u2019s use of historical market behavior statistics. ZAIS applies statistical and other tools to these observations to measure and analyze the risks to which ZAIS\u2019s funds are exposed. Any failures in ZAIS\u2019s risk management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify such risk exposure could limit ZAIS\u2019s ability to manage risks in the funds or to seek adequate risk-adjusted returns. In addition, any risk management failures could cause fund losses to be significantly greater than the historical measures predict. Further, modeling does not take all risks into account. ZAIS\u2019s approach to managing those risks could prove insufficient, exposing ZAIS to material unanticipated losses.\nThe due diligence process ZAIS undertakes in connection with investments by its funds may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment.\nBefore making certain investments, ZAIS conducts due diligence that it deems reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to those investments. When conducting due diligence, ZAIS may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisors, service providers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, ZAIS relies on the resources available to it, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third-party investigations. The due diligence investigation that ZAIS will carry out with respect to any investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity. Moreover, such an investigation will not necessarily result in the investment being successful.\nZAIS utilizes analytical models and data in connection with the valuation of ZAIS\u2019s investments and the investments of ZAIS\u2019s funds, and any incorrect, misleading or incomplete information used in connection therewith would subject ZAIS to potential risks.\nGiven the complexity of ZAIS\u2019s investment strategies, ZAIS relies heavily on analytical models (both proprietary models and those supplied by third parties) and information supplied by third parties. Models and data will be used to value potential target assets and also in connection with hedging ZAIS\u2019s acquisitions and those of ZAIS\u2019s funds. In the event models and data prove to be incorrect, misleading or incomplete, any decisions made in reliance thereon expose ZAIS to potential risks. For example, by relying on incorrect models and data, especially valuation models, ZAIS may be induced to buy assets at prices that are too high, to sell certain other assets at prices that are too low or to miss favorable opportunities altogether. Similarly, any hedging based on faulty models and data may prove to be unsuccessful.\nZAIS relies on intellectual property to conduct ZAIS\u2019s business and any disruption to this intellectual property could impede ZAIS\u2019s ability to carry out ZAIS\u2019s existing business and ZAIS\u2019s growth initiatives.\nZAIS\u2019s business is dependent on the use of intellectual property, including intellectual property licensed from third parties and certain protected intellectual property that it has developed. Many of ZAIS\u2019s investments are based off of ZAIS\u2019s analytical models and the systems that generate these models. There are a number of risks associated with ZAIS\u2019s intellectual property including the risk that:\n\u2022 the third party licensing certain intellectual property to ZAIS is no longer willing to license such intellectual property to ZAIS, or is unwilling to license the intellectual property to ZAIS at a price that it is willing to pay;\n\u2022 the intellectual property that ZAIS has developed is stolen or sabotaged;\n\u2022 the intellectual property that ZAIS has developed becomes obsolete and ZAIS is unable to develop new intellectual property to replace the outdated systems, models or software; and\n\u2022 ZAIS is unable to retain or attract competent employees who are able to maintain and further develop such intellectual property.", "PERMNO": 13827, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "ZAIS"}
