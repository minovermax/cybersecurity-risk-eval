{"cik": "1422892", "company": "Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not have sufficient liquidity to execute our business plan or to continue our operations without obtaining additional funding or selling additional securities. We may not be able to obtain additional funding under commercially reasonable terms or issue additional securities.\nWe reported a net loss attributable to Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. of approximately $2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, compared to approximately $0.7 million of net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $4.5 million.\nAs of June 30, 2016, we had $1.4 million in cash or cash equivalents. Our management believes that we will have sufficient liquidity in fiscal year 2017 to finance our anticipated operations, as well as achieve projected cash collections from customers. Additionally, we may enter into new business segments through selected merger and acquisitions that may require us to obtain additional funding or issue additional securities. Changes in our business conditions or the financial markets could limit our access to existing credit facilities or make new sources of financing more costly or commercially unviable. Changes in China\u2019s currency exchange control regulations could also limit our ability to access cash outside of China to meet liquidity requirements for our planned operations or intended acquisitions in China. If additional funding is not obtained, we may need to reduce, defer or cancel development programs to the extent necessary. The failure to fund our capital requirements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations.\nFounded in the US in 2001, we have a relatively limited operating history. Accordingly, you should consider our future prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties typically experienced by companies such as ours in evolving industries. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to:\n\u2022 offer new and innovative solutions to attract new customers and retain existing customer base;\n\u2022 raise sufficient funding to sustain and expand our business;\n\u2022 maintain effective control of our costs and expenses;\n\u2022 respond to changes in market demand and regulatory environment;\n\u2022 manage risks associated with intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022 maintain or improve our position as an innovative global logistic solution provider.\nIf we are unsuccessful in addressing any of these risks and uncertainties, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have historically relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our business.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we commenced providing shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services to a single customer, the Zhiyuan Investment Group, an entity controlled by Mr. Zhang, our largest shareholder. We temporarily suspended our shipping and chartering services in fiscal year 2016 as a result of the termination of the vessel acquisition. The nature of our business is driven by the needs of our clients, and we cannot predict when, or if ever, we will receive another order for our services from the Zhiyuan Investment Group. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, $2,269,346 (or 31%) and $2,545,009 (or 22.5%) of our net revenues, respectively, resulted from providing inland transportation management services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 $1,977,996 (or 69%) and $2,143,606 (or 39.8%) of our gross profit, respectively, came from providing inland transportation management services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group. If we do not provide inland transportation management services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group in the future, our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Further, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to replace this customer with one or more new customers of similar size. In fiscal year 2015, we commenced providing inland transportation management services to a third-party customer Tengda. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, Tengda accounted for approximately 27% and 20% of the Company\u2019s total net revenues, respectively. Our business will be materially and adversely affected if we fail to retain any of these key customers or our collaborative partners over whom we are very dependent fail to perform as expected.\nWe have limited operating history in inland transportation management services businesses and cannot guarantee that we will be able to operate well and compete effectively in this business area.\nPrior to fiscal year 2014, our sole line of business was providing shipping agency services. We expanded our services to include inland transportation management services in the quarter ended December 31, 2013. As we are a fairly new entrant into this business line, we do not have a significant market presence. Currently, we only provide inland transportation services to two customers: the Zhiyuan Investment Group and Tengda. We may not have been able to enter into this business line without our relationship with Mr. Zhang, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in securing and providing inland transportation management services contracts for other customers on acceptable terms, if at all. We may not be able to retain our existing customers as the proprietary rights of our solutions are not protected and our customers could terminate the business relationship with us after they have mastered the skills to solve the problems. In addition, we may not be able to fully collect our outstanding accounts receivable within a reasonable time frame as Chinese economy is slowing resulting in the shipping business gets scaled down.\nWe recently established Sino LA to provide cargo forwarding services in the US and cannot guarantee that we will be able to operate successfully and compete effectively in this business area.\nIn fiscal year 2016, the Company formed a new subsidiary Sino LA and signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Yaxin International Co., Ltd. to provide cargo forwarding, customs filing and declaration, trucking and other related services. If we are not able to successfully retain this customer, we may not be able to compete effectively in this business location and acquire new customers as it is a highly competitive market. In addition, this particular industry has a standardized three months of payment term that might increase the pressure on our operating cash flow.\nThe fees that we received from the Zhiyuan Investment Group for our shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services may not be indicative of the fees that we may receive for the same services provided to unaffiliated customers and may be materially lower, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that the fees we have received from the Zhiyuan Investment Group for our shipping and chartering and inland transportation management services are indicative of the fees that we may receive if we are able to obtain non-affiliated customers for these services. The fees that we may receive from non-affiliated customers may be less than what we have received from our affiliated customer, and could possibly be so low as to make these lines of business unprofitable, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could require us to terminate such service lines.\nOur revenue will be materially and adversely affected if our new service offerings does not gain market acceptance.\nOur new service offerings may not gain market acceptance in the shipping logistic industry. To directly market and offer our service offerings, we and/or our collaborative partners may require a marketing and sales force with appropriate technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities. We may not be able to further establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into arrangements with third parties on acceptable terms. If we or our partners cannot successfully promote our new services, our ability to generate additional revenue will be limited.\nWe have entered into a number of business arrangements that are significant to us with two of our shareholders including Mr. Zhang, our largest shareholder, and through Mr. Zhang, the Zhiyuan Investment Group, who is controlled by Mr. Zhang. The failure to maintain our business relationship with either or both of such shareholders would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn April 2013, as approved by our Board of Directors and shareholders, Mr. Zhang purchased 1,800,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $3 million, which as of the date of this report represents approximately 21.6% of our issued and outstanding common stock, resulting in Mr. Zhang becoming our largest shareholder. As a result of Mr. Zhang\u2019s desire to find business opportunities that would mutually benefit us and the Zhiyuan Investment Group, a company controlled by Mr. Zhang, which owns a number of businesses in China, in June 2013, we signed a 5-year Global Logistic Service Agreement with two parties, one of which was the Zhiyuan Investment Group and the other was TEWOO Chemical & Light Industry Zhiyuan Trade Co., Ltd. (\u201cTewoo\u201d). Thereafter, during the quarter ended September 30, 2013, we executed a shipping and chartering services agreement with the Zhiyuan Investment Group, pursuant to which we assisted the Zhiyuan Investment Group in the transportation of approximately 51,000 tons of chromite ore from South Africa to China; and in September 2013, we executed an inland transportation management service contract with the Zhiyuan Investment Group pursuant to which we agreed to provide certain advisory services and assist the Zhiyuan Investment Group in attempting to control its potential commodities loss during the transportation process. On a one time basis, we executed a one year short-term loan agreement with the Zhiyuan Investment Group, effective January 1, 2014, to facilitate the working capital needs of the Zhiyuan Investment Group. During fiscal year 2016 and 2015 we continued to provide inland transportation management services to the Zhiyuan Investment Group. The net amount due to us from the Zhiyuan Investment Group at June 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $1.6 million and $2.6 million of trade receivables, respectively.\nAs a result of our business relationship with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang, we added shipping and chartering, inland transportation management and ship management services to our service platform. Such shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services generated approximately 66% and 91% of our net revenues and gross profit in fiscal year 2016, respectively, approximately 42% and 75% of our net revenues and gross profit, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nBased upon the above, the failure by us to maintain our existing business relationship with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wang would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe shipping agency business is very competitive in nature and many of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have.\nIn connection with shipping agency service, our main competitors include: LBH Group and Gulf Agency Company. These competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and name recognition than we have. In addition, we also face competition from a large number of smaller, local shipping agents. Our competitors may introduce new business models, and if these new business models are more attractive to customers than the business models we currently use, our customers may switch to our competitors\u2019 services, and we may lose market share. We believe that competition in worldwide shipping agency industry may become more intense as more shipping agencies, including Chinese/foreign joint ventures, are qualified to conduct business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against any new or existing competitors, or against any new business models our competitors may implement. In addition, the increased competition we anticipate in the shipping agent industry may also reduce the number of vessels for which we are able to provide shipping agency services, or cause us to reduce agency fees in order to attract or retain customers. All of these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe believe that our competitors in the inland transportation management services business, have greater name recognition, significantly more experience, financial, marketing and other resources than we have and we expect to face intense competition in this business segment.\nWe launched the inland transportation management services business in December 2013. Our competitors have greater experience and name recognition than we do, which is a competitive disadvantage to us. Further, our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial and marketing resources than we have, which also puts us at a significant competitive disadvantage. Since larger competitors may be able to offer the same services we offer at lower rates than what we would need to charge to operate profitably, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nThe barriers to enter into the business segments in which we operate are low and we may face competition from new entrants into these business segments.\nThe number of competitors offering the same services that we do may increase in the future since the barriers to entry are low. Increases in competition could lead to revenue reductions, reduced profit margins, or a loss of market share, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur customers are engaged in the shipping industry, and, consequently, our financial performance is dependent upon the economic conditions of that industry.\nWe derive our revenues from providing services to customers in the business of shipping materials to China and our success is dependent upon our customer\u2019s shipping needs. Our customers\u2019 shipping needs are intrinsically linked to economic conditions in the shipping industry in general and trade with China in particular. The shipping industry, in turn, is subject to intense competitive pressures and is affected by overall economic conditions. Accordingly, demand for our services could be harmed by instability or downturns in the shipping industry, reductions in trade between China and other countries or a combination of both which could materially lower demand or cause our customers to forego the shipping agency services we provide by attempting to provide such services in-house. If any of the foregoing occurs, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nWe may be required to assume liabilities for our clients in the future.\nAn increasing number of companies that require shipping agency services have pressured shipping agents to guarantee their clients\u2019 liabilities. Some companies have required shipping agents, as a condition of doing business, to pay for tariffs, port charges, and other fees, or to pay these fees with the promise of reimbursement at a later date. Other companies have sought to include shipping agents as parties in voyage charter agreements, leading to potential liability for shipping agents in the event of a breach by another party. We expect that these pressures on shipping agents to accept more liability will increase as competition among shipping agencies intensifies. While we do not currently pay these liabilities and have no present intention to begin doing so in the future, the assumption of any of these or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are heavily dependent upon the services of experienced personnel who possess skills that are valuable in our industry, and we may have to actively compete for their services.\nWe are a small company with limited resources, and we compete in large part on the basis of the quality of services we are able to provide our clients. As a result, we are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate skilled personnel to serve our clients. Many of our personnel possess skills that would be valuable to other companies engaged in one or more of our business lines. Consequently, we expect that we will have to actively compete with other Chinese shipping agencies to retain these employees. Some of our competitors may be able to pay our employees more than we are able to pay to retain them. Our ability to profitably operate is substantially dependent upon our ability to locate, hire, train and retain our personnel. Although we have not experienced difficulty locating, hiring, training or retaining our employees to date, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel, or that we will be able to attract and assimilate other qualified personnel in the future. If we are unable to effectively obtain and maintain skilled personnel, the quality of the shipping services that we provide could be materially impaired, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are substantially dependent upon our key personnel.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. In particular, the services of:\n\u2022 Mr. Lei Cao, Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022 Ms. Tuo Pan, Acting Chief Financial Officer; and\n\u2022 Mr. Zhikang Huang, Chief Operating Officer\nwould be difficult for us to replace. While we have employment contracts with each of our executive officers, such contracts may be terminated in certain circumstances by the executive officers. Moreover, we do not have any \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could substantially impair our ability to effectively execute our business and expand our service platform, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe need to maintain our relationships with local shipping agents.\nOur shipping agency business is dependent upon our relationships with local agents operating in the ports where our customers ship their products. As a general agent, substantially all of our shipping agency revenues have been derived from services delivered by the local agents and we believe local agent relationships will remain critical to our success in the future. We have a number of local agents that account for a significant portion of our business, the loss of one or more of which could materially and negatively impact our ability to retain and service our customers. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain and expand our existing local agent relationships or enter into new local agent relationships, or that new or renewed local agent relationships will be available on commercially reasonable terms. If we are unable to maintain and expand our existing local agent relationships, renew existing local agent relationships, or enter into new local agent relationships, we may lose customers, customer introductions and co-marketing benefits, and our business and results of operations may suffer significantly.\nWe are dependent on third party carriers and inland transportation companies to transport our client\u2019s cargo.\nWe rely on commercial ocean freight carriers and inland transportation companies, for the movement of our client\u2019s cargo. Consequently, our ability to provide services for our clients could be adversely impacted by: shortages in available cargo capacity; changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling, pricing, payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel, taxes and labor; and other factors not within our control. Reductions in ocean freight capacity could negatively impact our yields. Material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation, whether caused by strike, work stoppage, lock-out, slowdown or otherwise, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to effectively manage our cost structure as we grow the business.\nAs we continue to attempt to increase our revenues through the expansion of our service offerings, we must maintain an appropriate cost structure to maintain and increase our profitability. While we intend to increase our revenues by increasing the number and quality of the shipping services we provide by strategic acquisitions, and by maintaining and expanding our gross profit margins by reducing costs, our profitability will be driven in large part by our ability to manage our agent commissions, personnel and general and administrative costs as a function of our net revenues. There can be no assurances that we will be able to effectively control our costs and failure to do so would result in lack of profitability, which would have a material adverse effect our business and results of operations.\nComparisons of our operating results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to fluctuate in the future because of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In fiscal year 2016 and 2015 a substantial portion of our revenues was derived from the Zhiyuan Investment Group whose business we believe are tied closely to economic trends and consumer demand that can be difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that our historic operating performance will continue in future periods as we cannot assume or provide any assurance that the Zhiyuan Investment Group will continue to utilize our services, or have the same level of demand for our services that it had in fiscal year 2016 and 2015. Because our quarterly revenues and operating results vary significantly, comparisons of our period-to-period results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance.\nWe have not paid any dividends and we do not foresee paying dividends in the future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, if ever. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, Virginia and PRC laws, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nForeign Operational Risks\nWe do not have business liability or disruption insurance.\nWe do not have any business liability or disruption insurance coverage for our operations. Any business interruption, litigation or natural disaster may result in our business incurring substantial costs and the diversion of resources.\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with our VIE for our operations, which may not be as effective in providing control over these entities as direct ownership.\nAlthough we have temporarily suspended doing business through our VIE, Sino-China, our operations and financial results might in the future dependent on it, in which we have no equity ownership interest and must rely on contractual arrangements to control and operate the businesses of our VIE. These contractual arrangements are not as effective in providing control over the VIE as direct ownership. For example, the VIE may be unwilling or unable to perform its contractual obligations under our commercial agreements. Consequently, we would not be able to conduct our operations in the manner currently planned. In addition, the VIE may seek to renew its agreements on terms that are disadvantageous to us. Although we have entered into a series of agreements that provide us with substantial ability to control the VIE, we may not succeed in enforcing our rights under them insofar as our contractual rights and legal remedies under PRC law are inadequate. In addition, if we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms when these agreements expire or enter into similar agreements with other parties, our business may not be able to operate or expand, and our operating expenses may significantly increase.\nIn January 2015, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce unveiled a draft legislation that could change how the government is regulating corporate structures, especially for VIEs controlled by foreign investments. Instead of looking at \u201cownership\u201d, the draft law focused on the entities or individuals hold control of a VIE. If a VIE is deemed to be controlled by foreign investors, it may be barred from operating in restricted sectors or the prohibited sectors listed on a \u201cnegative list\u201d, where only companies controlled by Chinese nationals could operate, even if structured as VIEs. As of the report date, no formal legislation has been implemented.\nIn the event that the draft law is implemented in any form, and that the Company\u2019s business was characterized as one of the \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d sectors, the VIE the Company currently maintains contractual arrangements with may be barred from operation which may adversely affect our business if the market for shipping agent services turn around and we intend to resume such business operation with our VIE.\nThe economy of China had experienced unprecedented growth. This growth has slowed in the recent years, and if the growth of the economy continues to slow or if the economy contracts, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe rapid growth of the PRC economy had historically resulted in widespread growth opportunities in industries across China. This growth has slowed in the recent years. As a result of the global financial crisis and the inability of enterprises to gain comparable access to the same amounts of capital available in past years, there may be an adverse effect on the business climate and growth of private enterprise in the PRC. An economic slowdown could have an adverse effect on our sales and may increase our costs. Further, if economic growth continues to slow, and if, in conjunction, inflation is to proceed unchecked, our costs would likely to increase, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to increase our prices to an extent that would offset the increase in our expenses.\nIn addition, a tightening of the labor markets in our geographic region may result in fewer qualified applicants for job openings in our facilities. Further, higher wages, related labor costs and other increasing cost trends may negatively impact our results.\nUncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system could have a material adverse effect on us and may restrict the level of legal protections to foreign investors\nChina's legal system is based on statutory law. Unlike the common law system, statutory law is based primarily on written statutes. Previous court decisions may be cited as persuasive authority but do not have a binding effect. Since 1979, the PRC government has been promulgating and amending the laws and regulations regarding economic matters, such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new, and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretation of many laws, regulations and rules is not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to us.\nIn addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management's attention. The legal system in China cannot provide investors with the same level of protection as in the U.S. The Company is governed by laws and regulations generally applicable to local enterprises in China. Many of these laws and regulations were recently introduced and remain experimental in nature and subject to changes and refinements. Interpretation, implementation and enforcement of the existing laws and regulations can be uncertain and unpredictable and therefore may restrict the legal protections available to foreign investors.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions based on United States or foreign laws against us, our management or the experts named in the prospectus.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations in China and almost all of our assets are located in China. In addition, almost all of our senior executive officers reside in China. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process on our senior executive officers within the United States or elsewhere outside China, including with respect to matters arising under U.S. federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws. Moreover, our PRC counsel has advised us that the PRC does not have treaties with the United States or many other countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court orders and final judgments.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment.\nIn the course of providing services for international shipments, we occasionally require currencies from other countries to conduct our business. While we believe that we have complied with applicable currency control laws and regulations in all material aspects, we cannot guarantee you that our efforts will be free from challenge or that, if challenged, we will be successful in our defense of our current practices. Under our current corporate structure, our income is paid in different currencies, depending on our agreements with individual customers. We then pay in local currencies the expenses associated with operating a company in several countries. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our ability to pay such expenses unless and until we convert currencies that we have into those that we require.\nOne of the currencies we often convert among is the RMB. The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of bank loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends, if any, in foreign currencies to our shareholders.\nChanges in Currency Conversion Policies in China may have a material adverse effect on us.\nRenminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d) is still not a freely exchangeable currency. Since 1998, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China has promulgated a series of circulars and rules in order to enhance verification of foreign exchange payments under a Chinese entity's current account items, and has imposed strict requirements on borrowing and repayments of foreign exchange debts from and to foreign creditors under the capital account items and on the creation of foreign security in favor of foreign creditors.\nThis may complicate foreign exchange payments to foreign creditors under the current account items and thus may affect the ability to borrow under international commercial loans, the creation of foreign security, and the borrowing of RMB under guarantees in foreign currencies. Moreover, the value of RMB may become subject to supply and demand, which could be largely impacted by international economic and political environments. Any fluctuations in the exchange rate of RMB could have an adverse effect on the operational and financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries in China.\nFluctuation in the value of the RMB may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nThe change in value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar, the Euro and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions, among other things. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy has resulted in an appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. While the international reaction to the RMB revaluation has generally been positive, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. As a portion of our costs and expenses is denominated in RMB, the revaluation in July 2005 and potential future revaluation has and could further increase our costs. In addition, any significant revaluation of the RMB may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. For example, starting from the second half year of 2015, RMB started to depreciate vs. U.S. dollars and the trend continued in the beginning of year 2016, which cause our assets depreciated accordingly while we translated our balance sheet from RMB into U.S. Dollars. And the whole year revenue and net income was also negatively impacted by RMB depreciation.\nChanges in China\u2019s political and economic policies could harm our business.\nChina\u2019s economy has historically been a planned economy subject to governmental plans and quotas and has, in certain aspects, been transitioning to a more market-oriented economy. Although we believe that the economic reform and the macroeconomic measures adopted by the Chinese government have had a positive effect on the economic development of China, we cannot predict the future direction of these economic reforms or the effects these measures may have on our business, financial position or results of operations. In addition, the Chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These differences include:\n\u2022 economic structure;\n\u2022 level of government involvement in the economy;\n\u2022 level of development;\n\u2022 level of capital reinvestment;\n\u2022 control of foreign exchange;\n\u2022 methods of allocating resources; and\n\u2022 balance of payments position.\nAs a result of these differences, our business may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the Chinese economy were similar to those of the OECD member countries.\nSince 1979, the Chinese government has promulgated many new laws and regulations covering general economic matters. Despite this activity to develop a legal system, China\u2019s system of laws is not yet complete. Even where adequate law exists in China, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain or sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of China\u2019s judiciary, in many cases, creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Our activities in China will also be subject to administration review and approval by various national and local agencies of China\u2019s government. Because of the changes occurring in China\u2019s legal and regulatory structure, we may not be able to secure the requisite governmental approval for our activities. Although we have obtained all required governmental approval to operate our business as currently conducted, to the extent we are unable to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals, the Chinese government may, in its sole discretion, prohibit us from conducting our business.\u201d\nThe Chinese government could change its policies toward private enterprise or even nationalize or expropriate private enterprises, which could result in the total loss of our investment in that country.\nOur business is subject to significant political and economic uncertainties and may be adversely affected by political, economic and social developments in China. Over the past several years, the Chinese government has pursued economic reform policies including the encouragement of private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. The Chinese government may not continue to pursue these policies or may significantly alter them to our detriment from time to time with little, if any, prior notice.\nChanges in policies, laws and regulations or in their interpretation or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, restrictions or prohibitions on dividend payments to shareholders, devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on our business. Nationalization or expropriation could even result in the total loss of our investment in China and in the total loss of your investment in us.\nAs some of our directors, officers and assets are outside the United States, it will be extremely difficult to acquire jurisdiction and enforce liabilities against us and our officers, directors and assets based in China.\nSome of our directors and officers reside outside the United States. In addition, many of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or officers and our subsidiaries, or enforce against any of them court judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments relating to United States federal securities laws. Furthermore, because the majority of our assets are located in China and PRC does not have treaties with the United States or many other countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts, it would also be extremely difficult to access those assets to satisfy an award entered against us in United States court.\nOur international operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. regulations.\nIn addition to the Chinese laws and regulations with which we must comply, we must also comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits U.S. companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage. Any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees and agents comply with the FCPA and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties and/or restrictions in our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, entities and individuals based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals. As a result, we are restricted from entering into transactions with certain targeted foreign countries, entities, and individuals except as permitted by OFAC, which could reduce our future growth.\nRisks Related to the Common Stock\nThe market price for our securities may be subject to wide fluctuations.\nThe securities of a number of companies with substantial operations in China have experienced wide fluctuations in their stock price. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are risk factors described in this section and other factors, including:\n\u2022 announcements of competitive developments, by our competitors;\n\u2022 regulatory developments of our industry affecting us, our customers or our competitors;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 failure of our quarterly financial and operating results to meet market expectations or failure to meet our previously announced guidance, if any;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u2022 changes in the economic performance or market valuations of our competitors;\n\u2022 additions or departures of our executive officers and other key personnel;\n\u2022 announcements regarding intellectual property litigation (or potential litigation) involving us or any of our directors and officers;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi; and\n\u2022 release or expiration of the underwriters\u2019 post-offering lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding common stock.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular industries or companies. In addition, the market prices and trading volumes of companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market have been volatile. As a result, the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u00b7 variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in expectations of our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 changes in operating and stock price performance of other companies in our industry;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel; and\nfuture sales of our common stock.\nDomestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance, may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe may need additional capital and may sell additional securities or other equity securities or incur indebtedness, which could result in additional dilution to our shareholders or increase our debt service obligations.\nIn the future, we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities or equity-linked debt securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available, if at all, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us.\nSubstantial future sales of our securities in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the price of our securities to decline.\nAdditional sales of our securities in the public market or the perception that these sales could cause the market price of our securities to decline. In addition, we may grant or sell additional options, restricted shares or other share-based awards in the future under our share incentive plan to our management, employees and other persons, the settlement and sale of which may further dilute our shares and drive down the price of our securities.\nIf NASDAQ were to delist our securities from trading on its exchange, such action could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. We cannot assure you that our securities will meet the continued listing requirements be listed on NASDAQ in the future.\nIf NASDAQ delists our common stock from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u2022 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022 a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u2022 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf our shares of common stock become subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules, broker-dealers may experience difficulty in completing customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.\nIf our common stock were removed from listing with the NASDAQ Capital Market, it may be subject to the so-called \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. Investors in penny stocks should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose their whole investment.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\nBecause our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and NASDAQ, have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Because new and modified laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Securities\nMr. Lei Cao, our CEO and Chairman of our Board of Directors is the beneficial owner of a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock, which may enable Mr. Cao to exert significant influence on corporate actions.\nMr. Cao has 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of September 8, 2016, which could have a substantial impact on matters requiring the vote of our shareholders, including the election of our directors and most corporate actions. This control could delay, defer or prevent others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change in our control, even if these actions would benefit our other shareholders and the Company. This control could adversely affect the voting and other rights of our other shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe limitation of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Virginia law and the existence of statutory indemnification rights of our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our Company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur articles of incorporation do not contain any specific provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our Company and shareholders; however, we are prepared to indemnify our directors and officers to the extent provided for by Virginia law. We may also have included contractual indemnification obligations in our employment agreements with our officers. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in the Company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against its directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our Company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our Company and shareholders.", "PERMNO": 92688, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "SINO"}
