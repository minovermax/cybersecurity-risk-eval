{"cik": "1292556", "company": "Polypore International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces many risks. As such, prospective investors and shareholders should carefully consider and evaluate all of the risk factors described below. These risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended, supplemented, or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K that we file with the SEC in the future.\nOur proposed transactions with 3M and Asahi Kasei may cause disruption in our business and, if the proposed transactions do not occur, we will have incurred significant expenses, may need to pay a termination fee and our stock price may decline.\nOn February 23, 2015, we entered into integrated transactions with 3M, Asahi Kasei and EMS, pursuant to which we will sell our separations media business to 3M and, immediately thereafter, will be merged with EMS. In connection with the integrated transactions, at the time of the merger, each share of our common stock (other than any (a) dissenting shares, (b) shares owned by Asahi Kasei and EMS, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries (which will be cancelled)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive $60.50 in cash without interest, payable to the holder of such share. Each option to purchase shares of our common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will immediately accelerate and vest and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a payment in cash of an amount, subject to the amount of any required tax withholding, equal to the product of the total number of shares of our common stock subject to such cancelled option and the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of the option; provided that any such option with respect to which the exercise price per share subject to the option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration. Each restricted share of our common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will immediately accelerate and vest and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a payment in cash of an amount, subject to the amount of any tax withholding, equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest, treating such restricted share in the same manner as the other shares of our common stock.\nThe integrated transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder approval. Furthermore, we have the right to terminate the integrated transactions if we enter into a definitive agreement for an alternative transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal,\nprovided we comply with certain notice and other requirements, including paying Asahi Kasei and 3M a termination fee equal to $39.0 million and $16.8 million, respectively. Certain other actions by us causing termination of the integrated transactions could result in our being required to pay the foregoing termination fees to Asahi Kasei and 3M.\nThe announcement of the proposed integrated transactions, whether or not consummated, may result in a loss of key personnel and may disrupt our sales, strategic growth initiatives, research and development or other key business activities, which may have an impact on our financial performance. The agreements governing the integrated transactions generally require us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the proposed transactions, but include certain contractual restrictions on the conduct of our business that may affect our ability to execute on our business strategies and attain our financial goals. Additionally, the announcement of the integrated transactions, whether or not consummated, may impact our relationships with third parties, including suppliers, customers and others.\nThe consummation of the integrated transactions is subject to certain conditions, including, among others: (1) adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of the Company, (2) expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other consents and approvals required under applicable antitrust laws, (3) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the integrated transactions, (4) the absence of certain governmental actions, (5) the absence of a material adverse effect on either the separations media business or the remaining business of the Company, (6) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of representations and warranties of the Company, Asahi Kasei, EMS and 3M and (7) the performance or compliance by the Company, Asahi Kasei, EMS and 3M with their respective covenants and agreements.\nWe cannot predict whether the closing conditions for the integrated transactions will be satisfied. As a result, we cannot assure that the integrated transactions will be completed. If the closing conditions for the integrated transactions are not satisfied or waived, or if the transactions are not completed for any other reason, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, if the integrated transactions do not occur, we will nonetheless remain liable for significant expenses that we have incurred related to the transactions.\nBecause the specialized markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive, we may have difficulty growing our business.\nThe markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. Many of these markets require highly specialized products that are time and cost intensive to design and develop. In addition, innovative products, quality, service, utility, cost and technical support are the primary competitive factors in the separation and filtration membrane industry. Some of our competitors are much larger companies that have greater financial, technological, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Many of these competitors are also better established as suppliers to the markets that we serve. As a result, a reduction in overall demand or increased costs to design and produce our products within these markets could cause us to reduce our prices, which could lower our profit margins and impair our ability to grow our business.\nWe must continue to invest significant resources in developing innovative products in order to maintain a competitive edge in the highly specialized markets in which we operate.\nOur continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain our technological capabilities and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize innovative products for the separation and filtration membrane industry. For example, products for some consumer electronics applications have a short lifecycle and require constant development. If we fail to continue to develop products for those\nmarkets or keep pace with technological developments by our competitors generally, we may lose market share which could result in reduced sales and impair our financial condition.\nThe loss of large volume customers could impact our sales and our profits.\nOur products are often sold to a relatively small number of large volume customers. For example, in fiscal 2014, sales to our top five customers represented approximately 27% of our total net sales. The loss of any large volume customer could impact our sales and our profits.\nVertical integration by our customers of the production of our products into their own manufacturing processes could reduce our sales and our profits.\nOur future sales and profits will depend to a significant extent upon whether our customers choose in the future to manufacture the separation and filtration membranes used in their products instead of purchasing these components from us. If any of our existing customers choose to vertically integrate the production of our products in such a manner, the loss of sales to these customers could reduce our sales and our profits.\nIncreases in prices for raw materials or the loss of key supplier contracts could reduce our profit margins.\nThe primary raw materials we use in the manufacture of most of our products are polyethylene and polypropylene resins, silica and oil. In fiscal 2014, raw materials accounted for approximately 34% of our cost of sales. Although our major customer contracts generally allow us to pass increased costs on to our customers, we may not be able to pass on all raw material price increases to our customers in each case or without delay. The loss of any of our key suppliers could disrupt our business until we secure alternative supply arrangements. Furthermore, any new supply agreement we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply arrangements.\nOur substantial indebtedness could harm our ability to react to changes in our business or to market developments and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of January 3, 2015, our consolidated indebtedness was $487.5 million. Our cash interest requirements for the next twelve months are estimated to be $12.9 million. Our substantial level of indebtedness, as well as any additional borrowings we may make under the unused portions of our senior secured credit agreement, increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial debt could increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility to plan for, or to react to, changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate. This limitation could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt and more cash to insulate their operations from market downturns and to finance new business opportunities.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nAt January 3, 2015, we had variable rate debt of $487.5 million. An interest rate increase would result in an increase in interest expense. Our earnings may not be sufficient to allow us to meet any such increases in interest rate expense and to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell more securities, none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do on terms favorable to the Company or at all. We may, from time to time, enter into certain derivative instruments (or hedging agreements), in order to reduce our exposure to cash flow variability that may arise from interest rate volatility. No hedging activity can\ncompletely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates, and hedging agreements could also fix our interest rates above the market rates. As of January 3, 2015, we had an interest rate swap agreement to economically convert a portion of our LIBOR-based, variable rate debt into fixed rate debt. See Note 8, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,\" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. However, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations for a variety of reasons, including those mentioned elsewhere in this \"Risk Factors\" section. Without sufficient cash flow, future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior secured credit agreement in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity or capital needs. If we cannot generate sufficient cash to service our debt, we will have to take such actions as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our senior secured credit agreement may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives.\nThe terms of our senior secured credit agreement may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to market changes or to take certain actions.\nOur senior secured credit agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. For example, our senior secured credit agreement includes covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees, engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, or amend or otherwise alter terms of our indebtedness and other material agreements. Our senior secured credit agreement also includes financial covenants requiring that we maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.\nA breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with financial covenants could result in a default under our senior secured credit agreement. If any such default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings and to proceed against all collateral granted to them to secure the debt. If collateral (such as available cash) is repossessed by the lenders, we will be unable to access the capital and other resources necessary to operate our business, and we could incur immediate and significant losses.\nSome of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. Any employee slowdowns, strikes or failure to renew our collective bargaining agreements could disrupt our business.\nApproximately 34% of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. A majority of those employees are located in France and Germany and are represented under industry-wide agreements that are subject to national and local government regulations. Many of these collective bargaining agreements must be renewed annually. Labor unions also represent our employees in Owensboro, Kentucky, and Corydon, Indiana.\nLabor organizing activities could result in additional employees becoming unionized. We may not be able to maintain constructive relationships with these labor unions or successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements in the future. The loss of a substantial number of these employees or\na prolonged labor dispute could disrupt our business. Any such disruption could in turn reduce our sales, increase our costs to bring products to market and result in significant losses.\nWe generate most of our sales from manufacturing products that are used in a wide variety of industries and the potential for product liability exposure for our products could be significant.\nWe manufacture a wide variety of products that are used in healthcare and consumer applications. Several of these products are used in medical devices that some consumers require in order to sustain their lives. As a result, we may face exposure to product liability claims in the event that the failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or death. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to make warranty payments or to participate in a recall involving those products. Consequently, end users of our products may look to us for contribution when faced with product recalls, product liability or warranty claims. The future costs associated with defending product liability claims or providing product warranties could be material and we may experience material losses in the future as a result. A successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in any product recall could substantially reduce our available cash from operations. Reduced cash could in turn reduce our profits or impair our financial condition.\nOur operations outside the United States pose risks to our business that are not present with our domestic business, including compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws.\nOur manufacturing facilities in the United States accounted for 37% of total net sales for fiscal 2014, with facilities in Europe and Asia accounting for 40% and 23%, respectively. Typically, we sell our products in the currency of the country where the manufacturing facility that produced the products is located. In addition, as part of our growth and acquisition strategy, we may expand our operations in these or other foreign countries. Our foreign operations are, and any future foreign operations will be, subject to certain risks that are unique to doing business in foreign countries. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, economic or political instability, shipping delays, changes in applicable laws and regulatory policies and inconsistent enforcement of such laws and policies and various trade restrictions. All of these risks could have a negative impact on our ability to deliver products to customers on a competitive and timely basis. This could reduce or impair our sales, profits, cash flows and financial position. The future imposition of, or significant increases in the level of, customs duties, import quotas or other trade restrictions could also increase our costs and reduce our profits.\nCountries around the world are increasingly enacting anti-corruption laws, many of which are patterned after the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"). The FCPA generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from giving, or offering to give, anything of value to foreign officials with the intent of obtaining an improper business advantage. The FCPA's foreign counterparts contain similar prohibitions, although varying in both scope and jurisdiction. Our internal policies prohibit corruption in all forms and expressly mandate compliance with the FCPA in particular. Despite such policies and the FCPA training we provide to our employees, we cannot guarantee that our employees', agents' or other intermediaries' conduct will not periodically violate the anti-corruption laws of a particular nation. Our continued overseas expansion, especially in the aforementioned emerging markets, naturally increases the risk of such violations and consequently could cause a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.\nWe could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental laws, and violations of such laws may increase our costs or require us to change certain business practices.\nWe use and generate a variety of chemicals and other hazardous by-products in our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign\nenvironmental laws and regulations. These environmental laws govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the handling, storage and release of waste and hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations can be complex and change often. We regularly incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, and such costs could increase significantly with changes in legal requirements or their interpretation or enforcement. Some of our manufacturing facilities have been the subject of actions to enforce environmental requirements. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and third-party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations of environmental laws. Failure to comply with environmental requirements could also result in enforcement actions that materially limit or otherwise affect the operations of the facilities involved.\nUnder certain environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of an environmentally contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property. This liability could result whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous materials.\nContaminants have been detected at some of our present facilities, principally in connection with historical operations. Investigations and/or clean-ups of these contaminants have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites. The costs of investigating and remediating environmental conditions at some of our facilities may be substantial. If our remediation costs are higher than expected, our exposure to these costs would increase. This exposure could reduce our cash available for operations, consume valuable management time and reduce our profits or impair our financial condition.\nWe anticipate additional investigations and clean-ups of on-site contamination under regulatory supervision or voluntarily at some of our sites. In addition, the imposition of more stringent clean-up requirements, the discovery of additional contaminants or the discovery of off-site contamination at or from one or more of our facilities could result in significant additional costs to us.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we could lose a significant competitive advantage.\nOur success with our products depends, in part, on our ability to protect our unique technologies and products against competitive pressure and to defend our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours.\nEven though we have filed patent applications, we may not be granted patents for those applications. Our failure to secure these patents may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover. Moreover, even if we are granted a patent, that does not prove conclusively that the patent is valid and enforceable. Our existing or future patents that we receive or license may not provide competitive advantages for our products. Our competitors may invalidate, narrow or avoid the scope of any existing or future patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights that we receive or license. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products. Patent rights are territorial; thus, the patent protection we do have will only extend to those countries in which we have issued patents. Even so, the laws of certain countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and various European countries. The loss of protection for our intellectual property could reduce the market value of our products, reduce product sales and lower our profits or impair our financial condition.\nWe intend to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously, and from time to time we may initiate claims against third parties that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation or we may be required to participate in other administrative proceedings. Lawsuits brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property\nrights could be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously harm our business.\nSecurity interests or liens have been granted to financial institutions on some of our patents. If we fail to satisfy our obligations, the financial institutions have rights to those patents.\nDue to the unique products that we produce and the particular industry in which we operate, the loss of our senior management could disrupt our business.\nOur senior management is important to the success of our business. There is significant competition for executive personnel with unique experience in the separation and filtration membrane industry. As a result of this unique need and the competition for a limited pool of industry-based executive experience, we may not be able to retain our existing senior management. In addition, we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract additional senior management personnel. All of our executive officers are free to pursue other business opportunities (other than our chief executive officer, who is bound by a non-compete provision of his employment agreement), including those that may compete with us. The loss of any member of our senior management without retaining a suitable replacement (either from inside or outside our existing management team) could disrupt our business.\nWe may pursue future acquisitions. If we incur contingent liabilities and expenses or additional debt in connection with future acquisitions or if we cannot effectively integrate newly acquired operations, our business could be disrupted.\nAcquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect. Future acquisitions would likely result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities. Such acquisitions could also increase our interest and amortization expenses as well as periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Acquisitions could also result in significant charges relating to integration costs. We may not be able to integrate successfully any business we acquire into our existing business. Any acquired businesses may not be profitable or as profitable as we had expected. The successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. The successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business. This could decrease the time that they have to service and attract customers and develop new products and services. In addition, because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, complications and delays. Such expenses and delays could include difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight. Our inability to complete the integration of new businesses in a timely and orderly manner could increase costs, reduce our profits and ultimately disrupt our business.\nAs part of our lithium battery capacity expansions, we have purchased a significant amount of property, plant and equipment, which may be subject to impairment if lithium market demand does not materialize as anticipated.\nSince late 2009, we have invested over $300.0 million in capacity expansions for our electronics and EDVs segment. Demand for lithium battery separators has been lower than originally anticipated, and we are currently operating our production facilities at levels below full capacity. If demand for lithium battery separators does not materialize as expected, we may have to recognize an impairment charge to such assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, adverse market conditions, the loss of customers, significant changes in the expected adoption rate of EDVs and adverse changes in laws or regulations. Any future determination\nrequiring the impairment of long-lived assets would reduce our profits for the fiscal period in which the write-off occurs.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets, which may never generate the returns we expect.\nOur net identifiable intangible assets at January 3, 2015 were approximately 6% of our total assets. Such assets include customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, license agreements and technology acquired in acquisitions. Goodwill, which relates to the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired, was approximately 32% of our total assets at January 3, 2015. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of the acquired business, adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations. We may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. Any future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of intangible assets would reduce our profits for the fiscal period in which the write-off occurs.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural disasters, epidemics, terrorist acts and other events beyond our control, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations may be subject to significant interruption if any of our facilities are damaged or destroyed. For example, certain of our products are manufactured at a single facility location for which we do not maintain a backup manufacturing facility. A natural or other disaster, such as a fire or flood, could significantly disrupt our operations, delay or prevent product manufacture and shipment for the time required to repair, rebuild or replace our manufacturing facilities, which could be lengthy, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities. In addition, concerns about terrorism or an outbreak of epidemic diseases, especially in our major markets of North America, Europe and Asia could have a negative effect on travel and our business operations, and result in adverse consequences on our sales and financial performance.\nCyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers. Security breaches and other failures of this infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns and unauthorized disclosure of confidential and/or proprietary information. If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to such failures and breaches, our operations could be disrupted and we may suffer reputational, financial or other damage that has a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 92132, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "PPO"}
