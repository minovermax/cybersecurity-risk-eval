RISK FACTORS\nRisks to Our Industry\nOur business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions in the United States and abroad.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending that affect not only the ultimate consumer, but also small businesses and other retailers. Specialty retail, and retail in general, is heavily influenced by general economic cycles. Purchases of non-essential, discretionary products tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income declines. During periods of economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales to existing customers, make sales to new customers, open and operate new stores, maintain sales levels at our existing stores, maintain or increase our international operations on a profitable basis, maintain our earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales, or generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operational and liquidity needs. The United States and global economies have suffered from economic uncertainty for the past several years, and there continues to be global concern that we may be entering into another recessionary period. While consumer spending in the United States has stabilized recently, it could deteriorate in the future. As a result, our operating results may be adversely and materially affected by downward trends or uncertainty in the United States or global economies.\nIncreases in the price of leather and other items we sell or a reduction in availability of those products could increase our cost of goods and decrease our profitability.\nThe prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for leather, metals, and other products. The cost of these items may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, supply conditions, transportation costs, government regulation, economic climates, political considerations, and other unpredictable factors. Leather prices world-wide have been on the rise for the past several years and the outlook for future prices is uncertain. Increases in these costs, together with other factors, will make it difficult for us to sustain the gross margin level we have achieved in recent years and result in a decrease in our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers or reduce costs in other areas. Accordingly, such increases in costs could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nFurther, involvement by the United States in war and other military operations in the Middle East and other areas abroad could disrupt international trade and affect our inventory sources. Finally, livestock diseases such as mad cow could reduce the availability of hides and leathers or increase their cost. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may be unable to sustain our past growth or manage our future growth, which may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\nWe have experienced modest sales and earnings growth recently. Many specialty retailers have experienced periods of growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses. Our business may be similarly affected in the future. We anticipate that our future growth will depend on a number of factors, including consumer preferences, the strength and protection of our brand, the market success of our current and future products, the success of our growth strategies, and our ability to manage our future growth. Further, our future success will depend substantially on the ability of our management team to manage our growth effectively, optimizing our operational, administrative, financial, and legal procedures in order to maximize profitability. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our future operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.\nOur industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including fluctuations in the cost of the leathers and metal products that we purchase and changes in consumer spending patterns and acceptance of our products. Changes in consumers\u2019 product preferences or lack of acceptance of our products whose costs have increased may prohibit us from passing those increases on to customers which could cause our gross margin to decline. If our product costs increase and our sale prices do not, our future operating results could be adversely affected unless we are able to offset such gross margin declines with comparable reductions in operating costs.\nWe may be unsuccessful in implementing our planned international expansion, which could impair the value of our brand, harm our business and negatively affect our results of operation.\nWe plan to grow our net sales and net earnings from our International Leathercraft segment by opening stores in various international markets. As we expand outside of North America, we may incur significant costs relating to starting up, maintaining, and expanding foreign operations. Such costs may include, but are not limited to, obtaining locations for stores, hiring personnel, and travel expenses. We may be unable to open and operate new stores successfully and as a result, our growth may be limited, unless we are able to identify desirable sites for store locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, hire, train, and retain competent store personnel; manage inventory effectively to meet the needs and demands of customers on a timely basis, manage foreign currency risk effectively, and achieve acceptable operating margins from the new stores. We may not successfully open new stores or our new stores may not be profitable. If we are unable to successfully open new stores or our new stores are not profitable, our business and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs we continue to increase our international operations, we face the possibility of greater losses from a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors which are beyond our control, such as political instability or acts of terrorism, which disrupt trade with the countries in which our suppliers or customers are located; local business practices that do not conform to legal or ethical guidelines; restrictions or regulations relating to imports or exports; additional or increased customs duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges on imports; significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies; social, legal or economic instability in the foreign markets in which we do business, which could influence our ability to sell our products in these markets; and restrictions on the transfer of funds between the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the opening of additional stores in North America or we may be unable to obtain sufficient new locations on acceptable terms to meet our growth plans. Further, we may fail to hire and train qualified managers to oversee the stores opened.\nOur strategy to grow our business partially depends on continuing to successfully open new stores in North America. The success of this strategy will depend largely upon our ability to find a sufficient number of suitable locations and our ability to recruit, hire, and train qualified personnel to operate our new stores.\nOur long-term expansion plans in North America call for us to open new stores both in new geographic areas and in or near the areas where we have existing stores. To the extent that we open stores in markets where we already have existing stores, we may experience reduced net sales at those existing stores. Also, if we expand into new geographic areas, those stores may not be received as well as, or achieve net sales or profitability levels comparable to those of, our existing stores in our estimated time periods, or at all. If our stores fail to achieve, or are unable to sustain, acceptable net sales and profitability levels, our business may be materially harmed and we may incur costs associated with closing or relocating stores. In addition, our current expansion plans are only estimates, and the actual number of stores we open each year and in total and the actual number of suitable locations for our new stores could differ significantly from these estimates. If we are unable to successfully open new stores or our new stores are not profitable, our business and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on the continued protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights.\nOur trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and competitive position, and the loss of or inability to enforce our trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights could harm our business. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis. Despite any precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property, policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, expensive, and time consuming, and we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property or determine the extent of any unauthorized use. Our efforts to establish and protect our trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation or counterfeiting of our products by others, which may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name. Further, we could incur substantial costs in legal actions relating to our use of intellectual property or the use of our intellectual property by others. Even if we are successful in these actions, the costs we incur could have a material adverse effect on us.\nForeign currency fluctuations could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generally purchase our products in U.S. dollars. However, we source a large portion of our products from countries other than the United States. The cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the applicable currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international business will sell products. Furthermore, the majority of our international sales are generally derived from sales in foreign countries. This revenue, when translated into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes, could be materially affected by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, negatively impacting our results of operations and our ability to generate revenue growth.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to maintain our brand image.\nTandy Leather is one of the most recognized brand names in our industry. Our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of that brand. If we are unable to provide quality products and exceptional customer service to our customers, including education, which Tandy Leather has traditionally been known for, our brand name may be impaired which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOther uncertainties, which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, may occur as well and may adversely affect our business and our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79666, "SIC": 5990, "TIC": "TLFA"}
