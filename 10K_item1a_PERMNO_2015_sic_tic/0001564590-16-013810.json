The risks described below may not be the only risks which potentially could impact our business. These additional risks include those which are unknown at this time or that are currently considered immaterial. If any of the circumstances, events, or developments described below actually occur to a significant degree, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows could be adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nA prolonged downturn in economic conditions, especially in Daytona Beach, Florida, could adversely impact our business. In recent years, the collapse of the housing market, together with the crisis in the credit markets, resulted in a recession in the local and national economy with significant levels of unemployment, shrinking gross domestic product, and drastically reduced consumer spending. During this period, potential consumers of residential real estate often deferred or avoided real estate purchases due to, among other factors, a lack of liquidity, the substantial costs involved, and overall uncertainty with the economy. The real estate industry is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions which are outside of our control, such as short and long-term interest rates, housing demand, population growth, and unemployment levels and job growth. Our real estate operations segment is especially sensitive to economic conditions in Florida, particularly in Daytona Beach, where substantially all of our land portfolio is located. While Florida has experienced improving economic conditions the recovery for Florida started later and has taken longer than the rest of the nation. A prolonged period of economic weakness or another downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nWe may experience a decline in the fair value of our real estate assets or investments which could result in impairments and would impact our financial condition and results of operations. A decline in the fair market value of our long-lived assets may require us to recognize an \u201cother-than-temporary\u201d impairment against such assets (as defined by FASB authoritative accounting guidance) if certain conditions or circumstances related to an asset were to change and we were to determine that, with respect to any such asset, there was an unrealized loss to the fair value of the asset. The fair value of our long-lived assets depends on market conditions, including estimates of future demand for these assets, and the revenues that can be generated from such applicable assets including land or an income property. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize the estimated unrealized losses through earnings and write down the depreciated or amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sales price received and the adjusted depreciated or amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale.\nThe most recent downturn in the U.S. economy and real estate markets caused the fair value of certain of our properties to decrease. In 2011, we wrote down the carrying value of our golf operations assets and certain of our land assets with corresponding non-cash charges against our earnings to reflect the impaired value. In 2013, we wrote down the carrying value of a small parcel of land reacquired through foreclosure in 2009 when a portion of this reacquired land was under contract to be sold for a price that was less than the carrying value of the land. If the real estate market were to experience another decline, we may be required to take other impairment charges against our earnings for other than temporary impairments in the value of our real estate assets including our land, income properties, commercial loan investments and similar financings or other capitalized costs. Any such non-cash charges could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS (continued)\nOur quarterly results are subject to variability. We have historically derived a substantial portion of our income from transactions in our land holdings. The timing of such real estate transactions is not predictable and is generally subject to the purchaser\u2019s ability to, among other things, obtain on a timely basis acceptable financing and approvals from local municipalities and regulatory agencies for the intended use of the land. As these approvals are subject to third party responses, it is not uncommon for delays to occur, which affect the timing of transaction closings and may also impact the terms and conditions of the transaction. These timing issues have caused, and may continue to cause, our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nOur future success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to successfully execute our strategy to invest in income- producing assets. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to execute our strategy of investing in income-producing assets, including income properties and commercial loans or similar financings secured by real estate. There is no assurance that the income property portfolio will expand at all, or if it expands, at any specified rate or to any specified size. If we continue to invest in diverse geographic markets other than the markets in which we currently own properties, we will be subject to risks associated with investing in new markets as those markets will be relatively unfamiliar to us. In addition, investments in new markets may introduce increased costs to us relating to factors including the regulatory environment and the local and state tax structure. Additionally there is no assurance we will or can expand our investments in commercial loans or similar financings secured by real estate. Consequently if we are unable to acquire additional income-producing assets or our investments in new markets introduce increased costs our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for the acquisition of income properties and more established competitors may be able to compete more effectively for acquisition opportunities than we can. A number of entities compete with us to purchase income properties. We compete with REITs, public and private real estate focused companies, high wealth individual investors, and others. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Several of our public company competitors have greater access to raising equity or debt financing, have significant amounts of capital available and objectives that overlap with ours, which may create competition for acquisition opportunities. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of income property acquisitions and establish more relationships than us. We cannot be assured that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and therefore our cash flows. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and purchase assets that are consistent with our objectives.\nIf we are not successful in utilizing the like-kind exchange structure in deploying the proceeds from our land transactions or dispositions of non-core income properties, or our like-kind exchange transactions are disqualified, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Our strategy of investing in income-producing properties includes the utilization, when possible, of proceeds obtained from the disposition of non-core income properties or from land transactions, which qualify for deferral of the applicable income tax through the like-kind exchange provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to complete a qualifying acquisition utilizing the aforementioned proceeds, or a transaction we deemed qualifying for like-kind exchange treatment is subsequently disqualified by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be subject to increased income taxes, which may adversely impact our results of operations and our cash flows.\nWe are subject to a number of risks inherent with the real estate industry and in the ownership of real estate assets or investment in financings secured by real estate which may adversely affect our returns from our investments, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Factors beyond our control can affect the performance and value of our real estate assets including our land, income properties, investments in commercial loans or similar financings secured by real estate or other investments. Real estate assets are subject to various risks, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\nAdverse changes in national, regional, and local economic and market conditions where our properties are located;\n\u00b7\nCompetition from other real estate companies similar to ours and competition for tenants, including competition based on rental rates, age and location of the property and the quality of maintenance, insurance, and management services;\n\u00b7\nChanges in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants or decreases in market rental rates;\n\u00b7\nZoning or other local regulatory restrictions, or other factors pertaining to the local government institutions which inhibit interest in the markets in which our land holdings or income producing assets are located;\n\u00b7\nCosts associated with the need to periodically repair, renovate or re-lease our properties;\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS (continued)\n\u00b7\nIncreases in the cost of our operations, particularly maintenance, insurance, or real estate taxes which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in our revenues;\n\u00b7\nChanges in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies, and ordinances;\n\u00b7\nIlliquidity of real estate investments which may limit our ability to modify our income producing asset portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions;\n\u00b7\nActs of God, including natural disasters, which may result in uninsured losses; and\n\u00b7\nActs of war or terrorism, including consequences of terrorist attacks.\nIf any of these or similar events occurs, it may reduce our return from an affected real estate asset or investment which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of revenues from our income property portfolio or certain tenants would adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. While no single tenant represents more than 10% of our consolidated revenues as of December 31, 2015, we have tenants who lease a number of our income properties or a large amount of the square footage of our income property portfolio, such as Wells Fargo, Lowe\u2019s Corporation, Bank of America, Big Lots and Hilton Resorts Corporation. The default, financial distress, or bankruptcy of one or all of these tenants could cause substantial vacancies in our income property portfolio and reduce our revenues from our income property operations significantly thereby adversely impacting our results of operations and cash flows. Vacancies reduce our revenue until the affected properties can be re-leased and could decrease the value of each such vacant property. Upon the expiration of the leases that are currently in place, we may not be able to re-lease a vacant property at a comparable lease rate or without incurring additional expenditures in connection with such re-leasing. If, following the loss of an income property tenant, we are unable to re-lease the income property at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s leases may be unenforceable. The Company\u2019s rights and obligations with respect to its leases are governed by written agreements with its tenants. A court could determine that one or more provisions of such an agreement are unenforceable, such as a particular remedy, a termination provision, or a provision governing the Company\u2019s remedies for default of the tenant lessee. If we were unable to enforce provisions of a lease agreement or agreements, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to dispose of properties we target for sale to recycle our capital. While the Company\u2019s strategy may include selectively selling non-core income-producing properties to recycle our capital, we may be unable to sell properties targeted for disposition due to adverse market conditions or not achieve the pricing or timing that is consistent with our expectations. This may adversely affect, among other things, the Company\u2019s ability to deploy capital into the acquisition of other income-producing properties, the execution of our overall operating strategy and consequently our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMost of our land holdings are located in a Daytona Beach, Florida and the competition in the local and regional market, the possible impact of government regulation or development limitations, and the criteria used by interested parties interested in acquiring land could adversely impact interest in our land and thereby our results of operations and cash flows. The parties typically interested in our land holdings base their decision to acquire land on, among other things, price, location, and land use or optionality of land use. In some instances the aforementioned acquisition criteria or other factors may make an interested party consider other land holdings instead of ours. In addition, parties interested in acquiring our land holdings would likely consider the impact of governmental regulations or ordinances on their ability to develop the land for their intended use and may seek incentives or similar economic considerations from the governmental authorities that they may not be able to obtain. These conditions may make it difficult for us to complete land transactions on acceptable terms or at all which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s real estate investments, including our land holdings and income-producing assets, are generally illiquid. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, therefore, it may be difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises and otherwise the Company\u2019s ability to make rapid adjustments in the size and content of our income property portfolio or other real estate assets in response to economic or other conditions is limited. Illiquid assets typically experience greater price volatility, as a ready market does not exist, and can be more difficult to value. In addition, validating third party pricing for illiquid assets may be more subjective than more liquid assets. As a result, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of certain of our real estate assets or income producing asset portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS (continued)\nassets. Further, certain expenditures necessary to operate our income property operations, real estate operations and golf operations generally do not get reduced and may in fact increase in response to weakening economic conditions or other market disruptions including maintenance costs, insurance costs, and in some instances, interest expense. This relationship of revenue and expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced operating results and cash flows and thereby could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nContinued or increased operating losses from the golf operations may adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. The Company has golf operations consisting of two 18-hole golf courses in Daytona Beach, Florida, with a food and beverage operation, and club membership operations. A third party manages and staffs these operations on behalf of the Company. Since its inception the golf operation has generated negative cash flows. In 2011, the Company recognized an impairment of approximately $4.0 million on the long-lived assets of the golf operations. The results of operations from the golf operations are subject to the typical execution risks inherent with many golf, retail and club operations including, but not limited to: maintenance, merchandising, pricing, customer service, competition, consumer preferences and behavior, safety, compliance with various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, environmental contamination, weather conditions, or other trends in the local market. Although the negative cash flows generated by the golf operations decreased substantially in 2014 and 2015, any one of these execution risk factors could negatively impact the golf operations and thereby adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition, seasonality and market conditions relating to golf operations could adversely affect our operating results. Our golf operations face competition from similar golf operations in the surrounding areas. Any new competition from golf operations that are developed close to our existing golf operations also may adversely impact the results of our golf operations. Our golf operations are also subject to changes in market conditions, such as population trends and changing demographics, any of which could adversely affect results of operations. In addition, our golf operations may suffer if the economy weakens, if the popularity of golf decreases, or if unusual weather conditions or other factors cause a reduction in rounds played. Our golf operations are seasonal, primarily due to the impact of the winter tourist season and Florida\u2019s summer heat and rain. Should any of these factors impact our golf operations unfavorably our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be impacted adversely.\nThe revenues from our golf operations depend on a third-party operator that we do not control. We currently utilize a third-party to manage and operate our golf operations. As a result, we do not directly implement operating business decisions with respect to the operation and marketing of our golf operations, and personnel decisions. For our golf operations these decisions may concern course maintenance, membership programs, marketing programs, and employee matters. The amount of revenue that we generate from the golf operations is dependent on the ability of the third-party manager to maintain and increase the gross receipts from LPGA International. If the revenues from our golf operations decline or the operating expenses increase at a rate that is inconsistent with revenues our results of operations and our cash flows would be adversely affected.\nOur investment strategy may involve credit risk. As part of our business strategy, we have invested in commercial loans secured by commercial real estate and may invest in other commercial loans or similar financings secured by real estate in the future. Investments in commercial loans or similar financings of real estate involve credit risk with regard to the borrower, the borrower\u2019s operations and the real estate that secures the financing. The credit risks include, but are not limited to, the ability of the borrower to execute their business plan and strategy, the ability of the borrower to sustain and/or improve the operating results generated by the collateral property, the ability of the borrower to continue as a going concern, and the risk associated with the market or industry in which the collateral property operates. Our evaluation of the investment opportunity in a mortgage loan or similar financing includes these elements of credit risk as well as other underwriting criteria and factors. Further, we may rely on third party resources to assist us in our investment process and otherwise conducting customary due diligence. Our underwriting of the investment or our estimates of credit risk may not prove to be accurate, as actual results may vary from our estimates. In the event we underestimate the performance of the borrower and/or the underlying real estate which secures our commercial loan or financing, we may experience losses or unanticipated costs regarding our investment and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nBecause of competition, we may not be able to acquire commercial loans or similar financings at all or at favorable yields. We may not be able to execute our strategy of acquiring commercial loans or similar financings at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. We compete with many other investment groups including REITs, public and private investment funds, life insurance companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies, including some of the third parties with which we expect to have relationships. In most instances the competition has greater financial capacity, larger organizations and operating presence in the market. As a result, we may not be able to acquire commercial loans or similar financings in the future at all or at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows and would likely result in the need for any growth in our portfolio of income-producing assets to be achieved through the acquisition of income properties.\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS (continued)\nDebt and preferred equity investments could cause us to incur expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We currently own, or may own in the future, investments in first mortgages, mezzanine loans, junior participations and preferred equity interests. Such investments may or may not be recourse obligations of the borrower and are not insured or guaranteed by governmental agencies or otherwise. In the event of a default under these obligations, we may have to take possession of the collateral securing these interests including through foreclosure proceedings. Borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or our other remedies, and may seek bankruptcy protection to potentially block our actions to enforce their obligations to us. Relatively high loan-to-value ratios and declines in the value of the underlying collateral property may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our investment upon foreclosure or realization even if we make substantial improvements or repairs to the underlying real estate in order to maximize such property\u2019s investment potential.\nAs appropriate, we will maintain and regularly evaluate financial reserves to properly accrue for potential future losses. Our reserves would reflect management\u2019s judgment of the probability and severity of losses and the value of the underlying collateral. We cannot be certain that our judgment will prove to be correct and that our reserves, if any, will be adequate over time to protect against future losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific properties, assets, tenants, borrowers, industries in which our tenants and borrowers operate or markets in which our tenants and borrowers, or their properties are located. If we are unable to enforce our contractual rights, including but not limited to, taking possession of the collateral property in a foreclosure circumstance, or our reserves for credit losses prove inadequate, we could suffer losses which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe mezzanine loan assets that we expect to acquire will involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. We may acquire mezzanine loans, which generally take the form of subordinated loans secured by the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. These types of assets involve a higher degree of risk than senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. In the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or the debt that is senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will only be satisfied after the senior debt has been satisfied. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our initial investment. In addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. Significant losses related to our mezzanine loans would result in operating losses for us and could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may invest in fixed-rate loan investments, and an increase in interest rates may adversely affect the value of these investments, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increases in interest rates may negatively affect the market value of our investments, particularly any fixed-rate commercial loans or other financings we have invested in. Generally any fixed-rate commercial loans or other financings will be more negatively affected by rising interest rates than adjustable-rate assets. We are required to reduce the book value of our investments by the amount of any decrease in their fair value. Reductions in the fair value of our investments could decrease the amounts we may borrow to purchase additional commercial loan or similar financing investments, which could impact our ability to increase our operating results and cash flows. Furthermore, if our borrowing costs are rising while our interest income is fixed for the fixed-rate investments, the spread between our borrowing costs and the fixed-rate we earn on the commercial loans or similar financing investments will contract or could become negative which would adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe commercial loans or similar financings we expect to acquire that are secured by commercial real estate typically depend on the ability of the property owner to generate income from operating the property. Failure to do so may result in delinquency and/or foreclosure. Commercial loans are secured by commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure and therefore the risk of loss. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. In the event of any default under a commercial loan held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the commercial loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In the event of the bankruptcy of a commercial loan borrower, the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law. Foreclosure of a loan can be an expensive and lengthy process, which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed commercial loan. If the borrower is unable to repay a mortgage loan or similar financing our inability to foreclose on the asset in a timely manner,\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS (continued)\nand/or our inability to obtain value from reselling or otherwise disposing of the asset for an amount equal to our investment basis would adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe activities or actions of a third party servicer engaged to service our investment in a commercial loan or similar debt financing could adversely impact the value of our investment or our results of operations and cash flows. Our investments in first mortgages, mezzanine loans or other debt financings secured by real estate may require a third party servicer to service the loan on our behalf and/or on behalf of third parties who have invested in some portion of the debt financing. An intended or unintended breach by the servicer with regard to their servicing of the debt financing or in their contractual obligations and fiduciary duties to us or the other holders of the debt financing could adversely impact the value of our investment or our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may suffer losses when a borrower defaults on a loan and the underlying collateral value is less than the amount due. If a borrower defaults on a non-recourse loan, we will only have recourse to the real estate-related assets collateralizing the loan. If the underlying collateral value is less than the loan amount, we will suffer a loss. Conversely, some of our commercial loans may be unsecured or are secured only by equity interests in the borrowing entities. These loans are subject to the risk that other lenders in the capital stack may be directly secured by the real estate assets of the borrower or may otherwise have a superior right to repayment. Upon a default, those collateralized lenders would have priority over us with respect to the proceeds of a sale of the underlying real estate. In cases described above, we may lack control over the underlying asset collateralizing our loan or the underlying assets of the borrower before a default, and, as a result, the value of the collateral may be reduced by acts or omissions by owners or managers of the assets. In addition, the value of the underlying real estate may be adversely affected by some or all of the risks referenced above with respect to our owned real estate.\nSome of our commercial loans may be backed by individual or corporate guarantees from borrowers or their affiliates which are not secured. If the guarantees are not fully or partially secured, we typically rely on financial covenants from borrowers and guarantors which are designed to require the borrower or guarantor to maintain certain levels of creditworthiness. Where we do not have recourse to specific collateral pledged to satisfy such guarantees or recourse loans, we will only have recourse as an unsecured creditor to the general assets of the borrower or guarantor, some or all of which may be pledged as collateral for other lenders. There can be no assurance that a borrower or guarantor will comply with its financial covenants, or that sufficient assets will be available to pay amounts owed to us under our loans and guarantees. As a result of these factors, we may suffer additional losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nUpon a borrower bankruptcy, we may not have full recourse to the assets of the borrower to satisfy our loan. Additionally, in some instances, our loans may be subordinate to other debt of certain borrowers. If a borrower defaults on our loan or on debt senior to our loan, or a borrower files for bankruptcy, our loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt receives payment. Where debt senior to our loan exists, the presence of inter-creditor arrangements may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loans, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies (through \u201cstandstill\u201d periods), and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings. Bankruptcy and borrower litigation can significantly increase collection costs and the time needed for us to acquire title to the underlying collateral (if applicable), during which time the collateral and/or a borrower\u2019s financial condition may decline in value, causing us to suffer additional losses.\nIf the value of collateral underlying a loan declines, or interest rates increase during the term of a loan, a borrower may not be able to obtain the necessary funds to repay our loan at maturity through refinancing because the underlying property revenue cannot satisfy the debt service coverage requirements necessary to obtain new financing. If a borrower is unable to repay our loan at maturity, we could suffer additional loss which may adversely impact our financial performance.\nAs a result of any of the above factors or events, the losses we may suffer could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInvestments in securities of companies operating in the real estate industry, including debt and equity instruments such as corporate bonds; preferred or common stock; or convertible instruments could cause us to incur losses or other expenses which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We currently own, or may own in the future, investments in corporate securities of companies operating in the real estate industry including debt and equity instruments such as corporate bonds; preferred or common stock; or convertible instruments. Certain of these investments are traded on an exchange or other active market whereby the price of the underlying instrument is quoted daily and those quoted prices and thus the market value of the instrument varies during a given trading day. Certain of these investments are traded on an exchange or market that is not deemed an active market but where the price of the investment fluctuates daily or otherwise. Adverse fluctuations in the value of these investments, whether market generated or not, are reflected as unrealized losses on our balance sheet. We may choose to or be required to liquidate these investments in whole or in part and at prices that result in realized losses on our investment. Should we incur realized losses on liquidating these investments our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS (continued)\nThe Company may be unable to obtain debt or equity capital on favorable terms, if at all, or additional borrowings may impact our liquidity. We may seek to obtain additional debt financing or raise equity capital and may be unable to do so on favorable terms, if at all, to further our business objectives. We may obtain unsecured debt financing in addition to our credit facility which could decrease our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. Capital that may be available may be materially more expensive or available under terms that are materially more restrictive than the Company\u2019s existing debt capital, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAn increase in our borrowing costs would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. While we have no short-term maturities in our long-term debt, should we seek to utilize additional debt to help finance our acquisitions, increased interest rates would reduce the difference, or spread, that we may earn between the yield on the investments we make and the cost of the leverage we employ to finance such investments. It is possible that the spread on investments could be reduced to a point at which the profitability from investments would be significantly reduced or eliminated entirely. This would adversely affect our returns on our assets, our financial condition, our results of operations, and cash flows and could require us to liquidate certain or all of these assets.\nThe Company\u2019s revolving credit facility and secured financings include certain financial and/or other covenants that could restrict its operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default that accelerates the required payment of such debt. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $38.3 million of outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and $60.4 million of secured debt. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants which include, among others, a maximum total indebtedness and limits on the repurchase of the Company\u2019s stock and similar restrictions. In addition, the revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenants pertaining to debt service coverage ratios, maximum levels of investment in certain types of assets, the number and make-up of the properties in the borrowing base and similar covenants typical for this type of indebtedness. The Company\u2019s secured indebtedness generally contains covenants regarding debt service coverage ratios. The Company\u2019s ability to meet or maintain compliance with these and other debt covenants may be dependent on the performance by the Company\u2019s tenants under their leases. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with certain of its debt covenants could result in a default that may, if not cured, accelerate the payment under such debt and limit the Company\u2019s available cash flow for acquisitions, dividends, or operating costs, which would likely have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, these defaults could impair the Company\u2019s access to the debt and equity markets.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, to pay any cash due upon conversion of or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future operating and financial performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nCertain investors in the convertible debt issuance may also invest in our common stock utilizing trading strategies which may increase the volatility in or adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our common stock. Investors in, and potential purchasers of, the Notes may employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Notes. Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to our convertible debt instruments typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the Notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the Notes. Investors may also implement this strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of or in addition to short selling our common stock. These strategies, particularly the effect short sales or equity swaps with respect to our common stock, could increase the volatility of our stock price or otherwise adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe continue to have the ability to incur debt; if we incur substantial additional debt, the higher levels of debt may affect our ability to pay the interest and principal of our debt. Despite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future (subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments), some of which may be secured debt. The indenture governing our Notes does not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured, or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. If we incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, these higher levels of indebtedness may affect our ability to pay the principal of, and interest on, our outstanding debt and our creditworthiness generally.\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS (continued)\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes or purchase the Notes as required upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon a purchase or conversion of the Notes. Following certain potential events qualifying as a fundamental change under the Indenture governing the Notes, including a change of control, holders of Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Notes for cash. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or a prepayment event under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing indebtedness. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. There is no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price or make cash payments upon conversion. In addition, restrictions in our then existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to purchase the Notes upon a fundamental change or make cash payments upon conversion. Our failure to purchase the Notes upon a fundamental change or make cash payments upon conversion thereof when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nTo the extent we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy all or a portion of the settlement of our Notes, conversions of the Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes into common stock. To the extent we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation pursuant to the Notes, the conversion of some or all of the Notes into common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe fundamental change purchase feature of our Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company. The terms of the Notes require us to offer to purchase the Notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture agreement of the Notes. A non-stock takeover of our company may trigger the requirement that we purchase the Notes. This feature may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert their Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for our Notes, which may be settled in cash, may have a material effect on our reported financial results. Under Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of shareholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income (or greater net loss) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock.\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS (continued)\nConvertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method if we have the ability and intent to settle in cash, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to demonstrate the ability or intent to settle in cash or that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nDeclines in value of the assets in which we invest will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and make it more costly to finance these assets. Generally, we use our income property investments as collateral for our financings or as the borrowing base for our credit facility. Any decline in their value, or perceived market uncertainty about their value, could make it difficult for us to obtain or renew financing on favorable terms or at all, or maintain our compliance with terms of any financing arrangements already in place.\nOur operations could be negatively impacted by the loss of key management personnel. We believe our future success depends, to a significant extent, on the efforts of each member of the Company\u2019s senior management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel. The loss of, or our inability to replace, any member of senior management could adversely affect our operations and our ability to execute our business strategies and thereby our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We maintain key man insurance on our Chief Executive Officer, but we do not have key man life insurance policies on the other members of our senior management.\nThe Company has a single shareholder who holds more than 26% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock and related voting rights and the significance of its investment could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our stock, and business operations. A single institutional shareholder of the Company owns more than 26% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and the voting rights affiliated with those shares. Based on the reported size of this shareholder\u2019s assets under management in their investment fund, their ownership in the Company\u2019s common stock has become an increasingly significant component of their fund. With regard to the significance of this shareholder\u2019s investment in the Company as a percentage of its total investment fund, certain securities limitations imposed on its fund with regard to ownership levels in our stock may require this shareholder to liquidate some amount of the shares it owns in the Company, which could have an adverse impact on our stock price. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company received communications from this shareholder, and this shareholder has made public filings which have led or could lead to the Company having to incur certain costs for legal representation, accounting services, or other third party costs to address the claims, allegations or other matters contained in its communications. Such costs, while not reasonably estimable, may represent significant costs for the Company which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations and properties could be adversely affected in the event of a hurricane, earthquake, natural disaster, or other significant disruption. Our corporate headquarters and many of our properties are located in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred. We have income properties in southern California where earthquakes have occurred. Depending on where any particular hurricane makes landfall, our properties in Florida could experience significant damage. Similarly, should an earthquake occur in southern California, our properties there could incur significant damage. In addition, the occurrence and frequency of hurricanes in Florida could also negatively impact demand for our real estate assets because of consumer perceptions of hurricane risks. In addition to hurricanes, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, fires, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop properties or realize income from our properties. If a hurricane, earthquake, natural disaster or other similar significant disruption occurs, we may experience disruptions to our operations and damage to our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, our financing condition, our results of operations, and our cash flows.\nUninsured losses may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to pay outstanding indebtedness. The Company\u2019s income-producing properties are generally covered by comprehensive liability, fire, and extended insurance coverage, typically paid by the tenant under the triple-net and double-net lease structure. The Company believes that the insurance carried on its properties is adequate and in accordance with industry standards. There are, however, types of losses (such as from hurricanes, earthquakes, or other types of natural disasters or wars or other acts of violence) which may be uninsurable or the cost of insuring against these losses\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS (continued)\nmay not be economically justifiable. If an uninsured loss occurs or a loss exceeds policy limits, the Company could lose both its invested capital and anticipated revenues from the property, thereby reducing the Company\u2019s cash flow, impairing the value of the income property and adversely impacting the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nActs of violence, terrorist attacks or war may affect the markets in which the Company operates and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may negatively affect the Company\u2019s operations. There can be no assurance that there will not be terrorist attacks against businesses within the United States. These attacks may directly impact the Company\u2019s physical assets or business operations or the financial condition of its tenants, lenders or other institutions with which the Company has a relationship. The United States may be engaged in armed conflict, which could have an impact on these parties. The consequences of armed conflict are unpredictable, and the Company may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on its business. More generally, the occurrence of any of these events or the threat of these events, could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economies. They also could result in, or cause a deepening of, the economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are highly dependent on information systems and certain third-party technology service providers, and systems failures not related to cyber-attacks or similar external attacks could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of our systems or our networks could cause delays or other problems in our operations and communications. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems. In addition, much of our information technology infrastructure is or may be managed or run by third parties and as such we also face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints by any of these third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities. It is difficult to determine what, if any, negative impact may directly result from any specific interruption or disruption of our networks or systems or any failure to maintain performance, reliability and security of our technical infrastructure but significant events impacting our systems or networks could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and disrupt operations. Cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, disrupted operations, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. Should any such cyber incidents or similar events occur, the Company\u2019s assets, particularly cash could be lost and the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business and strategy, thereby, its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nLand use and environmental regulations could restrict, make more costly, or otherwise adversely impact our business. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to land use, and development and permitting and environmental compliance obligations. Any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of significant financial penalties or restrictions on our operations that could adversely affect present and future operations or our ability to sell land, and thereby, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Municipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer. Additionally, development moratoriums may be imposed due to among other possibilities an over capacity of traffic on roads. In some areas, municipalities may enact growth control initiatives, which will restrict the number of building permits available in a given year. If municipalities in which we own land take actions such as those outlined, acquirers of our land assets may experience delays, increasing costs, or limitations in the ability to operate in those municipalities, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may encounter environmental problems which require remediation or the incurrence of significant costs to resolve which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate or that we owned or operated in our history, and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances or incur costs or obligations associated with wetland areas on our land holdings. Any such liability may be imposed without regard to whether we knew about the origination of the environmental or wetland issues or were responsible for their occurrence. The presence of environmental issues or the failure to remediate properly any such losses at any of our properties or on our land holdings may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or, to borrow using those properties as collateral.\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS (continued)\nThe costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. The costs or liabilities associated with resolving environmental or wetland issues could be significant.\nThe uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the property-specific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties. In general, before we acquire our income properties, independent environmental consultants are engaged to conduct Phase I environmental assessments, which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling. Based on the Phase I results, we may conduct Phase II environmental assessments which do involve this type of sampling. There can be no assurance that environmental liabilities have not developed since these environmental assessments were prepared or that future uses or conditions (including changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations) or new information about previously unidentified historical conditions will not result in the imposition of environmental liabilities.\nIf we are subject to any material costs or liabilities associated with environmental or wetland issues our financial condition, results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, all public accommodations and commercial facilities must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons, compliance with which may be costly. Compliance with the ADA requirements could involve modifications to our income properties or golf operations. Other federal, state and local laws may require modifications to or restrict further renovations of our income properties or golf operations. Although we believe that our income properties and golf operation facilities are sufficiently in compliance with present requirements, noncompliance with the ADA or related laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines by the United States Government or in the award to private litigants of damages against us. Costs such as these, as well as the general costs of compliance with these laws or regulations, may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCompliance with proposed and recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations increases our costs. The Dodd-Frank Act contains many regulatory changes and calls for future rulemaking that may affect our business. The final and complete set of regulations promulgating the Dodd-Frank Act has not yet been published. We are evaluating, and will continue to evaluate the potential impact of regulatory change under the Dodd-Frank Act and other changes in securities laws and regulations.\nThe market value of the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility. As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock depends on various factors, which may change from time-to-time and/or may be unrelated to the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows and such factors may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. These factors include, but are likely not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic and financial market conditions including a weak economic environment;\n\u00b7\nLevel and trend of interest rates;\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets to raise additional debt or equity capital;\n\u00b7\nChanges in the Company\u2019s cash flows or results of operations;\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and performance;\n\u00b7\nMarket perception of the Company compared to other real estate companies;\n\u00b7\nMarket perception of the real estate sector compared to other investment sectors; and\n\u00b7\nVolume of average daily trading and the amount of the Company\u2019s shares available to be traded.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, and share price. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) as amended or modified from time to time, requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not be able to ensure that it can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective internal control over financial reporting and therefore would likely not be in compliance with SOX. An effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for the Company to prepare and produce reliable financial reports and to maintain its qualification as a public company and are important in helping to prevent financial fraud. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its business and operating results could be harmed, qualification as a public company listed on the New York Stock\nITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS (continued)\nExchange MKT, or the NYSE MKT, could be jeopardized, investors could lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information, and the market price of the Company\u2019s shares could drop significantly.\nThe termination of the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan requires final regulatory compliance which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows. As of December 31, 2014 the Company had terminated its defined benefit pension plan with an effective date of the termination of March 31, 2014. The process for finalizing the termination of the pension plan includes compliance with regulatory review by the IRS.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to many factors. The Company has consistently paid a dividend since 1976. The Company\u2019s ability to continue to pay dividends may be adversely impacted if any of the risks described in this section were to occur. Payment of the Company\u2019s dividend depends upon the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 26650, "SIC": 6510, "TIC": "CTO"}
