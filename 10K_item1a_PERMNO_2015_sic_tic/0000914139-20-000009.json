{"cik": "914139", "company": "PARKERVISION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.\n\ufeff\nOur financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\ufeff\nWe have had significant losses and negative cash flows in every year since inception, and continue to have an accumulated deficit which, at December 31, 2019, was approximately $401.8 million. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $9.5 million and $20.9 million, respectively. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included in their audit opinion on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, a statement with respect to substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 includes a discussion regarding our liquidity and our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern may adversely affect our ability to negotiate reasonable terms with our vendors and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nWe have had a history of losses which may ultimately compromise our ability to implement our business plan and continue in operation.\n\ufeff\nTo date, our technologies and products have not produced revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs. We will continue to make expenditures on patent protection and enforcement and general operations in order to continue our current patent enforcement efforts. Those efforts may not produce a successful financial outcome in 2020, or at all. Without a successful financial outcome from one or more of our patent enforcement efforts, we will not achieve profitability. Furthermore, our current capital resources are not sufficient to sustain our operations through 2020. If we are not able to generate sufficient revenues or obtain sufficient capital resources, we will not be able to implement our business plan or meet our current obligations due within the twelve months after the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements and investors will suffer a loss in their investment. This may also result in a change in our business strategies.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to fund our operations. Failure to raise such additional capital may prevent us from implementing our business plan as currently formulated.\n\ufeff\nBecause we have had net losses and, to date, have not generated positive cash flow from operations, we have funded our operating losses primarily from the sale of debt and equity securities, including our secured contingent debt obligation. Our capital resources include cash and cash equivalents of $0.06 million at December 31, 2019 and proceeds of approximately $2.1 million received during the first quarter of 2020 from various debt and equity transactions. Although we implemented significant cost reduction measures in 2018 and 2019, our business plan will continue to require expenditures for patent protection and enforcement and general operations. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we used $3.4 million and $10.3 million, respectively in cash for operations which was funded primarily through the sale of convertible debt and equity securities. Our current capital resources will not be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the twelve months after the issuance of our consolidated\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfinancial statements and we will require additional capital to fund our operations. Additional capital may be in the form of debt securities, the sale of equity securities, including common or preferred stock, additional litigation funding, or a combination thereof. Failure to raise additional capital will have a material adverse impact on our ability to achieve our business objectives.\n\ufeff\nRaising additional capital by issuing debt securities or additional equity securities may result in dilution and/or impose covenants or restrictions that create operational limitations or other obligations.\n\ufeff\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations and meet our current obligations due within the twelve months after the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements. Financing, if any, may be in the form of debt or sales of equity securities, including common or preferred stock. Debt instruments or the sale of preferred stock may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations, any of which may be burdensome to us and may have a material adverse impact on our ability to implement our business plan as currently formulated. The sale of equity securities, including common or preferred stock, may result in dilution to the current stockholders\u2019 ownership and may be limited by the number of shares we have authorized and available for issuance.\n\ufeff\nWe may be obligated to repay outstanding notes at a premium upon the occurrence of an event of default.\n\ufeff\nWe have $2.3 million in secured and unsecured notes payable and $3.6 million in outstanding principal under convertible notes payable at December 31, 2019 and we have an additional $0.5 million in outstanding principal under convertible notes issued in the first quarter of 2020. If we fail to comply with the various covenants set forth in each of the notes, including failure to pay principal or interest when due or, under certain notes, consummating a change in control, we could be in default thereunder. Upon an event of default under each of the notes, the interest rate of the notes will increase to 12% per annum and the outstanding principal balance of the notes plus all accrued unpaid interest may be declared immediately payable by the holders. We may not have sufficient available funds to repay the notes upon an event of default, and we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to obtain other financing at terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur ability to utilize our tax benefits could be substantially limited if we fail to generate sufficient income or if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d\n\ufeff\nWe have cumulative net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) totaling approximately $335.1 million at December 31, 2019, of which $314.8 million is subject to expiration in varying amounts from 2020 to 2037. Our ability to fully recognize the benefits from those NOLs is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient income prior to their expiration. In addition, our NOL carryforwards may be limited if we experience an ownership change as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d). In general, an ownership change under Section 382 occurs if 5% shareholders increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of our outstanding shares by more than 50 percentage points over a relevant lookback period. The sale of additional equity securities may trigger an ownership change under Section 382 which will significantly limit our ability to utilize our tax benefits. In order to avoid limitations imposed by Section 382, we may be limited in the amount of additional equity securities we are able to sell to raise capital.\n\ufeff\nOur litigation funding arrangements may impair our ability to obtain future financing and/or generate sufficient cash flows to support our future operations.\n\ufeff\nWe have funded much of our cost of litigation through contingent financing arrangements with Brickell and contingent fee arrangements with legal counsel. The repayment obligation to Brickell is secured by the majority of our assets until such time that we have repaid a specified minimum return. Furthermore, our contingent arrangements will result in reductions in the amount of net proceeds retained by us from\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nlitigation, licensing and other patent-related activities. The contingent fees payable to others could exceed half of our future proceeds depending on size and timing of proceeds, among other factors. The long-term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon our ability to secure sufficient financing to support our business, and our ability to generate revenues and/or patent related proceeds sufficient to offset expenses and meet our contingent payment obligation. Failure to generate revenue or other patent-related proceeds sufficient to repay our contingent obligation may impede our ability to obtain additional financing which will have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our long-term business objectives.\n\ufeff\nOur litigation can be time-consuming, costly and we cannot anticipate the results.\n\ufeff\nSince 2011, we have spent a significant amount of our financial and management resources to pursue patent infringement litigation against third parties. We believe this litigation, and other litigation matters that we may in the future determine to pursue, will continue to consume management and financial resources for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that our current or future litigation matters will ultimately result in a favorable outcome for us or that our financial resources will not be exhausted before achieving a favorable outcome. In addition, even if we obtain favorable interim rulings or verdicts in particular litigation matters, they may not be predictive of the ultimate resolution of the matter. Unfavorable outcomes could result in exhaustion of our financial resources and could hinder our ability to pursue licensing and/or product opportunities for our technologies in the future. Failure to achieve favorable outcomes from one or more of our patent enforcement actions will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and business prospects. We have contingent fee arrangements in place with others to reduce our litigation related expenditures; however any litigation-based or other patent-related amounts collected by us will be subject to contingency payments to our legal counsel and other funding parties which will reduce the amount retained by us.\n\ufeff\nIf our patents and intellectual property rights do not provide us with the anticipated market protections, our competitive position, business, and prospects will be impaired.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on our intellectual property rights, including patents and patent applications, to provide competitive advantage and protect us from theft of our intellectual property. We believe that our patents are for entirely new technologies and that our patents are valid, enforceable and valuable. However, third parties have made claims of invalidity with respect to certain of our patents and other similar claims may be brought in the future. For example, the Federal Patent Court in Munich recently invalidated one of our patents that was the subject of infringement cases against LG and Apple in Germany following a nullity claim filed by Qualcomm. If our patents are shown not to be as broad as currently believed, or are otherwise challenged such that some or all of the protection is lost, we will suffer adverse effects from the loss of competitive advantage and our ability to offer unique products and technologies. As a result, there would be an adverse impact on our financial condition and business prospects. Furthermore, defending against challenges to our patents may give rise to material costs for defense and divert resources away from our other activities.\n\ufeff\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\n\ufeff\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility and uncertainty in financial markets. If such volatility and uncertainty persist, we may be unable to raise additional capital on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Additionally, in response to the pandemic, governments and the private sector have taken a number of drastic measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. While our employees currently have the ability and are encouraged to work remotely, such measures may have a substantial impact on employee attendance or productivity, which, along with the possibility of employees\u2019 illness, may adversely affect our operations.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, COVID-19 is expected to negatively impact the timing of our current patent infringement actions as a result of office closures, travel restrictions and court closures. For example, each of our patent infringement cases in Florida have motions pending or granted for the extension of certain court deadlines due to the impact of COVID-19.\n\ufeff\nAlthough COVID-19 is currently not material to our results of operations, there is significant uncertainty relating to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our ongoing patent enforcement actions and our ability to obtain financing, as well as our results of operations and financial condition, generally, will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by governments and private businesses to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 continue for an extensive period of time, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to outside influences beyond our control, including new legislation that could adversely affect our licensing and enforcement activities and have an adverse impact on the execution of our business plan.\n\ufeff\nOur licensing and enforcement activities are subject to numerous risks from outside influences, including new legislation, regulations and rules related to obtaining or enforcing patents. For instance, the U.S. has enacted sweeping changes to the U.S. patent system including changes that transition the U.S. from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and that alter the processes for challenging issued patents. To the extent that we are unable to secure patent protection for our future technologies and/or our current patents are challenged such that some or all of our protection is lost, we will suffer adverse effects to our ability to offer unique products and technologies. As a result, there would be an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to execute our business plan.\n\ufeff\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological changes which if we are unable to match or surpass, will result in a loss of competitive advantage and market opportunity.\n\ufeff\nBecause of the rapid technological development that regularly occurs in the wireless technology industry, along with shifting user needs and the introduction of competing products and services, we have historically devoted substantial resources to developing and improving our technology and introducing new product offerings. As a result of our limited financial resources, we have ceased our research and development activities which could result in a loss of future market opportunity which could adversely affect our future revenue potential.\n\ufeff\nWe are highly dependent on Mr. Jeffrey Parker as our chief executive officer. If his services were lost, it would have an adverse impact on the execution of our business plan.\n\ufeff\nBecause of Mr. Parker\u2019s leadership position in the company, the relationships he has garnered in both the industry in which we operate and the investment community, and the key role he plays in our patent litigation strategies, the loss of his services might be seen as an impediment to the execution of our business plan. If Mr. Parker was no longer available to the company, investors might experience an adverse impact on their investment. We maintain $5 million in key-employee life insurance for our benefit for Mr. Parker.\n\ufeff\nIf we are unable to retain key executives and other highly skilled employees, we will not be able to execute our current business plans.\n\ufeff\nOur business is dependent on having skilled and specialized key executives and other employees to conduct our business activities. The inability to retain these key executives and other specialized employees would have an adverse impact on the technical support activities and the financial reporting\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nand regulatory compliance activities that our business requires. These activities are instrumental to the successful execution of our business plan.\n\ufeff\nAny disruptions to our information technology systems or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations, compromise our reputation, and expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions, and costly response measures and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on information technology systems, including third-party hosted servers and cloud-based servers, to keep business, financial, and corporate records, communicate internally and externally, and operate other critical functions. If any of our internal systems or the systems of our third-party providers are compromised due to computer virus, unauthorized access, malware, and the like, then sensitive documents could be exposed or deleted, and our ability to conduct business could be impaired. Cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to our systems, computer viruses or other malicious code, denial of service attacks, malware, ransomware, phishing, SQL injection attacks, human error, or other events that result in security breaches or give rise to the manipulation or loss of sensitive information or assets. Cyber incidents can be caused by various persons or groups, including disgruntled employees and vendors, activists, organized crime groups, and state-sponsored and individual hackers. Cyber incidents can also be caused or aggravated by natural events, such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, and telecommunications failures. The risk of cybersecurity breach has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks from around the world has increased. While we have cyber security procedures in place, given the evolving nature of these threats, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses in the future due to cyber-attacks.\n\ufeff\nTo date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks, computer viruses or other systems failures. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber-attacks. In addition to operational and business consequences, if our cybersecurity is breached, we could be held liable to our customers or other parties in regulatory or other actions, and we may be exposed to reputation damages and loss of trust and business. This could result in costly investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties, fines and negative publicity.\n\ufeff\nOur outstanding options and warrants may affect the market price and liquidity of the common stock.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2019, we had 34.1 million shares of common stock outstanding and had outstanding options and warrants for the purchase of up to 23.6 million additional shares of common stock, of which approximately 15.6 million were exercisable as of December 31, 2019. In addition, as described more fully below, holders of convertible notes may elect to receive a substantial number of shares of common stock upon conversion of the notes and we may elect to pay accrued interest on the notes in shares of our common stock. All of the shares of common stock underlying these securities are or will be registered for sale to the holder or for public resale by the holder. The amount of common stock reserved for issuance may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and may affect the price and liquidity of our common stock in the public market. In addition, the issuance of these shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on current stockholders\u2019 ownership.\n\ufeff\nThe conversion of outstanding convertible notes into shares of common stock, and the issuance of common stock by us as payment of accrued interest upon the convertible notes, could materially dilute our current stockholders.\n\ufeff\nWe have aggregate principal of $3.6 million in convertible notes outstanding at December 31, 2019. The notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at fixed conversion prices, which may be less than\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe market price of our common stock at the time of conversion. If the entire principal is converted into shares of common stock, we would be required to issue an aggregate of up to 20.8 million shares of common stock. In addition, in the first quarter of 2020, we issued an additional aggregate principal amount of $0.5 million in convertible notes which, if converted at the fixed conversion price, would result in the issuance of an additional 3.5 million shares of our common stock. If we issue all of these shares, the ownership of our current stockholders will be diluted.\n\ufeff\nFurther, we may elect to pay interest on the notes, at our option, in shares of common stock, at a price equal to the then-market price for our common stock. To date, we have issued approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock as in-kind interest payments on our convertible notes. We currently do not believe that we will have the financial ability to make payments on the notes in cash when due. Accordingly, we currently intend to make such payments in shares of our common stock to the greatest extent possible. Such interest payments could further dilute our current stockholders.\n\ufeff\nThe price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility.\n\ufeff\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019, the reported high and low sales prices for our common stock ranged between $0.06 and $1.25 per share. The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, developments in outstanding litigation, our performance and prospects, general conditions of the markets in which we compete, and economic and financial conditions, and the impact of COVID-19 on global financial markets. Such volatility could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in future periods.\n\ufeff\nOur common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market and is now quoted on OTCQB, an over-the-counter market. There can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to trade on the OTCQB or on another over-the-counter market or securities exchange.\n\ufeff\nTrading of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on August 17, 2018 as a result of our failure to maintain at least $35 million in market value of listed securities. Our common stock began trading on the OTCQB, an over-the-counter market, immediately following delisting from Nasdaq, under the symbol \u201cPRKR\u201d. The over-the-counter market is a significantly more limited market than Nasdaq, and the quotation of our common stock on the over-the-counter market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market generally have less liquidity due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all. We may be subject to additional compliance requirements under applicable state laws relating to the issuance of our securities. This could have a long-term adverse effect on our ability to raise capital, which ultimately could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. We cannot provide any assurances as to if or when we will be in a position to relist our common stock on a nationally-recognized securities exchange.\n\ufeff\nOur common stock is classified as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC rules, which means broker-dealers who make a market in our stock will be subject to additional compliance requirements.\n\ufeff\nOur common stock is deemed to be a \"penny stock\" as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Penny stocks are stocks (i) with a price of less than five dollars per share; (ii) that are not traded on a recognized national exchange; (iii) whose prices are not quoted on an automated quotation system sponsored by a recognized national securities association; or (iv) whose issuer has net\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntangible assets less than $2,000,000 (if the issuer has been in continuous operation for at least three years); or $5,000,000 (if continuous operations for less than three years); or with average revenues of less than $6,000,000 for the last three years. The Exchange Act requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor\u2019s account. Potential investors in our common stock are urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Further, the Exchange Act requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. These procedures require the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his, her or its financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor, and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\n\ufeff\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and thus stockholders must look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments.\n\ufeff\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and intend to retain our cash and future earnings, if any, to fund our business plan. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements. We therefore cannot offer any assurance that our board of directors will determine to pay special or regular dividends in the future. Accordingly, unless our board of directors determines to pay dividends, stockholders will be required to look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. There can be no assurance that this appreciation will occur.\n\ufeff\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could have effects that conflict with the interest of shareholders.\n\ufeff\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes with directors having staggered terms of office, our board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval, and there are advance notification provisions for director nominations and submissions of proposals from shareholders to a vote by all the shareholders under the by-laws. Florida law also has anti-takeover provisions in its corporate statute.\n\ufeff\nWe have a shareholder protection rights plan that may delay or discourage someone from making an offer to purchase the company without prior consultation with the board of directors and management, which may conflict with the interests of some of the shareholders.\n\ufeff\nOn November 17, 2005, as amended on November 20, 2015, our board of directors adopted a shareholder protection rights plan which called for the issuance, on November 29, 2005, as a dividend, of rights to acquire fractional shares of preferred stock. The rights are attached to the shares of common stock and transfer with them. In the future the rights may become exchangeable for shares of preferred stock with various provisions that may discourage a takeover bid. Additionally, the rights have what are known as \u201cflip-in\u201d and \u201cflip-over\u201d provisions that could make any acquisition of the company more costly. The principal objective of the plan is to cause someone interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe board of directors rather than launch an unsolicited bid. This plan may limit, prevent, or discourage a takeover offer that some shareholders may find more advantageous than a negotiated transaction. A negotiated transaction may not be in the best interests of the shareholders.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 80019, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "PRKR"}
