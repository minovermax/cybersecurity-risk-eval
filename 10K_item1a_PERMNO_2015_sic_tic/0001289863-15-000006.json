Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, limiting the ability to evaluate historical financial results and increasing the likelihood that our results will fall below investors\u2019 expectations, which could cause the price of our shares to drop.\nIn 2014 our net revenues and operating loss from continuing operations fluctuated quarterly, primarily due to decreased revenues from our accounting/finance division. Revenues were affected by a decrease in usage of certain courses in our library, as well as from our Loscalzo subsidiary and EEI division, both of which are in the live continuing education business. We anticipate lower revenues in future periods from live training, as EEI has reduced the number of course offerings, that are described more fully below. EEI\u2019s revenue is primarily recognized in the second and fourth quarters of the year and Loscalzo has virtually no revenue in the first quarter. In both cases we expense payroll and other costs as incurred regardless of when the revenue is recognized. As a result, our operating results were significantly better in the fourth quarter than each of the prior three quarters in 2014. These quarterly fluctuations can also cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions and other factors.\nOur customer base consists primarily of corporations, professionals and professional services firms and other businesses whose employees are required to take continuing education on a periodic basis as well as individual professionals. During economic downturns, some of our clients attempt to do without education and training as a cost-saving measure and others seek a less costly provider of the type of services we offer. They may also curtail the demand for customized products and the number of users may diminish as a result of reduced staff. In addition to budgetary constraints caused by economic conditions, attendance at live seminars can be affected by other factors such as weather or travel restrictions.\nOur \"Back to Basics\" plan may not produce the results that we expect which could impair our results of operations.\nIn June 2014, we commenced our \"Back to Basics\" plan that entailed reducing staffing in certain areas, closing, selling or reducing certain verticals of our business and re-purposing our resources to those areas of the business that provide the greatest return. In conjunction with this plan, in 2014 we sold substantially all of the assets of our Skye Multimedia Ltd. (Skye) subsidiary and discontinued our custom ethics business. Also, we plan on reducing the number of live events managed by EEI and have reduced overhead related to development. The discontinued operations of Skye are reflected separately in our operating results.\nWe do not expect to realize the full benefit of our \u201cBack to Basics\u201d plan until 2015. We anticipate that our annualized cost savings from net personnel reductions will be substantial and have a positive effect on our net income. We estimate that, exclusive of possible reductions in revenues and/or increases in related costs, our operating costs will be reduced by approximately $750,000 per annum. We are hopeful that an increase in sales personnel and in marketing efforts from re-purposing our resources to those areas of the business that provide the greatest return will offset any declines in revenue and/or increases in related costs. We must caution that our operating results can be greatly affected by many factors as our \"Back to Basics\" plan is implemented. If our cost savings is not sufficient to offset the reductions in revenues and/or increases in related costs, our results of operations will be negatively impacted.\nOur subscription-based business depends on new business and customers renewals. Any decline in renewals or inability to obtain new subscriptions could affect future earnings.\nA substantial portion of our net revenues is derived from subscriptions. Although, we have a high renewal rate, the loss of a substantial amount of renewals in any of our products, could have a material negative impact on our future results of operations. In addition, the inability to obtain new subscriptions or sell additional products to our existing customers could have a material negative impact on our business.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets.\nWe are required to test goodwill and our other intangible assets for impairment at least annually or if a triggering event occurs in accordance with the provisions of Topic ASC 350 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Such impairment could be\ncaused by any number of factors, including significant negative industry trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business or lack of growth in the areas covered by these intangibles could result in a charge to earnings for impairment of any of our intangible assets or goodwill. Any such charge could have a material impact on our earnings and our stock price. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely, heavily, on projections of future operating results, which may or may not be achieved.\nImplementation or change in existing accounting regulations could have an impact on our operating results.\nWhile we believe that we are in compliance with existing accounting standards and regulations, adoption of new accounting standards that may be promulgated in the future by the applicable rule making bodies could have a material negative impact on our future results of operations and earnings.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. Increased competition could result in margin erosion and loss of market share and brand recognition.\nOur competitors include professional firms, public and privately held companies, universities (traditional and online), other live educational companies and professional and not-for-profit organizations and associations. Many of our existing and potential competitors have greater financial resources, larger market share, broader and more varied libraries, technology and delivery systems that are more flexible or cost-effective, stronger alliances, and/or lower cost structures than we do - which may enable them to establish a stronger competitive position than we have, in part through greater marketing opportunities, such as offering free CPE. If we fail to address competitive developments quickly and effectively, we will not be able to grow.\nIn addition, the consolidation or acquisition of our competitors could change the environment in which we operate as they may achieve greater market share, improved technology and greater resources.\nOur current growth strategy assumes that we will not be able to make targeted strategic acquisitions.\nA key feature of our prior growth strategy was to make strategic acquisitions. We recently have not been able to consummate additional strategic acquisitions in order to achieve our expected rate of growth. However, we will still pursue viable potential acquisitions that are presented to us. As part of our Back to Basics plan we are now concentrating on internal, organic growth.\nAn acquisition strategy is inherently risky. Some of the risks we may face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u2022\nidentifying appropriate targets in an efficient and timely fashion;\n\u2022\nnegotiating terms that we believe are reasonable;\n\u2022\ncompetition from larger companies and venture capital and private equity firms for acquisition targets;\n\u2022\nfailing to accurately assess the true cost of entering new markets or marketing new products;\n\u2022\nintegrating the operations, technologies, products, personnel and customers of the acquired enterprise;\n\u2022\nmaintaining our focus on our existing business;\n\u2022\nlosing key employees; and\n\u2022\nreducing earnings because of disproportionately large depreciation and amortization deductions relating to the acquired assets.\nWe may not be able to identify any appropriate targets or acquire them on reasonable terms. Even if we make strategic acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these businesses into our existing operations in a cost-effective and efficient manner. In addition, we may not achieve the benefits that we anticipated when we made these acquisitions, causing a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to keep up with changes affecting the markets that we serve, we will become less competitive, adversely affecting our financial performance.\nIn order to remain competitive and serve our customers effectively, we must respond on a timely and cost-efficient basis to changes in technology, industry standards and procedures and customer preferences. We need to continuously develop new course material that addresses new developments, laws, regulations, rules, standards, guidelines, releases and other pronouncements that are periodically issued by legislatures, government agencies, courts, professional associations and other regulatory bodies. In some cases these changes may be significant and the cost to comply with these changes may be substantial. We cannot assure that we will be able to adapt to any changes in the future or that we will have the financial resources to keep up with changes in the marketplace. Also, the cost of adapting our products and services may have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur future growth and competitiveness depends on our ability to adapt to new technologies and changes to existing technologies and new applications to meet market demand.\nOne of our principal competitive advantages is our ability to deliver content in multiple formats. For example, in addition to the traditional classroom setting, we offer a broad spectrum of internet based training solutions as our courses are available online and we can deliver webinars. This flexibility has enabled us to keep pace with changes in technology and has contributed to our growth. Keeping pace with technological developments can be difficult and expensive, adversely impacting our operating results. However, our continued growth depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to our customers\u2019 needs and preferences. If we fail to do that, the potential adverse impact could be significant to our business, operating results and financial condition. We cannot assure that we will be able to keep pace and adapt to changes in technology or customer preferences.\nOur future success depends on retaining our existing key employees and hiring and assimilating new key employees. The loss of key employees or the inability to attract new key employees could limit our ability to execute our growth strategy, resulting in lost sales and a slower rate of growth.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to retain our key employees including our chief executive officer, Allen S. Greene, our president, Jack Fingerhut and our chief technology officer and executive vice-president, Joseph Fish. Mr. Greene is an experienced senior corporate executive who has been instrumental in cutting costs, negotiating and consummating the acquisitions that have helped us focus on our core competencies while at the same time expand into new markets. Mr. Fingerhut is one of our founders and is actively involved in sales and marketing and identifying acquisition targets. Mr. Fingerhut also has overall responsibility for the accounting products. He has extensive contacts within - and knowledge of - the accounting profession. Mr. Fish has been instrumental in developing and introducing our new technology products such as our AMS and LMS. Although we have employment agreements with all of these executives, each executive can terminate his agreement at any time. Also, we do not carry, nor do we anticipate obtaining, \u201ckey man\u201d insurance on these individuals. It would be difficult for us to replace any one of these individuals should they resign or become incapacitated. In addition, as we grow we may need to hire additional key personnel. We may not be able to identify and attract high quality employees or successfully assimilate new employees into our existing management structure. In addition, if any of our division heads were to leave, it could affect our revenues adversely.\nOur sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, which could delay our growth and make it difficult for us to predict earnings. This could lead to stock price volatility.\nOur sales cycle is unpredictable and depends on various factors including the type and size of the customer and the nature of the product being sold. Generally, sales to larger entities and sales of custom-designed products take longer to close. Most of our revenue is derived from corporate customers. Identifying the decision maker in these enterprises is often time consuming. Other variables in the purchasing process include the timing of disbursement of funds and the person-to-person sales contact process. Sales may take much longer than anticipated, may fall outside the approved budget cycle and, therefore, may not occur due to the loss of funding. This unpredictability has in the past caused, and may in the future cause, our net revenue and financial results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nOur strategic relationships are usually, non-exclusive arrangements and our strategic partners may provide the same or similar services to our competitors, diluting any competitive advantage we get from these relationships.\nWe rely on our strategic partners to provide us with access to content and to sell our content. Our strategic partners may enter, and some have entered, into identical or similar relationships with our competitors, which could diminish the value of our products. Our relationships with our strategic partners are primarily covered by annual agreements that are subject to renewal. While we do not depend on any single strategic relationship for a significant amount of revenue or to develop content, if a number of these organizations were to terminate their relationships with us at the same time, our ability to develop new content on a timely basis and our ability to distribute content would be impaired. We may not be able to maintain our existing relationships or enter into new strategic relationships.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately or cost effectively, which may cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices.\nOur success depends in part on our brand identity and our ability to protect and preserve our proprietary rights. We cannot assure that we will be able to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property rights and technology without our authorization. We do not own any patents on our technology. Rather, to protect our intellectual property, we rely on trade secrets, common law trademark rights, trademark registrations, copyright notices, copyright registrations, as well as confidentiality, work for hire, development, assignment and license agreements with our employees, consultants, third-party developers, licensees and customers. However, these measures afford only limited protection and may be flawed or inadequate.\nAlso, enforcing our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and could distract management\u2019s attention from operating business matters.", "PERMNO": 90447, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "SPRO.1"}
