{"cik": "1057060", "company": "MARINEMAX INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nCompetition and Industry Conditions Risk Factors\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the well-being, as well as the continued popularity and reputation for quality of the boating products, of our manufacturers, particularly Brunswick\u2019s Sea Ray and Boston Whaler boat lines and Azimut-Benetti Group\u2019s Azimut products. The failure to obtain a high quality and desirable mix of competitively priced products that our customers demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nApproximately 33% of our revenue in fiscal 2020 resulted from sales of new boats manufactured by Brunswick, including approximately 15% from Brunswick\u2019s Sea Ray division, 16% from Brunswick\u2019s Boston Whaler division, and approximately 2% from Brunswick\u2019s other divisions. Additionally, approximately 9% of our revenue in fiscal 2020 resulted from sales of new boats manufactured by Azimut-Benetti Group. The remainder of our fiscal 2020 revenue from new boat sales resulted from sales of products from a limited number of other manufacturers, none of which accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.\nWe depend on our manufacturers to provide us with products that compare favorably with competing products in terms of quality, performance, safety, and advanced features, including the latest advances in propulsion and navigation systems. Any adverse change in the production efficiency, product development efforts, technological advancement, expansion of manufacturing footprint, supply chain and third-party suppliers, marketplace acceptance, marketing capabilities, ability to secure adequate access to capital, and financial condition of our manufacturers, particularly Brunswick including Mercury Marine a division of Brunswick, and Azimut-Benetti Group given our reliance on Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, Mercury Marine engines, and Azimut, would have a substantial adverse impact on our business. Any difficulties encountered by any of our manufacturers, particularly Brunswick and Azimut-Benetti Group, resulting from economic, financial, or other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect the quality and amount of products that they are able to supply to us and the services and support they provide to us.\nAny interruption or discontinuance of the operations of Brunswick, Azimut-Benetti Group or other manufacturers, as experienced in June 2018 with Brunswick discontinuing its Sea Ray sport yacht and yacht models, could cause us to experience shortfalls, disruptions or delays with respect to needed inventory. Although we believe in our brand, our product diversification and that adequate alternate sources would be available that could replace any manufacturer other than Brunswick and Azimut-Benetti Group as a product source, those alternate sources may not be available at the time of any interruption, and alternative products may not be available at comparable quality and price.\nBoat manufacturers exercise substantial control over our business.\nWe depend on our dealer agreements. We have dealer agreements with Brunswick covering Sea Ray and Boston Whaler products. Each dealer agreement has a multi-year term and provides for the lowest product prices charged by the Sea Ray division of Brunswick or Boston Whaler, as applicable, from time to time to other domestic Sea Ray or Boston Whaler dealers, as applicable. These terms are subject to:\n\u2022\nthe dealer meeting all the requirements and conditions of the manufacturer\u2019s applicable programs; and\n\u2022\nthe right of Brunswick in good faith to charge lesser prices to other dealers\n\u2022\nto meet existing competitive circumstances;\n\u2022\nfor unusual and non-ordinary business circumstances; or\n\u2022\nfor limited duration promotional programs.\nEach dealer agreement designates a specific geographical territory for the dealer, which is exclusive to the dealer provided that the dealer is able to meet the material obligations of its dealer agreement.\nWe are the exclusive dealer for Azimut-Benetti Group\u2019s Azimut product line for the United States. The Azimut dealer agreement provides a geographic territory to promote the product line and to network with the appropriate clientele through various independent locations designated for Azimut retail sales. Our dealer agreement is a multi-year term but requires us to be in compliance with its terms and conditions.\nAs is typical in the industry, we generally deal with manufacturers, other than Sea Ray and Boston Whaler (both divisions of Brunswick) and Azimut, under renewable annual dealer agreements. These agreements do not contain any contractual provisions\nconcerning product pricing or required purchasing levels. Pricing is generally established on a model year basis, but is subject to change in the manufacturer\u2019s sole discretion. Any change or termination of these arrangements for any reason could adversely affect product availability and cost and our financial performance.\nThrough these dealer agreements, boat manufacturers (particularly Brunswick and Azimut) exercise significant control over their dealers, restrict them to specified locations, and retain approval rights over changes in management and ownership, among other things. Failure to meet the customer satisfaction, market share goals, and other conditions set forth in any dealer agreement could have various consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe termination of the dealer agreement;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional conditions in subsequent dealer agreements;\n\u2022\nlimitations on boat inventory allocations;\n\u2022\nreductions in reimbursement rates for warranty work performed by the dealer;\n\u2022\nloss of certain manufacturer to dealer incentives;\n\u2022\ndenial of approval of future acquisitions; or\n\u2022\nthe loss of exclusive rights to sell in the geographic territory.\nThese events could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and financial performance.\nOur business, as well as the entire recreational boating industry, is highly seasonal, with seasonality varying in different geographic markets.\nOver the three-year period ended September 30, 2020, the average revenue for the quarterly periods ended December 31, March 31, June 30 and September 30 represented approximately 20%, 22%, 32%, and 26%, respectively, of our average annual revenue. With the exception of Florida, we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories and related short-term borrowings in the quarterly periods ending December 31 and March 31. The onset of the public boat and recreation shows in January typically stimulates boat sales and allows us to reduce our inventory levels and related short-term borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Our business could become substantially more seasonal if we acquire dealers that operate in colder regions of the United States, which are generally closed or experience lower volume in the winter months.\nThe failure to receive rebates and other dealer incentives on inventory purchases or retail sales could substantially reduce our margins.\nWe rely on manufacturers\u2019 programs that provide incentives for dealers to purchase and sell particular boat makes and models or for consumers to buy particular boat makes or models. Any eliminations, reductions, limitations, or other changes relating to rebate or incentive programs that have the effect of reducing the benefits we receive, whether relating to the ability of manufacturers to pay or our ability to qualify for such incentive programs, could increase the effective cost of our boat purchases, reduce our margins and competitive position, and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOther recreational activities, poor industry perception, and potential health risks from environmental conditions can adversely affect the levels of boat purchases.\nDemand for our products can be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers\u2019 time, including other forms of recreation as well as religious, cultural and community activities. In addition, real or perceived health risks from engaging in outdoor activities and local environmental conditions in the areas in which we operate dealerships could adversely affect the levels of boat purchases. Further, as a seller of high-end consumer products, we must compete for discretionary spending with a wide variety of other recreational activities and consumer purchases. In addition, perceived hassles of boat ownership and customer service and lack of customer education throughout the retail boat industry, which has traditionally been perceived to be relatively poor, represent impediments to boat purchases.\nWe face intense competition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. In addition to facing competition generally from recreation businesses seeking to attract consumers\u2019 leisure time and discretionary spending dollars, the recreational boat industry itself is highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition for customers, quality products, boat show space, and suitable retail locations. We rely to a certain extent on boat shows to generate sales.\nWe compete primarily with single-location boat dealers and, with respect to sales of marine parts, accessories, and equipment, with national specialty marine parts and accessories stores, online catalog retailers, sporting goods stores, and mass merchants. Competition among boat dealers is based on the quality of available products, the price and value of the products, and attention to customer service. There is significant competition both within markets we currently serve and in new markets that we may enter. We compete in each of our markets with retailers of brands of boats and engines we do not sell in that market. In addition, several of our competitors, especially those selling marine equipment and accessories, are large national or regional chains that have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. Private sales of used boats represent an additional source of competition.\nDue to various matters, including environmental concerns, permitting and zoning requirements, and competition for waterfront real estate, some markets in the United States have experienced an increased waiting list for marina and storage availability. In general, the markets in which we currently operate are not experiencing any unusual difficulties. However, marine retail activity could be adversely affected in markets that do not have sufficient marine and storage availability to satisfy demand.\nTiming of large boat and yacht sales and failure to adequately anticipate consumer preference and demand may have an adverse impact on our business.\nForecasting optimal inventory levels is difficult to predict based on, among other things, changes in economic conditions, consumer preferences, delivery of new models from manufacturers, and timing of large boat and yacht sales. Failure to adequately anticipate consumer demand and preferences could negatively impact our inventory management strategies, inventory carrying costs, and our operating margins.\nStrategy Risk Factors\nFailure to implement strategies to enhance our performance or our strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are increasing our efforts to grow our financing and insurance, parts and accessories, service, yacht charter, brokerage, and boat storage businesses to better serve our customers and thereby increase revenue and improve profitability as a result of these higher margin businesses. In addition, we have implemented programs to increase the lead capture and digital sales of used boats, parts, accessories, and a wide range of boating supplies and products. These efforts and programs are designed to increase our revenue and reduce our dependence on the sale of new boats. We are also pursuing certain acquisitions as discussed in the immediately following Risk Factors. These business initiatives have required, and will continue to require, us to add personnel, invest capital, enter businesses in which we do not have extensive experience, and encounter substantial competition. As a result, our strategies to enhance our performance may not be successful and we may increase our expenses or write off such investments if not successful.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to make successful acquisitions at attractive or fair prices and to integrate the operations of acquired dealers and each dealer we acquire in the future.\nSince March 1, 1998, we have acquired 30 recreational boat dealers, four boat brokerage operations, and two full-service yacht repair facilities. Each acquired dealer and entity operated independently prior to its acquisition by us. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to make successful acquisitions at attractive or fair prices that align with our culture and focus on customer service and to integrate the operations of acquired dealers, including centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and pursuing programs and processes that promote cooperation and the sharing of opportunities and resources among our dealerships. We may not be able to oversee the combined entity efficiently, realize anticipated synergies, or implement effectively our growth and operating strategies. To the extent that we successfully pursue our acquisition strategy, our resulting growth will place significant additional demands on our management and infrastructure. Our failure to pursue successfully our acquisition strategies or operate effectively the combined entity could have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth and operating performance.\nWe may pursue acquisition strategies in new lines of business.\nWe have historically pursued strategic acquisitions to capitalize upon the consolidation opportunities in the highly fragmented recreational boat dealer industry by acquiring additional dealers and related operations and improving their performance and profitability through the implementation of our operating strategies. We have also recently pursued, and may continue to pursue, potential contract manufacturing, vertical integration strategies, yacht charter and brokerage, marinas, boat storage, or other acquisitions as opportunities arise. To the extent we are successful in pursuing one or more of these strategies, we will face certain risks in addition to those that exist with acquisitions more closely related to our historical business, including potential inexperience in a line of business that is either new to us or that has become materially more significant to us as a result of a transaction, the potential difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image, greater uncertainties in the financial benefits and potential liabilities associated with this expanded base of acquisitions, different types of legal and operational risks, and different types of applicable financial metrics and\ngoals. Our failure to pursue successfully our acquisition strategies in new lines of business, operate effectively the combined entity, and/or mitigate any potential new risks, could have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth and operating performance.\nUnforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our profitability.\nThe acquisition of additional recreational boat dealers, boat storage facilities, yacht brokerage operations, and marinas, which is one of our growth strategies, and vertical integration strategies, all involve significant risks. This strategy entails reviewing and potentially reorganizing acquired business operations, corporate infrastructure and systems, and financial controls. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our profitability. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in expected returns required by our acquisition criteria to be in the best interest of shareholders. Acquisitions also may become more difficult or less attractive in the future as we acquire more of the most attractive dealers that best align with our culture and focus on customer service. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in integrating the operations of acquired dealers with our own operations, difficulties in retaining employees, potential risks of losing customers, suppliers, or other business relationships, and difficulties in managing acquired dealers profitably without substantial costs, delays, or other operational or financial problems.\nOur ability to continue to grow through acquisitions depends upon various factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe availability of suitable acquisition candidates at attractive purchase prices;\n\u2022\nthe ability to compete effectively for available acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe availability of cash on hand, borrowed funds or stock with a sufficient value to complete the acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain any requisite manufacturer or governmental approvals;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain approval of our lenders under our current credit agreement; and\n\u2022\nthe absence of one or more manufacturers attempting to impose unsatisfactory restrictions on us in connection with their approval of acquisitions.\nIf we finance future acquisitions in whole or in part through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, existing shareholders will experience dilution in the voting power of their common stock and earnings per share could be negatively impacted. Any borrowings made to finance future acquisitions or for operations could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our operating results, a downturn in economic conditions, or increases in interest rates on borrowings that are subject to interest rate fluctuations.\nWe may be required to obtain the consent of Brunswick and various other manufacturers prior to the acquisition of other dealers.\nIn determining whether to approve acquisitions, manufacturers may consider many factors, including our financial condition and ownership structure. Manufacturers also may impose conditions on granting their approvals for acquisitions, including a limitation on the number of their dealers that we may acquire. Our ability to meet manufacturers\u2019 requirements for approving future acquisitions will have a direct bearing on our ability to complete acquisitions and effect our growth strategy. There can be no assurance that a manufacturer will not terminate its dealer agreement, refuse to renew its dealer agreement, refuse to approve future acquisitions, or take other action that could have a material adverse effect on our acquisition program.\nOur internal growth and operating strategies of opening new locations and offering new products involve risk.\nIn addition to pursuing growth by acquiring boat dealers, we intend to continue to pursue a strategy of growth through opening new retail locations and offering new products in our existing and new territories. This strategy may entail obtaining additional distribution rights from our existing and new manufacturers. We may not be able to secure additional distribution rights or obtain suitable alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain such distribution rights. The inability to expand our product lines and geographic scope by obtaining additional distribution rights could have a material adverse effect on the growth and profitability of our business.\nAccomplishing these goals for expansion will depend upon a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to identify new markets in which we can obtain distribution rights to sell our existing or additional product lines;\n\u2022\nour ability to lease or construct suitable facilities at a reasonable cost in existing or new markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire, train, and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nthe timely and effective integration of new retail locations into existing operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve adequate market penetration at favorable operating margins without the acquisition of existing dealers; and\n\u2022\nour financial resources.\nOur dealer agreements with Brunswick require Brunswick\u2019s consent to open, close, or change retail locations that sell Sea Ray or Boston Whaler products as applicable, and other dealer agreements generally contain similar provisions. We may not be able to open and operate new retail locations or introduce new product lines on a timely or profitable basis. Moreover, the costs associated with opening new retail locations or introducing new product lines may adversely affect our profitability.\nAs a result of these growth strategies, we expect to continue to expend significant time and effort in opening and acquiring new retail locations, improving existing retail locations in our current markets, and introducing new products. Our systems, procedures, controls, financial resources, and management and staffing levels may not be adequate to support expanding operations. The inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition to our traditional repeat and referral business in our physical locations, digital channels are increasingly significant in serving our existing customer base and reaching new customers. Our continued expansion and success will be negatively impacted if we are not able to fully exploit these channels.\nOur digital channels are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in technology;\n\u2022\ncybersecurity risk;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer willingness to conduct business electronically, including increasing concerns with consumer privacy and risk and changing laws, rules, and regulations, such as the imposition of or increase in taxes;\n\u2022\ntechnology or security impediments that may inhibit our ability to electronically market our products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable international, federal, state and commercial regulation;\n\u2022\nfailure of our service providers, suppliers or service partners to perform their services properly and in a timely and efficient manner;\n\u2022\nfailure to adequately respond to customers, process orders or deliver services;\n\u2022\nour failure to assess and evaluate our digital product and service offerings to ensure that our products and services are desired by boating enthusiasts; and\n\u2022\nthe potential exposure to liability with respect to third-party information, including but not limited to copyright, trademark infringement, or other wrongful acts of third parties; false or erroneous information provided by third parties; or illegal activities by third parties, such as the sale of stolen boats or other goods.\nFurther, we may also be vulnerable to competitive pressures from the growing electronic commerce activity in our market, both as they may impact our own on-line business, and as they may impact the operating results and investment values of our existing physical locations.\nVarious operations in multiple countries around the world expose us to international political, economic, foreign currency, and other risks.\nOur operations involve certain international activities, including our sales of yachts produced by the Azimut-Benetti Group in Italy, yachts produced by Galeon in Poland, and power catamarans for our charter fleet produced by Sino Eagle in China, as well as our Fraser Yacht and Northrop & Johnson operations. These activities in multiple countries around the world expose us to international political, economic, foreign currency, and other risks. Some of our sales and purchases of inventory are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong or weak U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues and our profitability. We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the\nU.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon the success and extent of our hedging activities.\nAdditionally, protectionist trade legislation in the United States, the European Union, Poland, or China, such as a change in current tariff structures, export or import compliance laws, or other trade policies could adversely affect our ability to import yachts from these foreign suppliers under economically favorable terms and conditions. There have been recent changes and additional changes may occur in the future, to United States and foreign trade and tax policies, including heightened import restrictions, import and export licenses, new tariffs, trade embargoes, government sanctions, and trade barriers. Any of these restrictions could prevent or make it difficult or more costly for us to import yachts from foreign suppliers under economically favorable terms and conditions. Increased tariffs could require us to increase our prices which likely could decrease demand for our products. In addition, other countries may limit their trade with the United States or retaliate through their own restrictions and/or increased tariffs which would affect our ability to export products and therefore adversely affect our sales. Many of these challenges, particularly tariffs, are present in commerce with China, a market from which we purchase products. While such tariffs may be delayed or cancelled before coming into effect and we believe we have taken steps to mitigate their potential effects, such tariffs would likely increase our costs for our Chinese suppliers.\nOur international operations create a number of logistical and communications challenges. The economic, political and other risks we face resulting from these operations include the following:\n\u2022 compliance with U.S. and local laws and regulatory requirements, including labor, tax, and environmental, health and safety, as well as changes in those laws and requirements;\n\u2022 transportation delays or interruptions and other effects of less developed infrastructures;\n\u2022 effects from the voter-approved exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (often referred to as Brexit), including any resulting deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse regulatory changes;\n\u2022 limitations on imports and exports;\n\u2022 adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022 imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;\n\u2022 withdrawal from or revision to international trade agreements;\n\u2022 national and international conflicts, including foreign policy changes, political or economic instability, or terrorist acts;\n\u2022 the effects of issued or threatened government sanctions, tariffs and duties, trade barriers or economic restrictions;\n\u2022 maintenance of quality standards; and/or\n\u2022 possible employee turnover or labor unrest.\nOperational Risk Factors\nThe availability and costs of borrowed funds can adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate boat inventory and the ability and willingness of our customers to finance boat purchases.\nThe availability and costs of borrowed funds can adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain adequate boat inventory and the holding costs of that inventory as well as the ability and willingness of our customers to finance boat purchases. We rely on the Credit Facility led by Wells Fargo Commercial Distribution Finance LLC to purchase and maintain our inventory of boats. The Credit Facility provides a floor plan financing commitment of up to $440.0 million. The collateral for the Credit Facility is all of our personal property with certain limited exceptions. None of our real estate has been pledged for collateral for the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facility and our additional available borrowings under the Credit Facility was approximately $82.0 million based upon the outstanding borrowing base availability.\nOur ability to borrow under the Credit Facility depends on our ability to continue to satisfy our covenants and other obligations under the Credit Facility and the ability for our manufacturers to be approved vendors under our Credit Facility. The variable interest rate under our Credit Facility will fluctuate with changing market conditions and, accordingly, our interest expense will increase as interest rates rise. A significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. The aging of our inventory limits our borrowing capacity as defined provisions in the Credit Facility reduce the allowable advance rate as our inventory ages. Depressed economic conditions, weak consumer spending, turmoil in the credit markets, and lender difficulties, among other potential reasons, could interfere with our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and to utilize the Credit\nFacility to fund our operations. Any inability to utilize the Credit Facility or the acceleration of amounts owed, resulting from a covenant violation, insufficient collateral, or lender difficulties, could require us to seek other sources of funding to repay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility or replace or supplement the Credit Facility, which may not be possible at all or under commercially reasonable terms.\nSimilarly, decreases in the availability of credit and increases in the cost of credit adversely affect the ability of our customers to purchase boats from us and thereby adversely affect our ability to sell our products and impact the profitability of our finance and insurance activities.\nHigher energy and fuel costs along with adequate supply may adversely affect our business.\nAll of the recreational boats we sell are powered by diesel or gasoline engines. Consequently, an interruption in the supply, or a significant increase in the price or tax on the sale of fuel on a regional or national basis could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results. Increases in fuel prices negatively impact boat sales. The supply of fuels may be interrupted, rationing may be imposed, or the price of or tax on fuels may significantly increase in the future, adversely impacting our business. Also, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of the marine products produced by boat manufacturers increasing our cost of inventory. Additionally, higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our parts and accessories business, because higher fuel prices increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use.\nThe availability of boat insurance is critical to our success.\nThe ability of our customers to secure reasonably affordable boat insurance that is satisfactory to lenders that finance our customers\u2019 purchases is critical to our success. Any difficulty of customers to obtain affordable boat insurance could impede boat sales and adversely affect our business.\nElements of our yacht charter and charter brokerage businesses expose us to certain risks.\nOur yacht charter business entails the sale of specifically designed yachts to third parties for inclusion in our yacht charter fleet; a yacht management agreement under which yacht owners enable us to put their yachts in our yacht charter program for a period of several years for a fixed monthly fee payable by us; our services in storing, insuring, and maintaining their yachts; and the charter by us of these yachts to vacation customers at agreed fees payable to us. Our failure to find purchasers for yachts intended for our charter fleet will increase our boat inventory and related operating costs; lack of sales into our charter fleet may result in increased losses due to market adjustments of our yacht charter inventory; and our failure to generate a sufficient number of vacation charter customers will require us to absorb all the costs of the monthly fees to the yacht owners as well as other operating costs.\nCustomers consider safety and reliability a primary concern in selecting a yacht charter provider. The yacht charter business may present a number of safety risks including, but not limited to, catastrophic disaster, adverse weather and marine conditions, such as Hurricane Irma in 2017, mechanical failure and collision, and health issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to maintain acceptable records for safety and reliability, our ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected. Additionally, any safety issue encountered during a yacht charter may result in claims against us as well as negative publicity. Beginning in March 2020, we have temporarily closed our facilities in the British Virgin Islands and yacht charters based on guidance from local government and health officials as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Additionally, our yacht charter brokerage business in Europe has slowed as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic. We expect yacht charters and our charter brokerage business to resume during fiscal 2021, but impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time. These events could have a material adverse effect on the competitive position and financial performance of both our yacht charter business and our core retail sales business.\nThe yacht charter business is also highly fragmented, consisting primarily of local operators and franchisees. Competition among charter operators is based on location, the type and size of yachts offered, charter rates, destinations serviced, and attention to customer service. Yacht charters also face competition from other travel and leisure options, including, but not limited to, cruises, hotels, resorts, theme parks, organized tours, land-based casino operators, and vacation ownership properties. We therefore risk losing business not only to other charter operators, but also to vacation operators that provide such alternatives.\nWe depend on income from financing, insurance and extended service contracts.\nA portion of our income results from referral fees derived from the placement or marketing of various finance and insurance, or F&I products, consisting of customer financing, insurance products, and extended service contracts, the most significant component of which is the participation and other fees resulting from our sale of customer financing contracts.\nThe availability of financing for our boat purchasers and the level of participation and other fees we receive in connection with such financing depend on the particular agreement between us and the lender and the current rate environment. Lenders may impose terms in their boat financing arrangements with us that may be unfavorable to us or our customers. Laws or regulations may be enacted nationally or locally which could result in fees from lenders being eliminated or reduced, materially impacting our operating results. If customer financing becomes more difficult to secure, it may adversely impact our business.\nChanges, including the lengthening of manufacturer warranties, may reduce our ability to offer and sell extended service contracts which may have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell F&I products.\nThe reduction of profit margins on sales of F&I products or the lack of demand for or the unavailability of these products could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins.\nOur continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of our MarineMax brand which, if impaired, could adversely affect our sales.\nWe believe that our MarineMax brand is one of the reasons our customers choose to come to us for their boating needs. To be successful, we must preserve our reputation. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions, and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us. It may be difficult to control negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. While reputations may take decades to build, any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in significant negative mainstream and/or social media publicity, governmental investigations, or litigation. Additionally, an isolated business incident at a single retail location could materially adversely affect our other stores, retail brands, reputation and sales channels, particularly if such incident results in significant adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Negative incidents, such as quality and safety concerns or incidents related to our manufacturers\u2019 products, could lead to tangible adverse effects on our business, including lost sales or team member retention and recruiting difficulties. In addition, vendors and others with whom we choose to do business may affect our reputation.\nOur operations are dependent upon key personnel and team members.\nOur success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract, train and retain, qualified team members and executive officers, as well as the continuing efforts and abilities of team members and executive officers. Although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers and management succession plans, we cannot ensure that these or other executive personnel and team members will remain with us, or that our succession planning will adequately mitigate the risk associated with key personnel transitions. As a result of our decentralized operating strategy, we also rely on the management teams of our dealerships. In addition, we likely will depend on the senior management of any significant businesses we acquire in the future.\nThe products we sell, or services we provide, may expose us to potential liability for personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of those products.\nManufacturers of the products we sell generally maintain product liability insurance. We also maintain third-party product liability insurance that we believe to be adequate. We may experience claims that are not covered by, or that are in excess of, our insurance coverage. The institution of any significant claims against us could subject us to damages, result in higher insurance costs, and harm our business reputation with potential customers.\nEnvironmental and Geographic Risk Factors\nWeather and environmental conditions may adversely impact our business.\nWeather and environmental conditions may adversely impact our operating results. For example, drought conditions, reduced rainfall levels, excessive rain and environmental conditions, and hurricanes may force boating areas to close or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby curtailing customer demand for our products. While we traditionally maintain a full range of insurance coverage for any such events, there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage is adequate to cover losses that we sustain as a result of such disasters. In addition, unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to shorter selling seasons in certain locations. Many of our dealerships sell boats to customers for use on reservoirs, thereby subjecting our business to the continued viability of these reservoirs for boating use. Although our geographic diversity and any future geographic expansion should reduce the overall impact on us of adverse weather and environmental conditions in any one market area, weather and environmental conditions will continue to represent potential material adverse risks to us and our future operating performance. Additionally, to the extent unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change, regardless of the cause, resulting\nin environmental changes including, but not limited to, severe weather, changing sea levels, poor water conditions, or reduced access to water, which could disrupt or negatively affect our business.\nEnvironmental and climate changes could affect our business.\nWe operate many retail locations near or on bodies of water that are acutely susceptible to the risks associated with climate change. Such risks include those related to the physical impacts of climate change, such as more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and/or long term shifts in climate patterns, and risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, such as reputational, market and/or regulatory risks. Climate change and climate events could result in social, cultural and economic disruptions in these areas, including supply chain disruptions, the disruption of local infrastructure and transportation systems that could limit the ability of our team members and our customers to access our retail locations. These events could also compound adverse economic conditions and impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending.\nA significant amount of our boat sales are from the State of Florida.\nEconomic conditions, weather and environmental conditions, competition, market conditions, and any other adverse conditions impacting the State of Florida in which we generated approximately 51%, 54% and 54% of our revenue during fiscal 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, could have a major impact on our operations.\nEnvironmental and other regulatory issues may impact our operations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and licensing under various federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations, such as those relating to finance and insurance, consumer protection, consumer privacy, escheatment, anti-money laundering, environmental, emissions, health or safety, U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and employment practices. With respect to employment practices, we are subject to various laws and regulations, including complex federal, state and local wage and hour and anti-discrimination laws. The failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as potentially the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, changes to our processes, or a cessation of our operations, and/or damage to our image and reputation.\nVarious federal, state, and local regulatory agencies, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), and similar federal and local agencies, have jurisdiction over the operation of our dealerships, repair facilities, and other operations, with respect to matters such as consumer protection, workers\u2019 safety, and laws regarding protection of the environment, including air, water, and soil. The EPA promulgated emissions regulations for outboard marine engines that impose stricter emissions standards for two-cycle, gasoline outboard marine engines. It is possible that environmental regulatory bodies (including state regulatory bodies) may impose higher emissions standards in the future for these and other marine engines. Any increased costs of producing engines resulting from current or potentially higher EPA or state standards in the future could be passed on to our company, or could result in the inability or potential unforeseen delays of our manufacturers to comply with current and future EPA or state requirements, and these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCertain of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks (\u201cUSTs\u201d), and above ground storage tanks (\u201cASTs\u201d) for the storage of various petroleum products. USTs and ASTs are generally subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that require testing and upgrading of tanks and remediation of contaminated soils and groundwater resulting from leaking tanks. In addition, we may be subject to civil liability to third parties for remediation costs or other damages if leakage from our owned or operated tanks migrates onto the property of others.\nOur business involves the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, including environmentally sensitive materials, such as motor oil, waste motor oil and filters, transmission fluid, antifreeze, freon, waste paint and lacquer thinner, batteries, solvents, lubricants, degreasing agents, gasoline and diesel fuels. Accordingly, we are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities establishing investigation and health and environmental quality standards, and liability related thereto, and providing penalties for violations of those standards.\nWe also are subject to laws, ordinances, and regulations governing investigation and remediation of contamination at facilities we operate or to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. In particular, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d or \u201cSuperfund\u201d) imposes joint, strict, and several liability on:\n\u2022\nowners or operators of facilities at, from, or to which a release of hazardous substances has occurred;\n\u2022\nparties that generated hazardous substances that were released at such facilities; and\n\u2022\nparties that transported or arranged for the transportation of hazardous substances to such facilities.\nA majority of states have adopted Superfund statutes comparable to and, in some cases, more stringent than CERCLA. If we were to be found to be a responsible party under CERCLA or a similar state statute, we could be held liable for all investigative and remedial costs associated with addressing such contamination. In addition, claims alleging personal injury or property damage may be brought against us as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances resulting from our operations. In addition, certain of our retail locations are located on waterways that are subject to federal or state laws regulating navigable waters (including oil pollution prevention), fish and wildlife, and other matters.\nSoil and groundwater contamination has been known to exist at certain properties owned or leased by us. We have also been required and may in the future be required to remove aboveground and underground storage tanks containing hazardous substances or wastes. As to certain of our properties, specific releases of petroleum have been or are in the process of being remediated in accordance with state and federal guidelines. We are monitoring the soil and groundwater as required by applicable state and federal guidelines. We also may have additional storage tank liability insurance and Superfund coverage where applicable. Environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change. Compliance with amended, new or more stringent laws or regulations, more strict interpretations of existing laws, or the future discovery of environmental conditions may require additional expenditures by us, and such expenditures may be material.\nAdditionally, certain states have required or are considering requiring a license in order to operate a recreational boat. These regulations could discourage potential buyers, thereby limiting future sales and adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nGeneral economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact our operating results. Unfavorable local, regional, national, or global economic developments or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could reduce consumer spending in the markets we serve and adversely affect our business. Economic conditions in areas in which we operate dealerships, such as corporate downsizing, military base closings, and inclement weather such as hurricanes or other storms, environmental conditions, and specific events, such as the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, or Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017, also could adversely affect, and in certain instances have adversely affected, our operations in certain markets.\nIn an economic downturn, consumer discretionary spending levels generally decline, at times resulting in disproportionately large reductions in the sale of luxury goods. Consumer spending on luxury goods also may decline as a result of lower consumer confidence levels, even if prevailing economic conditions are favorable. As a result, an economic downturn could impact us more than certain of our competitors due to our strategic focus on a higher end of our market.\nUnfavorable economic conditions can cause us to reduce our acquisition program, delay new store openings, reduce our inventory purchases, engage in inventory reduction efforts, close a number of our retail locations, reduce our headcount, and amend and replace our credit facility, and could also interfere with our supply of certain brands by manufacturers, reduce marketing and other support by manufacturers, decrease revenue, put additional pressures on margins, and result in our failure to satisfy covenants under our credit agreement.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by the widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has spread in many of the geographic areas in which we operate. National, state and local governments in affected regions have implemented and will continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures, for an indefinite time period. Other organizations and individuals are taking additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and staying home from work. These measures are disrupting normal business operations both in and outside of affected areas and have had significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide.\nWe continue to monitor our operations and government recommendations and have made modifications to our normal operations, including taking proactive steps to enhance financial flexibility including working to extract capital from our debt-free sizable real estate holdings, taking action to monetize our unlevered inventory, implementing operating cost savings plans, and delaying or reducing capital expenditures. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a number of adverse impacts, including\nreductions in demand for our products, inefficiencies caused by team members working remotely, and certain closed departments or locations based on guidance from each local government or health officials. Disruptions in the capital markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak may also adversely affect us if these impacts continue for a prolonged period and we need additional liquidity. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the entirety of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, customers, suppliers or other business partners, depending on the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic the length of time of its impact and the applicable government actions in response to it, the effect of the adverse impacts identified in this paragraph may increase and additional adverse impacts may arise.\nAdverse federal or state tax policies can have a negative effect on us.\nChanges in federal and state tax laws, such as an imposition of luxury taxes on new boat purchases, increases in prevailing federal or state tax rates, and removal of certain interest deductions, also influence consumers\u2019 decisions to purchase products we offer and could have a negative effect on our sales. For example, during 1991 and 1992, the federal government imposed a luxury tax on new recreational boats with sales prices in excess of $100,000, which coincided with a sharp decline in boating industry sales from a high of more than $17.9 billion in 1988 to a low of $10.3 billion in 1992.\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, data and our third-party service providers. Our business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our informational technology systems or a cybersecurity event.\nOur business is dependent upon the efficient operation of our information systems. The systems facilitate the interchange of information and enhance cross-selling opportunities throughout our company. The systems integrate each level of operations on a Company-wide basis, including but not limited to purchasing, inventory, receivables, payables, financial reporting, budgeting, marketing, sales management, as well as to prepare our consolidated financial and operating data. The failure of our information systems to perform as designed or the failure to maintain and enhance or protect the integrity of these systems and the systems of our third-party service providers, could disrupt our business operations, impact sales and the results of operations, expose us to customer or third-party claims, or result in adverse publicity.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose a risk to the security of our and our customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and third-party service providers\u2019 products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members, contractors, vendors, and temporary staff. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, systems, monitoring and testing, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats.\nWe may also have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy, security laws, and regulations. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we and our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, and operational disruptions.\nIt is possible that we or our third-party service providers might not be aware of a successful cyber-related attack on our systems until well after the incident. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may have obligations to notify customers and/or employees about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident, which could result in material reputational damage to us.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries concerning the handling of personal information, including laws that require us to notify governmental authorities and/or affected individuals of data breaches involving certain personal information. These laws and regulations include, for example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), effective January 2020. Regulatory actions or litigation seeking to impose significant penalties could be brought against us in the event of a data breach or alleged non-compliance with such laws and regulations.\nThe timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.\nIn March 2020, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan authorizing the Company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its commons stock through March 2022. There is no guarantee that our stock repurchase plans will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of stock options and stock-based grants. The success of our stock repurchase plans is based upon a number of factors, including the price and availability of the Company\u2019s stock, general market conditions, the nature of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time, and the availability of cash.\nWe do not pay cash dividends.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and we have no current intention to do so for the foreseeable future.\nOur sales may be adversely impacted by a material increase in interest rates and adverse changes in fiscal policy or credit market conditions.\nOver the past several years, our economy has been positively impacted by historically unprecedented low interest rates. Such interest rates, driven by the policies of the Federal Reserve, can be a political issue in the United States. Any change by the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate in the future or market expectations of such change may result in significantly higher long-term interest rates, which may negatively impact our customers\u2019 willingness or desire to purchase our products.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method by which LIBOR is determined.\nWe rely on the Credit Facility led by Wells Fargo Commercial Distribution Finance LLC to purchase and maintain our inventory of boats. The interest rate for amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility is 345 basis points above the one-month LIBOR. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the regulatory authority over LIBOR) stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rate indices after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternate reference rate. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents the best alternative to LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of SOFR as the dominant replacement. The market transition away from LIBOR towards SOFR is expected to be complicated. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR. Although the full impact of any transition away from LIBOR, including the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR publication, remains unclear, these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing, including LIBOR-based loans, the terms of our Credit Facility, and on our financing costs.", "PERMNO": 86128, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "HZO"}
