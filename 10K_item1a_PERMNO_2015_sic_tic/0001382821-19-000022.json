{"cik": "1382821", "company": "Redfin Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before investing in any of our securities. The occurrence of any single risk or any combination of risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, liquidity, or competitive position, and consequently, the value of our securities. The material adverse effects include, but are not limited to, not growing our revenue or market share at the pace that they have grown historically or at all, our revenue and market share fluctuating on a quarterly and annual basis, an extension of our history of losses and a failure to become profitable, not achieving the revenue and net income (loss) guidance that we provide, and harm to our reputation and brand.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe health of the U.S. residential real estate industry and macroeconomic factors may significantly impact our business.\nOur success depends largely on the health of the U.S. residential real estate industry. This industry, in turn, is affected by changes in general economic conditions, which are beyond our control. Any of the following factors could adversely affect the industry and harm our business:\n\u2022\nseasonal or cyclical downturns in the U.S. residential real estate industry, which may be due to any single factor, or a combination of factors, listed below, or factors which are currently not known to us or that have not historically affected the industry;\n\u2022\nslow economic growth or recessionary conditions;\n\u2022\nincreased unemployment rates or stagnant or declining wages;\n\u2022\ninflationary conditions;\n\u2022\nlow consumer confidence in the economy or the U.S. residential real estate industry;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in local or regional economic conditions in the markets that we serve, particularly our top-10 markets and markets into which we are attempting to expand;\n\u2022\nincreased mortgage rates; reduced availability of mortgage financing; or increased down payment requirements;\n\u2022\nlow home inventory levels, which may result from zoning regulations and higher construction costs, among other factors;\n\u2022\nlack of affordably priced homes, which may result from home prices growing faster than wages;\n\u2022\nvolatility and general declines in the stock market or lower yields on individuals' investment portfolios;\n\u2022\nnewly enacted and potential federal and state legislative actions that would adversely affect the U.S. residential real estate industry, such as (i) the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017 and limited deductions of certain mortgage interest expenses and property taxes and (ii) potential reform relating to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government sponsored entities that provide liquidity to the mortgage market;\n\u2022\nchanges that cause U.S. real estate to be more expensive for foreign purchases, such as (i) increases in the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies and (ii)\nforeign regulatory changes or capital controls that make it more difficult for foreign purchasers to withdraw capital from their home countries or purchase and hold U.S. real estate;\n\u2022\nchanged generational views on homeownership and generally decreased financial resources available for purchasing homes; and\n\u2022\nwar, terrorism, political uncertainty, natural disasters, inclement weather, and acts of God.\nOur business is concentrated in certain geographic markets. Disruptions in these markets or events that disproportionately affect those markets could harm our business. Furthermore, our failure to adapt to any substantial shift in the relative percentage of residential housing transactions from those markets to other markets in the United States could adversely affect our financial performance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our top-10 markets consisted of the metropolitan areas of Boston, Chicago, Denver (including Boulder and Colorado Springs), Los Angeles (including Santa Barbara), Maryland, Northern Virginia, Portland (including Bend), San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle.\nLocal and regional economic conditions in these markets may differ significantly from prevailing conditions in the United States or other parts of the country. Accordingly, events may adversely and disproportionately affect demand for and sales prices of homes in these markets. Any overall or disproportionate downturn in demand or home prices in any of our largest markets, particularly if we are unable to increase revenue from our other markets, could result in a decline in our revenue and harm our business.\nOur top markets are primarily major metropolitan areas, where home prices and transaction volumes are generally higher than other markets. As a result, our real estate services revenue and gross margin are generally higher in these markets than in our smaller markets. To the extent people migrate to cities outside of these markets due to lower home prices or other factors, and this migration continues to take place over the long-term, then the relative percentage of residential housing transactions may shift away from our historical top markets where we have historically generated most of our revenue. If we are unable to effectively adapt to any shift, including failing to increase revenue from other markets, then our financial performance may be harmed.\nCompetition in each of our lines of business is intense, and if we cannot compete effectively, our business will be harmed.\nWe face intense competition nationally and in each of the markets we serve for each of our businesses - residential brokerage, mortgage, title and escrow, and buying and selling homes directly. Please see \"Competition\" under Item 1 of this Annual Report for a general discussion of the competitive conditions in each of our businesses.\nMany of our competitors across each of our businesses have substantial competitive advantages, such as longer operating histories, stronger brand recognition, greater financial resources, more management, sales, marketing and other resources, superior local referral networks, perceived local knowledge and expertise, and extensive relationships with participants in the residential real estate industry, including third-party data providers such as multiple listing services, or MLSs. Consequently, these competitors may have an advantage in recruiting and retaining agents, attracting consumers, and growing their businesses. They may also be able to provide consumers with offerings that are different from or superior to those we provide. The success of our competitors could result in our loss of market share and harm our business.\nEach of our businesses also faces competition from potential new entrants, particularly those driven by technology. These potential competitors may have substantial financial support that allows them to offer\nservices superior to ours. The introduction of additional competitors may also adversely impact our market share and harm our business.\nWe may be unable to maintain or improve our current technology offerings at a competitive level or develop new technology offerings that meet customer or agent expectations. Our technology offerings may also contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities.\nOur technology offerings, including tools, features, and products, are key to our competitive plan for attracting potential customers and hiring and retaining lead agents. Maintaining or improving our current technology to meet evolving industry standards and customer and agent expectations, as well as developing commercially successful and innovative new technology, is challenging and expensive. For example, the nature of development cycles may result in delays between the time we incur expenses and the time we introduce new technology and generate revenue, if any, from those investments. Anticipated customer demand for a technology offering could also decrease after the development cycle has commenced, and we would not be able to recoup costs, which may be substantial, we incurred.\nAs standards and expectations evolve and new technology becomes available, we may not be able to identify, design, develop, and implement, in a timely and cost-effective manner, new technology offerings to meet those standards and expectations. As a result, we may be unable to compete effectively, and to the extent our competitors develop new technology offerings faster than us, they may render our offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Additionally, even if we implemented new technology offerings in a timely manner, our customers and agents may not accept or be satisfied by the offerings.\nFurthermore, our development and testing processes may not detect errors and vulnerabilities in our technology offerings prior to their implementation. Any inefficiencies, errors, technical problems, or vulnerabilities arising in our technology offerings after their release could reduce the quality of our services or interfere with our customers' and agents' access to and use of our technology and offerings.\nWe may be unable to obtain and provide comprehensive and accurate real estate listings quickly, or at all.\nWe believe that users of our website and mobile application come to us primarily because of the real estate listing data that we provide. Accordingly, if we were unable to obtain and provide comprehensive and accurate real estate listings data, our primary channels for meeting customers will be diminished. We get listings data primarily from MLSs in the markets we serve. We also source listings data from public records, other third-party listing providers, and individual homeowners and brokers. Many of our competitors and other real estate websites also have access to MLSs and other listings data, including proprietary data, and may be able to source listings data or other real estate information faster or more efficiently than we can. Since MLS participation is voluntary, brokers and homeowners may decline to post their listings data to their local MLS or may seek to change or limit the way that data is distributed. A competitor or another industry participant could also create an alternative listings data service, which may reduce the relevancy and comprehensive nature of the MLSs. If MLSs cease to be the predominant source of listings data in the markets that we serve, we may be unable to get access to comprehensive listings data on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may result in fewer people using our website and mobile application.\nWe rely on business data to make decisions and drive our machine-learning technology, and errors or inaccuracies in such data may adversely affect our business decisions and the customer experience.\nWe regularly analyze business data to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, establish budgets, and make strategic decisions. Much of this data is internally generated and has not been independently verified. While our business decisions are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring and interpreting the data, and we cannot be certain that the data are accurate. Errors or inaccuracies in the data could result in poor business decisions, resource allocation, or strategic initiatives. For example, if we\noverestimate traffic to our website and mobile application, we may not invest an adequate amount of resources in attracting new customers or we may hire more lead agents in a given market than necessary to meet customer demand.\nWe also use our business data and proprietary algorithms to inform our machine learning, such as in the calculation of our Redfin Estimate, which provides an estimate on the market value of individual homes. If customers disagree with us or if our Redfin Estimate fails to accurately reflect market pricing such that we are unable to attract homebuyers or help our customers sell their homes at satisfactory prices, or at all, customers may lose confidence in us.\nWe may be unable to attract homebuyers and home sellers to our website and mobile application in a cost-effective manner.\nOur website and mobile application are our primary channels for meeting customers. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to attract homebuyers and home sellers to our website and mobile application in a cost-effective manner. To meet customers, we rely heavily on traffic generated from search engines and downloads of our mobile application from mobile application stores. We also rely on marketing methods such as search engine optimization, targeted email campaigns, paid search advertising, social media marketing, and traditional media, including TV, radio, and billboard. In 2019 we intend to significantly increase our spending on mass media marketing.\nThe number of visitors to our website and mobile application downloads depends in large part on how and where our website and mobile application rank in Internet search results and mobile application stores, respectively. While we use search engine optimization to help our website rank highly in search results, maintaining or improving our search result rankings is not within our control. Internet search engines frequently update and change their ranking algorithms, referral methodologies, or design layouts, which determine the placement and display of a user\u2019s search results. In some instances, Internet search engines may change these rankings in order to promote their own competing services or the services of one or more of our competitors. Similarly, mobile application stores can change how they display searches and how mobile applications are featured. For instance, editors at the Apple iTunes Store can feature prominently editor-curated mobile applications and cause the mobile application to appear larger than other applications or more visibly on a featured list.\nOur marketing efforts, including our increased investment in mass media marketing in 2019, may fail to attract the desired number of additional customers. They may fail because, for example, the creative treatment for our advertisements may be ineffective or consumers may have find our advertisements offensive. Our efforts may also not succeed for reasons beyond our control, such as email providers implementing new or more restrictive email delivery policies and thereby making it more difficult for us to execute targeted email campaigns. Additionally, the paid advertising platforms that we use may raise their rates significantly, and, to the extent we choose to not pay the higher rates, we may use alternative platforms that may not be as effective. Furthermore, to the extent the social media platforms through which we advertise lose users or have users engaged at a less frequent rate, then our social media marketing may not produce the desired results.\nTo the extent we are unable to attract homebuyers and home sellers to our website and mobile applications through the methods described above or can do so only at a significant expense, our business may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices, whether through our mobile website or mobile application, we may be unable to attract and retain customers.\nDeveloping and supporting a mobile website and mobile application across multiple operating systems and devices requires substantial time and resources. We may not be able to consistently provide a rewarding customer experience on mobile devices and, as a result, customers we meet through our mobile\nwebsite or mobile application may not choose to use our services at the same rate as customers we meet through our website.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile operating systems are released, we may encounter problems in developing or supporting our mobile website or mobile application for them. Developing or supporting our mobile website or mobile application for new devices and their operating systems may require substantial time and resources. The success of our mobile website and mobile application could also be harmed by factors outside our control, such as:\n\u2022\nincreased costs to develop, distribute, or maintain our mobile website or mobile application;\n\u2022\nchanges to the terms of service or requirements of a mobile application store that requires us to change our mobile application development or features in an adverse manner; and\n\u2022\nchanges in mobile operating systems, such as Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android, that disproportionately affect us, degrade the functionality of our mobile website or mobile application, require that we make costly upgrades to our technology offerings, or give preferential treatment to competitors' websites or mobile applications.\nOur business model of employing lead agents subjects us to challenges not faced by our competitors.\nAs a result of our business model of employing our lead agents, our lead agents generally earn less on a per transaction basis than traditional agents who work as independent contractors at traditional brokerages. Because our model is uncommon in our industry, agents considering working for us may not understand our compensation model or may not perceive it to be more attractive than the independent contractor, commission-driven compensation model used by most traditional brokerages. If we\u2018re unable to attract, retain, effectively train, motivate, and utilize lead agents, we will be unable to grow our business and we may be required to significantly increase our lead agent compensation or other costs, which could harm our business.\nAlso as a result of employing our lead agents, we incur costs that our brokerage competitors do not, such as base pay, employee benefits, expense reimbursement, training, and employee transactional support staff. As a result, we have significant costs that, in the event of downturns in demand in the markets we serve, we will not be able to adjust as rapidly as some of our competitors. In turn, such downturns may impact us more than our competitors. Additionally, due to these costs, our lead agent turnover may be more costly to us than to traditional brokerages. Our business may be harmed if we are unable to achieve the necessary level of lead agent productivity and retention to offset their related costs.\nReferring customers to our partner agents or other third parties may harm our business.\nWe refer customers to third-party partner agents when we do not have a lead agent available due to high demand or geographic limitations. Our dependence on partner agents can be particularly heavy in certain new markets as we build our operations to scale in those markets. Our partner agents are independent licensed agents affiliated with other brokerages, and we do not have any control over their actions. If our partner agents were to provide diminished quality of customer service, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the laws and rules to which we are subject, we may be subject to legal claims and our reputation and business may be harmed.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into similar arrangements to refer consumers to other third parties when we are unable or unwilling to serve those consumers directly.\nOur arrangements with third parties may limit our growth and brand awareness. For example, referring customers to partner agents potentially redirects repeat and referral opportunities to the partner agents. Any third-party arrangements may also dilute the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and may\nlead to consumer confusion or dissatisfaction when they are offered the opportunity to work with the third party rather than us.\nIf we do not comply with the rules, terms of service, and policies of MLSs, our access to and use of listings data may be restricted or terminated.\nWe must comply with an MLS\u2019s rules, terms of service, and policies to access and use its listings data. We belong to numerous MLSs, and each has adopted its own rules, terms of service, and policies governing, among other things, how MLS data may be used and how listings data must be displayed on our website and mobile application. These rules typically do not contemplate multi-jurisdictional online brokerages like ours and vary widely among markets. They also are in some cases inconsistent with the rules of other MLSs such that we are required to customize our website, mobile application, or service to accommodate differences between MLS rules. Complying with the rules of each MLS requires significant investment, including personnel, technology and development resources, and the exercise of considerable judgment. If we are deemed to be noncompliant with an MLS\u2019s rules, we may face disciplinary sanctions in that MLS, which could include monetary fines, restricting or terminating our access to that MLS\u2019s data, or other disciplinary measures. The loss or degradation of this listings data could materially and adversely affect traffic to our website and mobile application, making us less relevant to consumers and restricting our ability to attract customers. It also could reduce agent and customer confidence in our services and harm our business.\nIf we fail to comply with the requirements governing the licensing of our brokerage, mortgage, and title businesses in the jurisdictions in which we operate, then our ability to operate those businesses in those jurisdictions may be revoked.\nRedfin, as a brokerage, and our agents are required to comply with the requirements governing the licensing and conduct of real estate brokerage and brokerage-related businesses in the markets where we operate. Furthermore, we are also required to comply with the mortgage broker and title insurance agency licenses in the states where we operate our mortgage and title businesses, respectively. Due to the geographic scope of our operations, we and our agents may not be in compliance with all of the required licenses at all times. Additionally, if we enter into new markets, we may become subject to additional licensing requirements. If we or our agents fail to obtain or maintain the required licenses for conducting our brokerage, mortgage, and title businesses or fail to strictly adhere to associated regulations, the relevant government authorities may order us to suspend relevant operations or impose fines or other penalties.\nOur decision to expand our service offerings into new markets may consume significant financial and other resources and may not achieve the desired results.\nWe regularly evaluate expanding our brokerage and non-brokerage services into new markets. Any expansion may require significant expenses and the time of our key personnel, particularly at the outset of the expansion process. Expansion may also subject us to new regulatory environments, which could increase our costs as we evaluate compliance with the new regulatory regime. Notwithstanding the expenses and time devoted to expansion into a new market, we may fail to achieve the financial and market share goals associated with the expansion.\nIn January 2019, we announced plans to expand our operations into Canada. Canada is the first market outside of the United States where we will operate. Accordingly, we have no experience operating our business in a foreign country and lack experience complying with the regulatory environment of a foreign country. With this expansion, our business will become impacted by the macroeconomic factors affecting the Canadian residential real estate industry, as well the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. There is no assurance that our Canadian expansion will achieve the desired results that our management expects.\nExpansion of our business to include non-brokerage services could fail to produce the desired results or harm our reputation.\nFrom time to time, we develop new services. Our current non-brokerage service offerings include Redfin Mortgage, our business of originating mortgage loans, Title Forward, our title and settlement business, and RedfinNow, our direct home purchase and resale business.\nWe have limited experience operating services outside of our brokerage business. Accordingly, we may not be able to operate any of our non-brokerage businesses at a profit. Our non-brokerage services may also fail to attract customers, reduce customer confidence in our brokerage business, undermine our customer-first reputation, create real or perceived conflicts of interest between us and our customers, expose us to increased market risks, or subject us to additional litigation.\nIn particular, in July 2018, we transitioned RedfinNow from an experimental offering to part of our long-term business. Our estimates of what a home is worth and the algorithm we use to inform those estimates may not be accurate and we may pay more for homes than their resale value. To determine whether a particular home meets our purchase criteria, we make a number of estimates, including the time of possession, market conditions and proceeds on resale, renovation costs, and holding costs. These estimates may not be accurate, especially in a declining real estate market. Additionally, unknown defects in any acquired homes may also affect their resale value. Furthermore, homes that we own might also suffer losses in value due to rapidly changing market conditions, natural disasters, or other forces outside our control. As a result, we may be required to write down the inventory value of homes and may not be able to resell homes for more than our costs of acquiring and renovating the homes, or at all.\nWe could be subject to significant losses if banks do not honor our escrow and trust deposits.\nThrough Title Forward, our title and settlement services business, we act as an escrow agent for numerous customers. As an escrow agent, we receive money from customers to hold until certain conditions are satisfied. Pending the satisfaction of the conditions, we deposit this money with various banks, but we remain contingently liable for the disposition of these deposits to the customer. The banks may hold a significant amount of these deposits in excess of the federal deposit insurance limit. If any of our depository banks were to become unable to honor any portion of our deposits when we require them for release to our customers, our customers could seek to hold us responsible for such amounts and, if the customers prevailed in their claims, we could be subject to significant losses.\nWe experience variability in our financial results and operating metrics on a quarterly and annual basis and, as a result, our historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.\nWe historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability, on both a quarterly and annual basis, in our financial results and operating metrics. As a result of such variability, our historical performance, including from recent quarters or years, may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance and period-to-period comparisons also may not be meaningful. The variability may be due to the other risks described in this Item 1A, certain risks that are not currently material but may become material in the future, or risks currently unknown to us.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business or result in the loss of critical and confidential information.\nCybersecurity incidents directed at us or our third-party service providers can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. Cybersecurity incidents are also constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party service providers collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our customers and employees, including personally identifiable information. Additionally, we rely on third-parties and their security procedures for the secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of information are\ncritical to our operations. Despite measures designed to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate cybersecurity incidents, such incidents may occur to us or our third-party providers and, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption, or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties, including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees) and the disruption of business operations. Any such compromises to our security, or that of our third-party providers, could cause customers to lose trust and confidence in us and stop using our website and mobile applications. In addition, we may incur significant costs for remediation that may include liability for stolen assets or information, repair of system damage, and compensation to customers, employees, and business partners. We may also be subject to government enforcement proceedings and legal claims by private parties.\nWe rely on third-party licensed technology, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels.\nWe employ certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies in our technology. Our reliance on this third-party software may become costly if the licensor increases the price for the license or changes the terms of use and we cannot find commercially reasonable alternatives. Even if we were to find an alternative, integration of our technology with new third-party software may require substantial investment of our time and resources.\nAny undetected errors or defects in the third-party software we license could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our technology, delay new service offerings, or result in a failure of our website or mobile application.\nWe use open source software in some aspects of our technology and may fail to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses.\nOur technology incorporates software covered by open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and if they were interpreted, such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated restrictions on our technology. If portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in our use of such software, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies.\nMoreover, our processes for controlling our use of open source software may not be effective. If we do not comply with the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our services on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our technology to remove or replace the open source software, to discontinue the use of certain technology if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, to pay monetary damages, to make generally available the source code for our proprietary technology, or to waive certain intellectual property rights.\nWe may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our technology and methodologies or adequately enforce our intellectual property rights.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our intellectual property. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and contractual provisions and restrictions. However, we may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our technology and methodologies or the steps we take to enforce our intellectual property rights may be inadequate.\nIf we are unable to secure intellectual property rights, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market offerings similar to ours and we would have no recourse to enjoin or stop their actions. Additionally, any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others and invalidated through\nadministrative processes or litigation. Moreover, even if we secured our intellectual property rights, others may infringe on our intellectual property and we may be unable to successfully enforce our rights against the infringers because we may be unaware of the infringement or our legal actions may not be successful. If any of these events were to occur, our ability to compete effectively would be impaired.\nThe third-party networks and mobile infrastructure that we depend on may fail, and we may be unable to maintain and scale the technology underlying our offerings.\nWe depend on the reliable performance of third-party networks and mobile infrastructure to provide our technology offerings to our customers and agents. The proper operation of these networks and infrastructure is beyond our control, and if they fail, we may be unable to deliver our services to our customers or provide the necessary support for our agents.\nAs the number of homebuyers and home sellers, agents, and listings shared on our website and mobile application and the extent and types of data grow, our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow. Operating our underlying technology systems is expensive and complex, and we could experience operational failures. If we experience interruptions or failures in these systems for any reason, the security and availability of our services and technologies could be affected.\nOur website is hosted at a single facility, the failure of which could interrupt our website and mobile application.\nOur website and mobile application are hosted at a single facility in Seattle, Washington. If this facility experiences outages or downtimes for any reason, including human error, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, physical or electronic break-ins, terrorist attack, or act of war, we could suffer a significant interruption of our website and mobile application while we implement the disaster recovery procedures we have developed to restore the function of our website and mobile application on a cloud-based hosting service. This service interruption may be extended if we discover previously unknown errors in our disaster recovery procedures.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, and our compliance with these laws, or the enforcement of our rights under these laws, may increase our expenses, require management's resources, or force us to change our business practices.\nWe are currently subject to a variety of, and may in the future become subject to additional, federal, state, and local laws. The laws include, but are not limited to, those relating to real estate, brokerage, title, mortgage, advertising, privacy and consumer protection, labor and employment, and intellectual property. These laws and their related regulations may evolve frequently and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. In some cases, it is unclear how certain laws may affect us based on our business model that is unlike traditional brokerages and the fact that those laws and regulations were created for traditional real estate brokerages.\nThese laws can be costly for us to comply with or enforce. Additionally, if we are unable to comply with and become liable for violations of these laws, or if courts or regulatory bodies provide unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations, our operations in affected markets may become prohibitively expensive, consume significant amounts of management's time, or need to be discontinued.\nData protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the United States at both the federal and state level. For example, the recently passed California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, to take effect on January 1, 2020 as currently enacted, is still in development and has the potential to impose additional onerous privacy requirements on companies serving California consumers, including us. We will need to carefully consider the compliance mandates of the California law as well as similar state or federal laws or interpretations currently being proposed. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The burdens imposed by the CCPA and other\nsimilar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditure to comply.\nWe are subject to costs associated with defending and resolving proceedings brought by government entities and claims brought by private parties.\nWe are from time to time involved in, and may in the future be subject to, government investigations or enforcement actions and third-party claims arising from the laws to which we are subject or the contracts to which we are a party. Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K describes some of these types of investigations, actions, and claims. Any such investigations, actions, or claims can be costly to defend or resolve, require significant time from management, or result in negative publicity. Furthermore, to the extent we are unsuccessful in defending an action or claim, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including significant fines or damages, the loss of ability to operate in a jurisdiction, or the need to change certain business practices (including redesigning, or obtaining a license for, our technology or modifying or ceasing to offer certain services).\nWe have, in the past, been the subject of complaints alleging that we had misclassified third-party licensed sales associates as independent contractors instead of employees. The complaints generally sought compensation for unpaid wages, overtime, and failure to provide meal and rest periods, as well as reimbursement of business expenses. While we settled these complaints, we may be subject to additional lawsuits or administrative proceedings claiming that certain of our independent contractor associate agents should be classified as our employees rather than as independent contractors. These lawsuits and proceedings typically seek substantial monetary damages (including claims for unpaid wages, overtime, and unreimbursed business expenses), injunctive relief, or both.\nWe have, in the past, been the subject of complaints alleging that we had improperly classified certain of our employees as exempt from minimum wage and overtime laws. The legal tests for determining overtime exemptions consider many factors that vary from state to state and have evolved based on case law, regulations, and legislative changes, as well as complicated factual analysis. We may be subject to additional complaints or administrative proceedings regarding our employee classification.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements.\nWe have established, and intend to maintain, effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. As a newly public company, we have not historically been required to maintain the effectiveness of these types of control systems. If we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, may be required to restate previously issued financial statements, or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial statements, even after we remedy the failure.\nSome of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage.\nWe maintain insurance to cover costs and losses from certain risk exposures in the ordinary course of our operations, but our insurance may not cover one hundred percent of the costs and losses from all events. We are responsible for certain retentions and deductibles that vary by policy, and we may suffer losses that exceed our insurance coverage limits by a material amount. We may also incur costs or suffer losses arising from events against which we have no insurance coverage. In addition, large-scale market trends or the occurrence of adverse events in our business may raise our cost of procuring insurance or limit the amount or type of insurance we are able to secure. We may not be able to maintain our current coverage, or obtain new coverage, in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Incurring uninsured or underinsured costs or losses could harm our business.\nWe intend to evaluate acquisitions or investments in third-party technologies and businesses, but we may not realize the anticipated benefits from, and may incur substantial costs related to, any acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, or investments that we undertake.\nAs part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate strategic opportunities, including acquisitions of or investment in third-party technologies and businesses. However, we may be unable to execute a strategic opportunity on a commercially reasonable basis or at all. To the extent we make an acquisition or investment, the transaction may not result in the intended benefits to our business or require us to record impairment charges associated with the acquisition. Furthermore, the process of integrating an acquired company, business, technology, or personnel into our company may subject us to additional costs and require substantial time from our management. Finally, we may assume liability for activities of the acquired company or business that existed prior to the acquisition but that did not become known until afterwards.\nWe depend on our senior management team to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain, manage, and motivate them, or if new members of our senior management team do not perform as we anticipate, our business may be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, manage, motivate, and retain members of our senior management team, particularly those who have specialized skills and experience in technology fields and the residential real estate industry. We do not have employment agreements with any employee, including our senior management team, and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any employee. Any changes in our senior management team may be disruptive to our business. If we fail to retain or effectively replace members of our senior management team, or if our senior management team fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nEvents unrelated to our performance may cause the trading price of our common stock to be volatile, and if such volatility results in litigation, then we may be subject to increased costs.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to events beyond our control and unrelated to our performance, including:\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the U.S. and global equity markets and the performance of the technology and real estate sectors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of technical innovations, new business offerings, or changes in pricing;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity related to our service offerings;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\npolitical uncertainty in the markets in which we operate, the threat or occurrence of war or terrorism, and acts of God.\nIf any such fluctuation causes our stock price to decrease, we may become subject to litigation as a result of the decreased price. If any litigation occurs, it could subject us to substantial costs, harm our reputation, and divert resources and the attention of management from our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, or if our financial results do not compare favorably to analysts' or investors' expectations, our stock price or trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our industry, and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or otherwise provide negative views of our stock, our stock price would likely decline. Additionally, if one or more of these analysts cease covering us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFurthermore, many analysts who cover us publish quarterly and annual estimates for certain of our financial metrics. We do not assist analysts in preparing these estimates and have no control over the expectations that they set through their estimates. If our actual quarterly and annual financial results do not compare favorably to analysts' or investors' expectations, then our stock price could decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that they might occur, may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may need to raise capital in the future by selling shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock. Additionally, our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders may also sell their holdings of our common stock, in accordance with securities laws and our policies. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by us or our insiders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware or Washington law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\npermit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws, unless the amendment is approved by two-thirds of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan, also known as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d;\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nMoreover, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Likewise, because our principal executive offices are located in Washington, the anti-takeover provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act may apply to us under certain circumstances. These provisions prohibit a \u201ctarget corporation\u201d from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any stockholder constituting an \u201cacquiring person\u201d for a period of five years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cacquiring person.\u201d\nAny of these provisions of our organizational documents or Delaware or Washington law could, under certain circumstances, depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the U.S. federal district courts as the sole and exclusive forums for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or the Court of Chancery, will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to personal and subject matter jurisdiction requirements.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation further provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the U.S. federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, subject to personal and subject matter jurisdiction requirements.\nThe foregoing choice of forum provisions may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders.\nAlternatively, if a court were to find these provisions inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or claims, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions. For example, a Delaware court recently ruled that exclusive forum provisions for claims under the Securities Act of 1933 are not enforceable as a matter of Delaware law and application of that ruling could result in such claims being litigated in one or more courts, including state courts.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness, Including Our Convertible Senior Notes\nConversion of our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of our convertible senior notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as\nthe case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing our convertible senior notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing our convertible senior notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, the indenture will require us to repurchase our convertible senior notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture) of us and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase our convertible senior notes and/or increase the conversion rate, which could make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in such takeover. Such additional costs may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nServicing our debt, including our convertible senior notes, will require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow to make payments on our debt, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our convertible senior notes or to repurchase our convertible senior notes upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including our senior convertible notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that may be beyond our control. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition and business performance at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, including our convertible senior notes or otherwise.\nIn addition, holders of our convertible senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon conversion of our convertible senior notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the notes surrendered therefor or at the time the notes are being converted. Our failure to repurchase our convertible senior notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes would constitute an event of default. If the repayment of any indebtedness were to be accelerated because of such event of default (whether under the notes or otherwise), we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. An event of default under the indenture may lead to an acceleration of our convertible senior notes. Any such acceleration could result in our bankruptcy. In a bankruptcy, the holders of our convertible senior notes would have a claim to our assets that is senior to the claims of our equity holders.\nIn addition, our significant indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to fund possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, products, services and technologies.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our convertible senior notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of our convertible senior notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash at the option of the issuer, such as our convertible senior notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results. In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20.\nUnder ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as our convertible senior notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for our convertible senior notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at issuance, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report lower net income or greater loss in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as our convertible senior notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash at the option of the issuer are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable or otherwise elect not to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nIn addition to our existing convertible senior notes, we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. For instance, we may enter into additional loans or sources of capital to finance the operations of properties. We will not be restricted under the terms of the indenture governing our convertible senior notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due.", "PERMNO": 16829, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "RDFN"}
