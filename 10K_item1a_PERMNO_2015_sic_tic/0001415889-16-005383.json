RISK FACTORS.\nOur business is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. These risks and uncertainties could also cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements that we make from time to time. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties of general applicability and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.\nWhen used herein, the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cEcho,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to Echo Therapeutics, Inc.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results, Financial Reporting and Need for Financing\nWe have a history of operating losses and we expect our operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future.\nWe have generated limited revenue and have had operating losses since inception, including a net loss of ($22,197,867) for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash of approximately $56,210 and an accumulated deficit of ($150,129,933). We have no current sources of material ongoing revenue, other than potential future milestone payments and royalties under our current license and collaboration agreements. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We also expect to have negative cash flows for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures. This will result in decreases in our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity, which may not be offset by future funding.\nIf we are not able to commercialize our product candidates, we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability, and even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase it on a quarterly or annual basis. We expect our operating losses to continue and increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to expend substantial resources to conduct research and development, seek to obtain regulatory approval for our continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM or CGM System), identify and secure collaborative partnerships, and manage and execute our obligations in current and possible future strategic collaborations.\nContinued operating losses would impair our ability to continue operations. We have operating and liquidity concerns due to our significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating sufficient cash flow to conduct operations or obtaining additional financing. Continuation as a going concern is dependent upon achieving profitable operations and positive operating cash flows sufficient to pay all obligations as they come due. Historically, we have had difficulty in meeting our cash requirements. Our failure to become and remain profitable may depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. There can be no assurances that we will obtain additional funding, reduce the level of historical losses and achieve successful commercialization of any of our product candidates. Any financing activity is likely to result in significant dilution to current stockholders.\nWe continue to require substantial amounts of capital, without which we will be unable to develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nOur development efforts to date have consumed and will continue to require substantial amounts of capital in connection with the research and development of our next generation CGM System. As we conduct more advanced development of our CGM System, we will need significant funding to complete our product development program and to pursue commercialization. Our ability to conduct our research, development and planned commercialization activities associated with our CGM System is highly dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient financing.\nThere are factors, a number of which are outside our control, that may accelerate our need for additional financing, including:\n\u00b7\nthe costs, timing and risks of delay of obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe expenses we incur in developing, selling and marketing our CGM;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nthe revenue generated by future sales of our CGM and any other future products that we may develop;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other development activities;\n\u00b7\nthe success of our research and development efforts;\n\u00b7\nthe emergence of competing or complementary technological developments;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u00b7\nthe acquisition of businesses, products and technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to access existing financing sources, if any; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with potential legal proceedings.\nWe expect to seek funding through public or private financings or from existing or new licensing and collaboration agreements; however, the market price of our common stock is highly volatile. Due to market conditions and the development status of our CGM, additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional financing or we are unable to access financing from existing or future financing sources in a timely fashion, we may not be able to meet our research, development and commercialization goals, which in turn would adversely affect our business.\nFailure to receive stockholder approval for share issuances related to a transaction or series of transactions where the common stock to be issued in the offering, or underlying convertible securities to be issued in the offering, will, upon issuance, equal or exceed 20 percent of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding before such issuance (see Nasdaq Rule 5635), could adversely affect our cash flows or otherwise cause our stock price to decline.\nUnder Rule 5635 of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, stockholder approval is generally required for situations covered by the \u201c20 percent rule,\u201d i.e., transactions (other than public offerings) involving:\n\u00b7\nthe sale or issuance (or potential issuance) by the company of stock (or securities convertible or exercisable for stock) at a price below the greater of book or market value, which together with sales by officers, directors or substantial stockholders, is at least 20 percent of the outstanding shares or at least 20 percent of the voting power prior to the issuance; or\n\u00b7\nthe sale or issuance (or potential issuance) of stock (or securities convertible or exercisable for stock) equal to 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares or voting power before the issuance for less than the greater of book or market value (see Nasdaq Rule 5635(d)).\nOn January 29, 2016, in connection with a Securities Purchase Agreement, we received net cash proceeds of $832,000 from a $5,145,000 financing through the issuance of 10% senior secured convertible notes and warrants. If stockholder approval for the balance of the offering pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 is not obtained, we will need to seek an alternative source of financing. We may not be able to secure such other financing on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain alternative necessary financing, we may be required to substantially reduce the scope of our operations.\nFailure to receive stockholder approval for the offering of notes and warrants pursuant to our January 29, 2016 Security Purchase Agreement will cause certain rights contained within the notes and warrants to be ineffective.\nCertain rights of the purchasers of notes and warrants in this offering are subject to the receipt of stockholder approval. Failure to obtain stockholder approval for the offering will cause certain rights contained within the notes and warrants to be ineffective and may adversely affect the value of an investment in the notes and warrants. Further, even if stockholder approval is obtained, certain rights contained within the notes will be inapplicable if a purchaser fails to fund the second tranche of the offering for which such purchaser committed.\nWe no longer comply with the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement or the requirement to hold an annual stockholders meeting for continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Failure to comply with the Nasdaq requirements may affect our ability to trade on the Nasdaq market, raise further working capital and continued operations could be adversely impacted.\nOn January 6, 2016, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) that, as a result of the Company\u2019s failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders no later than one year after the end of its fiscal year as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a), and the Company\u2019s failure to meet the minimum $2.5 million stockholders\u2019 equity requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), Nasdaq had determined to initiate procedures to delist the Company\u2019s securities from The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company was advised that, unless the Company requested an appeal of this determination, trading in the Company\u2019s common stock would be suspended at the opening of business on January 15, 2016 and a Form 25-NSE would be filed with the SEC to remove the Company\u2019s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The Company appealed Nasdaq\u2019s determination. The suspension of trading was stayed during the pendency of such appeal.\nOn March 9, 2016, the Company was informed that the Nasdaq Listing Panel (\u201cthe Panel\u201d) determined to grant our request to remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to the following conditions:\n\u00b7\nOn or before May 31, 2016, the Company shall have its Annual Shareholder Meeting for fiscal year ended 2015.\n\u00b7\nOn or before July 5, 2016, the Company shall publicly announce and inform the Panel that it has stockholders\u2019 equity above $2.5 million.\n\u00b7\nThe Company shall also, by that date, provide the Panel with updated projections demonstrating its ability to maintain its stockholders\u2019 equity above $2.5 million through June 30, 2017. These projections shall detail the underlying assumptions, including any required capital raises or conversions of debt or preferred to common stock. The Panel will consider at that time whether a Panel Monitor is appropriate.\nThe Company was advised that July 5, 2016 represents the full extent of the Panel\u2019s discretion to grant continued listing while it is non-compliant. Should the Company fail to demonstrate compliance with that rule by that date, the Panel will issue a final delist determination and the Company will be suspended from trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In order to fully comply with the terms of this exception, the Company must be able to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market. In the event the Company is unable to do so, its securities may be delisted from The Nasdaq Stock Market. It is a requirement during the exception period that the Company provide prompt notification of any significant events that occur during this time. This includes, but is not limited to, any event that may call into question the Company\u2019s historical financial information or that may impact the Company\u2019s ability to maintain compliance with any Nasdaq listing requirement or exception deadline. The Panel reserves the right to reconsider the terms of this exception based on any event, condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the Panel, make continued listing of the Company\u2019s securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market inadvisable or unwarranted. In addition, any compliance document will be subject to review by the Panel, which may, in its discretion, request additional information before determining that the Company has complied with the terms of the exception.\nThere can be no assurances whether the Company will be able to regain or maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. In the event of delisting, the Company expects that its stock would trade on the OTC Markets.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue and/or expense fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards or practices or in existing taxation rules or practices could have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practices have occurred and may occur in the future. The methods by which we intend to market and sell our product candidates, if commercialized, may have an impact on the manner in which we recognize revenue. In addition, changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Changes in taxation rules related to stock options and other forms of equity compensation could also have a significant negative effect on our reported results. Additionally, changes to accounting rules or standards, such as the potential requirement that U.S. registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, may adversely impact our reported financial results and business, and may further require us to incur greater accounting fees.\nValuation of share-based payments, which we are required to perform for purposes of recording compensation expense under authoritative guidance for share-based payments, involves significant assumptions that are subject to change and difficult to predict.\nWe record compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations for share-based payments, such as employee stock options, using the fair value method. The requirements of the authoritative guidance for share-based payments have had and will continue to have a material effect on our future financial results reported under GAAP and make it difficult for us to accurately predict the impact on our future financial results.\nFor instance, estimating the fair value of share-based payments is highly dependent on assumptions regarding the future exercise behavior of our employees and changes in our stock price. Our share-based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and changes to the subjective input assumptions of our share-based payment valuation models can materially change our estimates of the fair values of our share-based payments. In addition, the actual values realized upon the exercise, expiration, early termination or forfeiture of share-based payments might be significantly different than our estimates of the fair values of those awards as determined at the date of grant. Moreover, we rely on third parties that supply us with information or help us perform certain calculations that we employ to estimate the fair value of share-based payments. If any of these parties do not perform as expected or make errors, we may inaccurately calculate actual or estimated compensation expense for share-based payments.\nThe authoritative guidance for share-based payments could also adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future financial results as assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value of share-based payments are based on estimates and judgments that may differ from period to period. We may also be unable to accurately predict the amount and timing of the recognition of tax benefits associated with share-based payments as they are highly dependent on the exercise behavior of our employees and the price of our stock relative to the exercise price of each outstanding stock option.\nFor those reasons, among others, the authoritative guidance for share-based payments may create variability and uncertainty in the share-based compensation expense we will record in future periods, which could adversely impact our financial results and, in turn, our stock price and increase our expected stock price volatility as compared to prior periods.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, which could adversely affect our stock price and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting, and our management is required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. As of December 31, 2015, we concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses have been identified and included in management\u2019s assessment.\nWhile we are committed to remediating the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weaknesses, there can be no assurances that our remediation efforts will be successful or that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies (including material weaknesses) from happening that could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause our consolidated financial results to contain material misstatements, cause the market price of our common stock to decline, damage our reputation or have other potential material adverse consequences.\nRisks Related to Our Operations, Business Strategy and Development of Our Product Candidates\nOur CGM may not be successfully developed or achieve market acceptance.\nWe have evaluated our CGM System in a clinical setting for the continuous monitoring of glucose. The future development of the next generation CGM System will require substantial expenditures, including additional product development, feasibility studies, preclinical studies and clinical testing. Projected costs of this development are difficult to estimate, and they may change and increase frequently.\nOur success is also dependent on further developing new and existing products and obtaining favorable results from preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as satisfying regulatory standards and approvals required for the market introduction of our product candidates. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter unforeseen problems in the development of our CGM, or that we will be able to successfully address problems that do arise. There can be no assurance that any of our potential products will be successfully developed, be proven safe and efficacious in clinical trials, meet applicable regulatory standards, be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs, or be eligible for third-party reimbursement from governmental or private insurers. Even if we successfully develop new products, there can be no assurance that those products will be successfully marketed or achieve market acceptance, or that expected markets will develop for such products. The degree of market acceptance will depend in part on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nestablish and demonstrate the clinical efficacy and safety of our current product candidates and any other product candidates we may develop;\n\u00b7\ncreate products that are superior to alternatives currently on the market; and\n\u00b7\nestablish the potential advantage of our product candidates over alternative available products.\nIn addition, because our product candidates are based on new technologies, they may be subject to lengthy sales cycles and may take substantial time and effort to achieve market acceptance. If any of our development programs are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals or clearances are not obtained, or potential products for which approvals or clearances are obtained are not commercially successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur success will depend on our ability to attract and retain our key personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management team and the senior members of our product development team. Our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to continue development of our CGM and operate our business, including senior management, scientists, clinicians, engineers and other highly-skilled personnel. Competition for senior management personnel, as well as scientists, clinicians and engineers, is intense, and we may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of members of our senior management team, scientists, clinicians or engineers could prevent the implementation and completion of our objectives, including the completion of development and commercialization of our CGM. The loss of a member of our senior management team or our professional staff would require the remaining executive officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement. Each of our officers may terminate their employment at any time without notice and without cause or good reason. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees.\nWe rely on third parties to develop, commercialize and manufacture our CGM.\nWe depend on collaborators, partners, licensees, contract research organizations, manufacturers and other third parties to support our efforts to develop and commercialize our CGM, to manufacture prototypes and clinical and commercial scale quantities of our CGM and we expect to rely on such third parties to market, sell and distribute any products we successfully develop.\nWe rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and other third parties to manage the trials and to perform related data collection and analysis; however, we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that clinical sites may devote to our clinical trials. If these clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials, fail to ensure compliance by patients with clinical protocols or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we will be unable to successfully complete these trials, which could prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals for our CGM. Our agreements with clinical investigators and clinical sites for clinical testing place substantial responsibilities on these parties and, if these parties fail to perform as expected, our trials could be delayed or terminated. If these clinical investigators, clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, or the clinical data may be rejected by the applicable regulatory authorities, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our CGM.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully negotiate agreements for, or maintain relationships with, collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical investigators, manufacturers and other third parties on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these agreements, we may not be able to clinically develop, formulate, manufacture, obtain regulatory approvals for or commercialize our CGM, which will in turn adversely affect our business. We expect to expend substantial management time and effort to enter into relationships with third parties and, if we successfully enter into such relationships, to manage these relationships. In addition, substantial amounts of our expenditures may be paid to third parties in these relationships. We cannot control the amount or timing of resources our contract partners will devote to our research and development programs, product candidates or potential product candidates, and we cannot guarantee that these parties will fulfill their obligations to us under these arrangements in a timely fashion, if at all. In addition, our contract partners may abandon research projects and terminate applicable agreements prior to or upon the expiration of agreed-upon contract terms.\nDisputes under key agreements or conflicts of interest with our scientific advisors, clinical investigators or other third-party collaborators could delay or prevent development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nAny agreements we have or may enter into with third parties, such as collaborators, licensees, suppliers, manufacturers, clinical research organizations, clinical investigators or clinical trial sites, may give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. Disagreements could develop over rights to ownership or use of intellectual property, the scope and direction of research and development, the approach for regulatory approvals or commercialization strategy. We intend to conduct research programs in a range of therapeutic areas, but our pursuit of these opportunities could result in conflicts with the other parties to these agreements that may be developing or selling products or conducting other activities in the same therapeutic areas. Any disputes or commercial conflicts could lead to the termination of our agreements, delay progress of our product development programs, compromise our ability to renew agreements or obtain future agreements, lead to the loss of intellectual property rights or result in costly litigation.\nWe collaborate with outside scientific advisors and collaborators at academic and other institutions that assist us in our research and development efforts. Our scientific advisors and collaborators are not our employees and may have other commitments that limit their availability to us. If a conflict of interest between their work for us and their work for another entity arises, we may lose their services and have difficulty in developing relationships with alternative scientific advisors and collaborators.\nIf future clinical studies or other articles are published, or diabetes or other medical associations announce positions that are unfavorable to our CGM, our efforts to obtain additional capital and our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our CGM may be negatively affected.\nFuture clinical studies or other articles regarding our CGM or any competing products may be published that either support a claim, or are perceived to support a claim, that a competitor\u2019s product is clinically more effective or easier to use than our CGM, or that our product candidates are not as effective or easy to use as we claim. Additionally, diabetes or other medical associations that may be viewed as authoritative could endorse products or methods that compete with our CGM or otherwise announce positions that are unfavorable to our CGM. Any of these events may negatively affect our efforts to obtain additional capital and our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our CGM, which would result in a delay in our ability to obtain revenue from sales of our CGM.\nIn one aspect of our business we operate in the highly competitive medical device market and face competition from large, well-established companies with significantly more resources and, as a result, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe industry in which we operate is extremely competitive. Many companies, universities and research organizations developing competing product candidates have greater resources and significantly greater experience in financial, research and development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution and regulatory matters than we have. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Our competitors could commence and complete clinical testing of their product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals, and begin commercial-scale manufacturing of their products faster than we are able to for our CGM. They could develop products that would render our CGM obsolete and noncompetitive. Our competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies, we may not be able to commercialize our CGM effectively or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\nThe market for glucose monitoring devices is particularly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Several companies are developing or currently marketing continuous glucose monitoring products for people with diabetes in the outpatient setting that will compete directly with our CGM. To date, Abbott Laboratories, DexCom, Inc., and Medtronic, Inc. have received FDA and CE Mark approvals for their continuous glucose monitors for people with diabetes. Roche Diagnostics U.S. and Senseonics are among those companies also developing CGM systems for people with diabetes in the outpatient setting. Many of the companies developing or marketing competing glucose monitoring devices enjoy several competitive advantages, including:\n\u00b7\ngreater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation;\n\u00b7\nsignificantly greater name recognition;\n\u00b7\nestablished relationships with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nestablished distribution networks;\n\u00b7\nadditional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and\n\u00b7\ngreater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for products and marketing approved products.\nAs a result, we may not be able to compete effectively against these companies or their products, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may have significant product liability exposure, which may harm our business and our reputation.\nWe may face exposure to product liability and other claims if our CGM is alleged to have caused harm. Although we expect to obtain product liability insurance when we begin marketing our product, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost, if at all. Our inability to obtain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of any products or product candidates that we develop. If we are sued for any injury caused by our products, product candidates or processes, our liability could exceed our product liability insurance coverage and our total assets. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or potential outcome, would divert management resources and may also generate negative publicity or hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of our products or expand our business.\nOur inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.\nOur success and ability to compete are dependent, in part, upon our ability to establish and maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark law, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property; however, such methods may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. Our patent applications may not issue as patents in a form that will be advantageous to us, or at all. Our issued patents, and those that may issue in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing products that are similar to our product candidates.\nWe may in the future need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property. The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of the litigation. In the event of an adverse judgment, a court could hold that some or all of our asserted intellectual property rights are not infringed, or are invalid or unenforceable, and could award attorney fees to the other party. Despite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so, or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. Additionally, third parties may be able to design around our patents. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from commercializing our product candidates, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.\nAs is generally the case in the medical device industry in which we operate, third parties may, in the future, assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to our current product candidates or any future products that we may develop. Whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain; therefore, we cannot be certain that we will not be found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties or others. Our competitors may assert that they hold U.S. or foreign patents that cover our product candidates, technologies and/or the methods we employ in the use of our CGM. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that there are numerous issued patents and pending patent applications relating to self-monitored glucose testing systems. Because patent applications may take years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products infringe. There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more components of our system may inadvertently infringe. As the number of competitors in the market for continuous glucose monitoring and drug delivery systems grows, the possibility of inadvertent patent infringement by us, or a patent infringement claim against us, increases.\nAny infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management\u2019s attention from our business and harm our reputation. If the relevant patents were upheld as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from selling our product that is found to infringe unless we obtain the right to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent. We may be unable to obtain such rights on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement.\nEven if we are able to redesign our products to avoid an infringement claim, we may not receive regulatory authority approval for such changes in a timely manner or at all. A court could also order us to pay compensatory damages and prejudgment interest for the infringement and could, in addition, treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees. These damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. A court also could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoin us and our customers from making, using, selling or offering to sell our products, or could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities. Depending on the nature of the relief ordered by the court, we could become liable for additional damages to third parties.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approvals and Government Regulation\nFor one aspect of our business if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to market our CGM, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe cannot market any product candidate until we have completed all necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and have obtained the necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA. Outside the United States, our ability to market any of our potential products is dependent upon receiving marketing approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities. These foreign regulatory approval processes include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval or CE Marking process. If we are unable to receive regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates, and we may need to cease or curtail our operations.\nFor one aspect of our business the regulatory approval process is costly and lengthy and we may not be able to successfully obtain all required regulatory approvals.\nThe preclinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing and labeling of medical devices are all subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities and agencies in the United States and other countries. We or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval for our CGM before marketing or selling it. It is not possible to predict how long the approval processes of the FDA or any other applicable federal or foreign regulatory authority or agency for any of our products will take or whether any such approvals ultimately will be granted. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in the medical device approval process, and positive results in preclinical testing or early phases of clinical studies offer no assurance of success in later phases of the approval process. Generally, preclinical and clinical testing of products can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if we obtain the necessary preclinical, clinical, and other data, regulatory approval applications are complex and extensive submissions that require significant time, resources, and expertise to put together. If we encounter significant delays in the regulatory process that result in excessive costs, it may prevent us from continuing to develop our CGM. Any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, approvals would adversely affect the marketing of our CGM and our ability to generate product revenue. The risks associated with the approval process include:\n\u00b7\nfailure of our CGM to meet a regulatory entity\u2019s requirements for safety, efficacy and quality;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the indicated uses for which our CGM may be marketed;\n\u00b7\nimposition of post-market clinical studies or other post-market requirements;\n\u00b7\npre-approval inspections of our clinical trial data may uncover problems with the conduct of the clinical trials or the resulting data;\n\u00b7\npreapproval inspections of our contract manufacturing facilities may require us to undertake corrective actions;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen safety issues or side effects;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements and guidelines; and\n\u00b7\npost-marketing surveillance and studies.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete the preclinical studies or clinical trials necessary to support an application for regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize our CGM, which could impair our financial position.\nBefore submitting an application for regulatory approval for our products, we or our collaborators must successfully complete preclinical studies and clinical trials that we believe will demonstrate that our product is safe and effective for its intended use. Product development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a long, expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays and failure at any stage. Furthermore, the data obtained from the studies and trials may be inadequate to support approval of an application for regulatory approval. With respect to our medical device programs, we must obtain an Investigational Device Exemption (\u201cIDE\u201d) prior to commencing additional clinical trials for our CGM. FDA approval of an IDE application permitting us to conduct testing does not mean that the FDA will consider the data gathered in the trial to be sufficient to support regulatory approval, even if the trial\u2019s intended safety and efficacy endpoints are achieved.\nIn addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials of our products that vary from country to country.\nThe commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support regulatory approval for numerous reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u00b7\npatients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we expect;\n\u00b7\npatients do not comply with trial protocols;\n\u00b7\npatient follow-up is not at the rate we expect;\n\u00b7\npatients experience adverse side effects;\n\u00b7\npatients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to treatment using our product candidates;\n\u00b7\ninstitutional review boards (\u201cIRBs\u201d) and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject our trial protocols;\n\u00b7\nthird-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the investigator agreements, clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA, foreign regulatory authority or IRB requirements;\n\u00b7\nthird-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans;\n\u00b7\nregulatory inspections of our clinical trials or contract manufacturing facilities may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions;\n\u00b7\nthe interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; and\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or foreign regulatory authority concludes that our trial design, conduct or results are inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.\nThe results of preclinical studies do not necessarily predict future clinical trial results, and predecessor clinical trial results may not be repeated in subsequent clinical trials. Additionally, the FDA or foreign regulatory authority may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If the FDA or foreign regulatory authority concludes that the clinical trial design, conduct or results are inadequate to prove safety and efficacy, it may require us to pursue additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, which could further delay the approval of our products. If we are unable to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in our clinical trials, we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval to market our products. The data we collect from our current clinical trials, our preclinical studies and other clinical trials may not be sufficient to support FDA or foreign regulatory authority approval.\nIf we, our contract manufacturers, or our component suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations, the manufacturing and distribution of our products could be interrupted, and our operating results could suffer.\nWe, our contract manufacturers and our component suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s and foreign regulatory authority\u2019s quality system regulations, as applicable, which is a complex regulatory framework that covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. For our products that require FDA premarket approval prior to marketing, a successful preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility will be required. For marketed products, the regulatory authorities enforce their quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections. We cannot assure anyone that our facilities or our contract manufacturers\u2019 or component suppliers\u2019 facilities would pass any future quality system inspection. If our or any of our contract manufacturers\u2019 or component suppliers\u2019 facilities fails a quality system inspection, the approval of our product candidates could be delayed and/or the manufacturing or distribution of marketed products could be interrupted and our operations disrupted. Failure to take adequate and timely corrective action in response to an adverse quality system inspection could force a suspension or shutdown of our packaging and labeling operations or the manufacturing operations of our contract manufacturers, or a recall of our products. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to provide our customers with the products they require on a timely basis, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers, any or all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products could be subject to recall, cessation of marketing, or other corrective action even if we receive regulatory clearance or approval, which would harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require a product recall, cessation of marketing, or other corrective action if we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with relevant regulations pertaining to manufacturing practices, labeling, advertising or promotional activities, or if new information is obtained concerning the safety or efficacy of these products. A government-mandated recall, cessation of marketing, or other corrective action could occur if the regulatory authority finds that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death. A voluntary recall, cessation of marketing, or other corrective action by us could occur as a result of manufacturing defects, labeling deficiencies, packaging defects or other failures to comply with applicable regulations. Any recall, cessation of marketing, or other corrective action would divert management attention and financial resources, harm our reputation with customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nThe healthcare and related industries are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to:\n\u00b7\nbilling for services;\n\u00b7\nfinancial relationships with physicians and other referral sources;\n\u00b7\ninducements and courtesies given to physicians and other health care providers and patients;\n\u00b7\nlabeling products;\n\u00b7\nquality of medical equipment and services;\n\u00b7\nconfidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with medical records and individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nmedical device reporting;\n\u00b7\nfalse claims; and\n\u00b7\nprofessional licensure.\nThese laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in some cases, still evolving. In many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations that govern our activities, we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines or curtailment of our operations. The risk of being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business.\nIn addition, healthcare laws and regulations may change significantly in the future. Any new healthcare laws or regulations may adversely affect our business. A review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities may result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations. Also, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts or adversely impacts our operations.\nWe are not aware of any governmental healthcare investigations involving our executives or us; however, any future healthcare investigations of our executives, our managers or us could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as adverse publicity.\nIf we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nThere are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as supplemented by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy rules under HIPAA, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a public company, we are required to incur substantial expenses.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, review, audit, and public reporting of our financial results, business activities, and other matters. SEC regulations, including regulations enacted as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, have also substantially increased the accounting, legal, and other costs related to compliance with SEC reporting obligations. If we do not have current information about our Company available to market makers, they will not be able to trade our stock. The public company costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, and other information with the SEC will cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we were privately-held. These increased costs may be material and may include the hiring of additional employees and/or the retention of additional advisors and professionals. Our failure to comply with the federal securities laws could result in private or governmental legal action against us and/or our officers and directors, which could have a detrimental effect on our business and finances, the value of our stock, and the ability of stockholders to resell their stock.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over our affairs.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders hold at least 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock and, assuming the exercise and conversion of all currently outstanding exercisable and convertible securities, own approximately 40% of our outstanding capital stock on an as-converted basis. Accordingly, these stockholders may continue to have significant influence over our affairs. Additionally, this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, because an investor could perceive disadvantages in owning stock of a company with a concentration of ownership. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control.\nSubstantial sales of shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to issue equity securities in the future.\nIf stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, or the market perceives that any such sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur stock price is volatile and may fluctuate in the future, and stockholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which we cannot control. For example, between June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, our common stock has closed between a low price of $1.29 and a high price of $1.88. Among the factors that could cause material fluctuations in the market price for our common stock are:\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully raise capital to fund our continued operations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to license and/or sell our assets, including Intellectual Property;\n\u00b7\npotential necessity of Echo to seek out and/or receive the protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code;\n\u00b7\nour financial condition, performance and prospects;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the regulatory status of our CGM;\n\u00b7\nthe success or failure of the development and clinical testing of our CGM;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully raise capital to fund our continued operations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enter into and maintain successful collaborative arrangements with strategic partners for research and development, clinical testing, and sales and marketing;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nour ability to avoid delisting of the Common Stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market;\n\u00b7\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u00b7\nsales of large blocks of our common stock by officers, directors or significant stockholders;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or product development timelines;\n\u00b7\ngeneral financial and other market conditions and trading volumes of similar companies; and\n\u00b7\ndomestic and international economic conditions.\nThe broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, fluctuations in our stock price may make our stock attractive to momentum traders, hedge funds or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, or for a change in the composition of our Board or management to occur, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\ndividing our Board into three classes, only one of which is elected at each annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our Board. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe have never paid dividends and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future and, as a result, our investors\u2019 sole source of gain, if any, will depend on capital appreciation, if any.\nWe do not intend to declare any dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future and currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth. As a result, investors should not rely on an investment in our securities if they require the investment to produce dividend income. Capital appreciation, if any, of our shares may be investors\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Moreover, investors may not be able to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid for them.\nCompliance with regulations relating to public company corporate governance matters and reporting is time-consuming and expensive.\nThe laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and rules adopted or proposed by the SEC, have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased costs to us as we evaluate the implications of any new rules and regulations and respond to new requirements under such rules and regulations. We are required to comply with many of these rules and regulations, and will be required to comply with additional rules and regulations in the future. As a pre-commercialization stage company with limited capital and personnel, we will need to divert management\u2019s time and attention away from our business in order to ensure compliance with these regulatory requirements.\nOur outstanding options, warrants and preferred stock and the availability for resale of the underlying shares may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and cause substantial dilution.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were outstanding stock options to purchase 1,667,233 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of 2.01 per share, outstanding warrants to purchase 4,530,428 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $3.68 per share, and preferred stock convertible into 7,224,793 shares of common stock. Our outstanding options, warrants and preferred stock could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or engage in certain mergers or other transactions, since the holders of options, warrants and preferred stock can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we may be able to obtain additional capital through a new offering of securities on terms more favorable to us than the terms of outstanding options, warrants and preferred stock. For the life of the options, warrants and preferred stock, the holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nIf we issue additional shares in the future, it will likely result in the dilution of our existing stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 150,000,000 shares of Common Stock and up to 40,000,000 Preferred Shares, each with a par value of $0.01, of which 11,124,496 Common Shares and 8,025,793 Convertible Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2015.\nThe sale, exchange or issuance of a significant number of additional shares may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of the outstanding shares of our Common or Convertible Preferred Stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change in control of our Company. Lastly, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to investors, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nThe amendment of the conversion ratio with respect to our Series F Convertible Preferred Stock may result in the issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock.\nPursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement we entered into on January 29, 2016 (2016SPA), the Company is seeking stockholder approval to amend the Company\u2019s Certificate of Designations governing the Series F Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries F\u201d), which will, among other items, amend the Company\u2019s Certificate of Designations governing the Series F, which is required pursuant to the Consent, Waiver and Amendment Agreement (the \u201cConsent and Waiver Agreement\u201d) between the Company and the holders of the Series F. The Consent and Waiver Agreement waived certain registration rights that the holders of the Series F had with respect to such stock, in exchange for the amendment to the Company\u2019s Certificate of Designations governing the Series F which will, among other things, grant the holders of the Series F comparable anti-dilution and price reset provisions to the secured convertible notes issued pursuant to the 2016SPA. The holders of the Series F will be entitled to an adjustment in the conversion ratio in the event that the Company issues Common Stock (or Common Stock equivalents) for consideration of less than $1.50 a share. In addition, in the event that the closing price per share of the Common Stock is less than $1.50 for ten or more days during the 90 days immediately following the first effective date of a registration statement filed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the conversion ratio of the Series F will be adjusted from its current 1:1 ratio to one determined by dividing (i) $1.50 by (ii) 80% of the average of such ten lowest closing prices less than $1.50, subject to a floor of $.80.\nThis amendment of the Certificate of Designations may result in additional shares of our Common Stock being issuable above the number of shares that would have otherwise been issuance pursuant to the Certificate of Designations prior to such amendment.\nOur ability to realize potential value from our Net Operating Loss carryforwards is highly speculative and subject to numerous material uncertainties.\nOur Net Operating Loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards permit us the opportunity to offset net operating losses from prior years to taxable income in future years in order to reduce our tax liability. As we have incurred losses since our inception and do not currently expect to turn a profit in the near future, we are currently unable to realize value from our net operating loss carryforwards unless we generate future taxable income, either through the acquisition of a profitable company or otherwise. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income, if any, in future years to use the net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. The Internal Revenue Service could challenge the amount of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nIn order to preserve our NOL carryforwards, we must ensure that there has not been a \u201cchange of control\u201d of our Company. A \u201cchange of control\u201d includes a more than 50 percentage point increase in the ownership of our company by certain equity holders who are defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code as \u201c5 percent shareholders\u201d. Calculating whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity of Section 382 of the Code and because of limitations on a publicly-traded company\u2019s knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, the calculation of the amount of our NOL carryforwards may be changed as a result of a challenge by a governmental authority or our learning of new information about the ownership of, and transactions in, our securities. Our ability to fully utilize our NOL could be limited if there have been past ownership changes or if there are future ownership changes resulting in a change of control for Code Section 382. Additionally, future changes in tax legislation could negatively affect our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our net operating losses. Therefore, we can provide no assurance that a change in ownership of Echo would allow for the transfer of our existing NOL\u2019s to the surviving entity.", "PERMNO": 85572, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "ECTE"}
