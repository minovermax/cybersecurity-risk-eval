Risk Factors\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results:\n\u2022\nWe will require substantial additional financing in order to meet our business objectives;\n\u2022\nWe expect to continue to incur losses;\n\u2022\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited;\n\u2022\nWe currently do not generate significant revenue from product sales and may never become profitable, or, if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it;\n\u2022\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a \"going concern\";\n\u2022\nA failure to cure any alleged default under the Loan and Security Agreement, which allows the lender to take action, could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nOur growth strategy may require us to secure significant additional capital, the amount of which will depend upon the size, timing, and structure of future acquisitions or vertical integrations and our working capital and general corporate needs.\n\u2022\nWe are currently pursuing five clinical stage development product candidates, and our business is dependent on the success of all or any of such product candidates;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to successfully and timely develop our products;\n\u2022\nOur collaborative relationships with third parties could cause us to expend significant resources and incur substantial business risk with no assurance of financial return;\n\u2022\nWe will not be able to commercialize our product candidates if our preclinical development efforts are not successful, our clinical trials do not demonstrate safety or our clinical trials or pivotal animal studies do not demonstrate efficacy;\n\u2022\nInterim, top-line and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data becomes available and is subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data;\n\u2022\nPanacela and GPI have significant non-controlling interest holders and, as such, each may not be operated solely for our benefit;\n\u2022\nIf parties on whom we rely to manufacture our product candidates do not manufacture them in satisfactory quality, in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities, or at an acceptable cost, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed;\n\u2022\nIf the market opportunities for our products are smaller than we expected, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner or at all and the results of future clinical trials and pivotal efficacy studies may not be favorable;\n\u2022\nEnrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside of our control;\n\u2022\nCompensatory arrangements with our scientific advisors or consultants could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and ultimately lead to the delay or denial of marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions could prevent us from marketing our products abroad;\n\u2022\nThe Fast Track designation for entolimod may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process;\n\u2022\nWe may seek Breakthrough Therapy Designation for some of our product candidates. The designation may not be granted and, even if granted by the FDA, such designation may not lead to a faster development of any product candidate or approval process for any product candidate;\n\u2022\nIf the FDA does not conclude that certain of our product candidates satisfy the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for such product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as expected, the approval pathway for those product candidates will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in either case may not be successful;\n\u2022\nThe pre-EUA submission we made to the FDA in 2015 may not be successful and, even if such submission is successful, it may not accelerate BLA approval of entolimod or result in any purchase by the U.S. government for this product;\n\u2022\nEven if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, we will be subject to ongoing government regulation;\n\u2022\nIf physicians and patients do not accept and use our drugs, we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer;\n\u2022\nRecently enacted legislation, future legislation and healthcare reform measures may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval for and commercialize our product candidates and may affect the prices we may set for such products;\n\u2022\nWe are subject to various foreign, federal, and state healthcare and privacy laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022\nWe are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nWe rely on licensed patents to protect our technology. We may be unable to obtain or protect such intellectual property rights and we may be liable for infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our license agreements with third parties, we could lose our ability to develop our product candidates;\n\u2022\nWe depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties, and our licensors may not always act in our best interest;\n\u2022\nIf we are not able to protect and control our unpatented trade secrets, know-how and other technology, we may suffer competitive harm;\n\u2022\nChanges in patent law in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates;\n\u2022\nThe biopharmaceutical market in which we compete is highly competitive;\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans;\n\u2022\nOur growth could be limited if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants;\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees or our consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers;\n\u2022\nOur former laboratories used, and our subtenants use, certain chemical and biological agents and compounds that may be deemed hazardous and we are subject to various safety and environmental laws and regulations. Our compliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant costs, which could materially reduce our ability to become profitable;\n\u2022\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our information systems from cyberattacks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including personal data, damage to our reputation, and subject it to significant financial and legal exposure;\n\u2022\nPolitical or social factors may delay or impair our ability to market our products;\n\u2022\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences;\n\u2022\nThe recent resignation of our independent accounting firm could delay our future SEC filings and adversely affect our business;\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting standards, especially those that relate to management estimates and assumptions, are unpredictable and subject to interpretation by management and our independent registered public accounting firm and may materially impact how we report and record our financial condition;\n\u2022\nWe have experienced transitions in our management team, our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm in the past and may continue to do so in the future, which could result in disruptions in our operations and harm our business;\n\u2022\nPolitical, economic and governmental instability in Russia and Russian military action in the Ukraine could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results;\n\u2022\nThe legal system in Russia can create an uncertain environment for business activity, which could materially adversely affect our business and operations in Russia;\n\u2022\nActions by the tax authorities in Russia may result in the sudden imposition of arbitrary or onerous taxes on our operations in Russia;\n\u2022\nSelective or arbitrary government action may have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\nShareholder liability under Russian legislation could cause us to become liable for the obligations of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nOur Russian operating entities can be forced into liquidation on the basis of formal noncompliance with certain legal requirements;\n\u2022\nCrime and corruption could disrupt our ability to conduct our business;\n\u2022\nOur largest stockholder has the potential to significantly influence our business, which may be disadvantageous to other stockholders;\n\u2022\nThe price of our common stock has been and could remain volatile, which may in turn expose us to securities litigation;\n\u2022\nWe have, in the past failed, and currently fail to satisfy certain continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and could fail to satisfy these requirements again in the future. Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock;\n\u2022\nIf our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq and the price of our common stock remains below $5.00 per share, our common stock would come within the definition of \"penny stock\";\n\u2022\nIssuance of additional equity may adversely affect the market price of our stock;\n\u2022\nThe eventual public resale by certain of our significant stockholders could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future;\n\u2022\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline; and\n\u2022\nOur operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond our control.\nRisks Relating to our Financial Position and Need for Additional Financing\nWe will require substantial additional financing in order to meet our business objectives.\nSince our inception, most of our resources have been dedicated to preclinical and clinical research and development (\"R&D\") of our product candidates. In particular, we are currently developing several product candidates, including entolimod and in our STAT-200 and STAT-400 AIMS programs: STAT-201, STAT-205 and STAT-401, and intend to pursue additional product candidates in the future, including STAT-202, STAT-203 and STAT-204, each of which will require substantial funds to complete. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in the development of these product candidates. These expenditures will include costs associated with preclinical and clinical R&D, obtaining regulatory approvals, product manufacturing, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling for approved products. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. As of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments amounted to approximately $2.0 million.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. The net cash used for operating activities was $30.2 million and $5.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with ongoing activities, particularly as we conduct planned clinical trials for entolimod and our STAT-200 and STAT-400 AIMS programs, continue research and development and initiate clinical trials of other development programs and seek regulatory approval for current product candidates and any future product candidates we may develop.\nIn addition, as our product candidates progress through development and toward commercialization, we will need to make milestone payments to the licensors and other third parties from whom we have in-licensed or acquired our product candidates. Furthermore, if and to the extent we seek to acquire or in-license additional product candidates in the future, we may be required to make significant upfront payments, milestone payments, and/or licensing payments.\nBecause the outcome and timing of our planned and anticipated clinical trials is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts of capital necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results, and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials;\n\u2022 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates including the possibility that applicable regulators may require that us to perform more studies than those that are currently expected;\n\u2022\nthe cost of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that are approved for sale, including marketing, sales, and distribution costs;\n\u2022 the cost of manufacturing our product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;\n\u2022\nthe timing, receipt, and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any; and\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of product candidates that we may in-license and develop.\nWhen our available cash and cash equivalents become insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, or if and when we identify additional opportunities to do so, we will likely seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock or through additional credit facilities, these securities and/or the loans under credit facilities could provide for rights senior to those of our common stockholders and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Furthermore, any funds raised through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties may require us to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. In any such event, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.\nWe may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts and additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 and recent events, including the Russian military action in the Ukraine and the response by the United States and other countries, have significantly disrupted world financial markets, negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to seek out additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. On March 25, 2022, we received a letter from our principal secured lender in which such lender alleged that we were in default of our obligations under the loan agreement with such lender. As a result, the lender foreclosed on $4.8 million of our cash previously held in a bank account subject to a control agreement in favor of the lender, leaving us with little operating cash. If we fail to raise sufficient additional financing, on terms and dates acceptable to us, we may not be able to continue our operations and the development of our product candidates, our patent licenses may be terminated, we may be required to reduce staff, reduce or eliminate research and development, slow the development of our product candidates, outsource or eliminate several business functions or shut down operations or seek the protection of federal insolvency laws.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses.\nWe have incurred significant losses to date. We reported net losses of approximately $106.8 million and $12.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $134.45 million. Substantially all of our operating losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect significant losses to continue for the next few years as we spend substantial sums on the continued R&D of our proprietary product candidates, and there is no certainty that we will ever become profitable as a result of these expenditures. Even if any of our product candidates are approved, sales and marketing activities in connection with such approved product candidates, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely result in the Company incurring significant losses for the foreseeable future. As a result of losses that will continue throughout our development stage, we may exhaust our financial resources and be unable to complete the development of our product candidates.\nOur ability to become profitable depends primarily on the following factors:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain adequate sources of continued financing;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain approval for, and if approved, to successfully commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully enter into license, development or other partnership agreements with third-parties for the development and/or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour R&D efforts, including the timing and cost of clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into favorable alliances with third-parties who can provide substantial capabilities in clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory affairs, sales, marketing, and distribution.\nEven if we successfully develop and market our product candidates, we may not generate sufficient or sustainable revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") of $197.8 million to offset future taxable income, of which $140.6 million begins to expire if not utilized by 2037, and $57.2 million, which has no expiration.\nThe July 2015 purchase of 6,459,948 shares of common stock by David Davidovich, currently our largest stockholder, yielded a post-transaction ownership percentage of 60.2% for him and following the Merger, Mr. Davidovich\u2019s ownership percentage was 18.2%. We believe it highly likely that this transaction will be viewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as a change of ownership as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Section 382\"). Consequently, the utilization of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards in existence at July 9, 2015, will be limited according to the provisions of Section 382, which could significantly limit the Company\u2019s ability to use these carryforwards to offset taxable income on an annual basis in future periods. As such, a significant portion of these carryforwards could expire before they can be utilized, even if the Company is able to generate taxable income that, except for this transaction, would have been sufficient to fully utilize these carry forwards.\nWe currently do not generate significant revenue from product sales and may never become profitable, or, if we achieves profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue, including our product candidates for which we have received approval in certain foreign jurisdictions. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for such product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are currently only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities and will only initiate a Phase 3 trial for STAT-201 in the United States in the second quarter of 2022.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval of products in our STAT-200 or STAT-400 AIMS programs or any other product candidates, there can be no guarantee that we will generate revenue from such products. Our ability to generate revenue from sales of our product candidates depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\ncomplete research regarding, and nonclinical and clinical development of, our proprietary product candidates;\n\u2022\nformulate appropriate dosing protocols and drug preparation methods;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations for product candidates for which we complete clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndevelop sustainable and scalable manufacturing processes, including establishing and maintaining commercially viable supply relationships with third parties;\n\u2022\ncompliantly launch and commercialize product candidates for which we obtains regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;\n\u2022\nobtain market acceptance of our product candidates and their routes of administration as viable treatment options;\n\u2022\nidentify, assess, acquire and/or develop new product candidates;\n\u2022\naddress any competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nnegotiate and maintain favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a \"going concern.\"\nWe and our auditors have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date of the financial statements included in this annual report. Additionally, as a result of the letter we received on March 25, 2022 from our principal secured lender, in which such lender alleged that we were in default of our obligations under the loan agreement with such lender, the lender foreclosed on $4.8 million of our cash previously held in a bank account subject to a control agreement in favor of the lender, leaving us with little operating cash. We intend to fund future operations through additional private or public debt or equity offerings, and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we will need to significantly modify our operational plans to continue as a going concern or even seek the protection of federal insolvency laws.\nA failure to cure any alleged default under the Loan and Security Agreement, which allows the lender to take action, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $15 million of debt outstanding under our Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of April 26, 2021, between the Company and Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund, L.P. (\"Avenue\"), as the lender, (the \"Loan Agreement\"). On March 25, 2022, we received a letter (the \"Letter\") from Avenue alleging events of default in violation of certain provisions of the Loan Agreement. In the Letter, Avenue purported to exercise its rights to suspend further loans or advances to us under the Loan Agreement and to accelerate the amount due under the Loan Agreement, which it asserts to be approximately $11.2 million, inclusive of fees of penalties. Avenue further states in the letter that interest will continue to accrue on the outstanding amounts at the default rate of 5.0%. In furtherance of the allegations set forth in the Letter, Avenue foreclosed on approximately $4.8 million of our cash. We are in the process of determining whether the assertion of our default gives rise to, accelerates or otherwise results in a violation or event of default under any of its other material obligations.\nOn April 18, 2022, we have entered into a Forbearance and Second Amendment to Loan Documents (the \"Forbearance Agreement\") regarding the Loan Agreement, pursuant to which Avenue agreed, among other things, during the period commencing on April 18, 2022 through and including May 31, 2022 to forbear from enforcing their rights or seeking to collect payment of our debt. If the Company does not obtain a further amendment or waiver of the defaults or if Avenue takes the position that the Company has not complied with the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, there can be no assurance that Avenue will not take action to collect payment of our debt or dispose of collateral securing the debt. In such event, we could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection and stockholders would likely lose their entire investment in us.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that Avenue would provide us with a waiver of default or further extension of the Forbearance Agreement should we not be in compliance in the future. A failure to maintain compliance, in the event Avenue does not agree to a waiver or extension to the Forbearance Agreement, would cause the outstanding borrowings to be in default and payable on demand which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur growth strategy may require us to secure significant additional capital, the amount of which will depend upon the size, timing, and structure of future acquisitions or vertical integrations and our working capital and general corporate needs.\nOur growth strategy includes the possible acquisition of other businesses and the potential integration of new product lines or related products. These actions may require us to secure significant additional capital through the borrowing of money or the issuance of equity. Any borrowings made to finance future strategic initiatives could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our operating results, a downturn in economic conditions, or increases in interest rates on borrowings that are subject to interest rate fluctuations. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to meet our debt service requirements, we could then be required to sell additional equity securities, refinance our obligations or dispose of assets in order to meet our debt service requirements. Adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us. The failure to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects.\nFurther, we could choose to finance acquisitions or other strategic initiatives, in whole or in part through the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock. If we do so, existing stockholders will experience dilution in the voting power of their common stock and earnings per share could be negatively impacted. The extent to which we will be able and willing to use our common stock for acquisitions and other strategic initiatives will depend on the market value of our common stock and the willingness of potential third parties to accept our common stock as full or partial consideration. Our inability to use our common stock as consideration, to generate cash from operations, or to obtain additional funding through debt or equity financings in order to pursue our strategic initiatives could materially limit our growth.\nRisks Related to Product Development\nWe are currently pursuing five clinical stage development product candidates, and our business is dependent on the success of all or any of such product candidates.\nWe expect that a substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures over the next several years will be devoted to developing the product candidates in the STAT-200 and STAT-400 AIMS programs. We are actively pursuing three clinical stage developmental product candidates in our STAT-200 and STAT-400 AIMS programs: STAT-201, STAT-205 and STAT-401, and intend to pursue additional product candidates in the future, including STAT-202, STAT-203 and STAT-204. Our most advanced drug candidate, STAT-201, is focused on the restoration of mucosal healing and intestinal barrier function as an adjunct to the standard of care in pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease. Subject to discussions with the FDA, we are currently preparing to initiate a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of STAT-201 in pediatric subjects with active Crohn\u2019s disease. Our other drug candidates include STAT-401, an injectable pentapeptide that we plan to develop as an adjunct to the standard of care therapy to extend the duration of disease remission in patients with pancreatic cancer. Subject to discussions with the FDA, we are pursuing a phase 2 development program for STAT-401 and plan to initiate a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in the second half of 2022. We are in the process of developing STAT-203 to prevent disease progression in patients with MS. Subject to discussions with the FDA and submission and acceptance of an IND, and adequate financial capital, we may develop a phase 2 clinical trial for STAT-203 which would be expected to begin in 2023. We are additionally in the process of developing STAT-202, a selective immunomodulatory, to reduce the pain associated with fibromyalgia. Subject to discussions with the FDA and submission and acceptance of an IND, and adequate financial capital, we may develop STAT-202 in the management of fibromyalgia in [2023 or 2024]. We have received authorization from the FDA to commence a Phase 2 study using STAT-205 to prevent the advancement of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from mild to severe disease. We anticipate initiating enrollment of patients in this clinical trial this year. Accordingly, our business depends heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval, and commercialization the product candidates in the STAT-200 and STAT-400 AIMS programs. We can provide no assurance that these product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if such candidates received regulatory approval. If we discontinue development of the product candidates in the STAT-200 and STAT-400 AIMS programs, or these candidates fail to achieve significant market acceptance, we may never achieve profitability.\nWe may not be able to successfully and timely develop our products.\nOur product candidates range from ones currently in the research stage to ones currently in the clinical stage of development and all require further testing to determine their technical and commercial viability. Our success will depend on our ability to achieve scientific, clinical, and technological advances and to translate such advances into reliable, commercially competitive products in a timely manner. In addition, the success of our subsidiaries and joint ventures will depend on their ability to meet developmental milestones in a timely manner or to fulfill certain other development requirements under contractual agreements, which are prerequisites to their receipt of additional funding from their non-controlling interest holders or the government agency funding their R&D efforts. Products that we may develop are not likely to be commercially available for some time. The proposed development schedules for our products may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, technological difficulties, proprietary technology of others, the government approval process, the availability of funds, disagreements with the financial partners in our subsidiaries or joint ventures, the effects of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, including access to clinical trial sites both by patents and our clinical research organizations, and changes in government regulation, many of which will not be within our control. Any delay in the development, introduction or marketing of our products could result either in such products being marketed at a time when their cost and performance characteristics would not be competitive in the marketplace or in the shortening of their commercial lives. In light of the long-term nature of our projects and the unproven technology involved, we may not be able to successfully complete the development or marketing of any products.\nWe may fail to develop and commercialize some or all of our products successfully or in a timely manner because:\n\u2022\npreclinical or clinical study results may show the product to be less effective than desired (e.g., a study may fail to meet its primary objectives) or to have harmful or problematic side effects;\n\u2022\nwe fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals or there may be a delay in receiving such approvals. Among other things, such delays may be caused by slow enrollment in clinical studies, length of time to achieve study endpoints, additional time requirements for data analysis or pre-EUA, MAA, NDA, or BLA preparation, discussions with the FDA, EMA, and other regulatory agencies, and their request for additional preclinical or clinical data or unexpected safety or manufacturing issues;\n\u2022\nour contract laboratories fail to follow good laboratory practices or sufficient quantities of the drug are not available for clinical studies or commercialization;\n\u2022\nwe fail to receive funding necessary for the development of one or more of our products;\n\u2022\nthey fail to conform to a changing standard of care for the diseases they seek to treat;\n\u2022\nthey are less effective or more expensive than current or alternative treatment methods;\n\u2022\npatients withdraw or die during a clinical trial for a variety of reasons, including adverse events associated with the advanced stage of their disease and medical problems that may or may not be related to our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe clinical or animal trial design, although approved, is inadequate to demonstrate safety and/or efficacy;\n\u2022\nthe third-party clinical investigators or contract organizations do not perform our clinical or animal studies on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the study protocol or do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nthe economic feasibility of the product is not attainable due to high manufacturing costs, pricing or reimbursement issues, or other factors;\n\u2022\none or more of our financial partners in our subsidiaries or joint ventures and us do not agree on the development strategy of our products;\n\u2022\nproprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies may prevent our product from being commercialized;\n\u2022\nwe are not successful in hiring, training, and deploying a sales force or contracting with third parties to commercialize our product candidates or in creating market demand for our product candidates through marketing, sales and promotion activities;\n\u2022\nour product candidates fail to achieve market acceptance by patients, the medical community, and/or third-party payors; or\n\u2022\nor we do not maintain patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates.\nEven if we successfully obtain approval from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities for the product candidates in the STAT-200 and STAT-400 AIMS programs, any approval might contain significant limitations related to use as well as warnings, precautions or contraindications, or requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS. Any such limitations or restrictions could similarly impact any supplemental marketing approvals we may obtain for the product candidates in the STAT-200 and STAT-400 AIMS programs. Furthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approval for the product candidates in the STAT-200 and STAT-400 AIMS programs, we will still need to develop a commercial infrastructure or develop relationships with collaborators to commercialize, establish a commercially viable pricing structure and obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government healthcare programs. If we, or any future collaborators, are unable to successfully commercialize the product candidates in the STAT-200 and STAT-400 AIMS programs, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nOur collaborative relationships with third parties could cause us to expend significant resources and incur substantial business risk with no assurance of financial return.\nWe anticipate substantial reliance upon strategic collaborations for marketing and commercialization of our product candidates and we may rely even more on strategic collaborations for R&D of our product candidates. Our business depends on our ability to sell drugs to both government agencies and to the general pharmaceutical market. Offering entolimod for its biodefense indication to government agencies may require us to develop new sales, marketing or distribution capabilities beyond those already existing in the Company and we may not be successful in selling entolimod for its biodefense indication in the U.S. or in foreign countries despite our efforts. Selling oncology drugs will require a more significant infrastructure. We plan to sell oncology drugs through strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical companies. If we are unable to establish or manage such strategic collaborations on terms favorable to us in the future, our revenue and drug development may be limited. To date, we have not entered into any strategic collaboration with a third-party capable of providing these services and we can make no guarantee that we will be able to enter into a strategic collaboration in the future. In addition, we have not yet marketed or sold any of our product candidates or entered into successful collaborations for these services in order to ultimately commercialize our product candidates. We also rely on third-party collaborations with our manufacturers. Manufacturers producing our product candidates must follow GMP regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign equivalents.\nEstablishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our discussion with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory, or intellectual property position. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of our product candidates or the generation of sales revenue. In addition, to the extent that we enter into collaborative arrangements, our drug revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold any drugs that we may develop.\nWe will not be able to commercialize our product candidates if our preclinical development efforts are not successful, our clinical trials do not demonstrate safety or our clinical trials or pivotal animal studies do not demonstrate efficacy.\nBefore obtaining required regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive preclinical and clinical studies to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and clinical or pivotal animal trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are efficacious. And for entolimod's biodefense indication we must demonstrate a logical dosing correlation between animals and humans. These R&D activities are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials or animal efficacy studies will be successful and interim results of a clinical trial or animal efficacy study do not necessarily predict final results. In addition, we will likely have to continue to outsource all or part of individual R&D activities and may not successfully or promptly finalize agreements for the conduct of these activities. Consequently, delays in completion of contracted activities may result.\nEngagement of CROs, study investigators, and other third parties for clinical or animal testing or data management services, for example, transfers substantial responsibilities to these parties. As such we are dependent on these parties to timely execute their contracted work in a quality manner that complies with relevant standards and regulations such as GLPs. Failure of these parties to deliver timely and quality services could result in delays in, or termination of, contracted R&D activities. For example, if any of our clinical trial sites fail to comply with GCPs or our pivotal animal studies fail to comply with GLP regulations we may be unable to use the data generated. Consequently, if contracted CROs or other third parties do not properly execute their duties or fail to meet expected deadlines, our research activities may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nOur pivotal nonclinical and clinical trial operations are subject to regulatory inspections at any time. If regulatory inspectors conclude that we or our trial sites are not in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements for conducting such trials, we or they may receive warning letters or other correspondence detailing deficiencies and we will be required to implement corrective actions. If regulatory agencies deem our responses to be inadequate, or are dissatisfied with the corrective actions that we or our clinical trial sites have implemented, our clinical trials may be temporarily or permanently discontinued, we may be fined, we or our investigators may be the subject of an enforcement action, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products or we may be criminally prosecuted.\nIn addition, a failure of one or more of our clinical trials or animal studies can occur at any stage of testing and such failure could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and could require us to reduce the scope of or discontinue our operations. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial or animal study process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nwe may fail to reach an agreement with regulators or IRBs regarding the scope, design, or implementation of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nregulators or IRBs may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial, conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site or continue a clinical trial following amendment of a clinical trial protocol or an IACUC may not authorize us to commence an animal study at a prospective study site;\n\u2022\nwe may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical or clinical studies, or we may abandon projects that we expect to be promising, if our preclinical tests, clinical trials or animal efficacy studies produce negative or inconclusive results;\n\u2022\nwe may have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable safety risks;\n\u2022\nregulators or IRBs may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical development for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or if it is believed that the clinical trials present an unacceptable safety risk to the patients enrolled in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our clinical trials or animal studies could escalate and become cost prohibitive;\n\u2022\nany regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the product not commercially viable;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of raw materials or manufactured product candidates (whether provided by the Company or third parties) or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or in a timely manner, or we may experience interruptions in supply;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our current and future product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or be lost to follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\npatients that enroll in our studies may misrepresent their eligibility or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting in the need to drop the patients from the study or clinical trial, increase the needed enrollment size for the clinical trial or extend our duration;\n\u2022\nclinical trial participants may elect to participate in alternative clinical trials sponsored by our competitors with product candidates that treat the same indications as our product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not be successful in recruiting a sufficient number of qualifying subjects for our clinical trials or certain animals used in our animal studies or facilities conducting our studies may not be available at the time that we plan to initiate a study;\n\u2022\nthe effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects, may include undesirable side effects, or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics;\n\u2022\nthere may be regulatory questions or disagreements regarding interpretations of data and results, or new information may emerge regarding our current and future product candidates\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from studies with clinical trial sites in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our proposed indications, fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or our manufacturing facilities for clinical and future commercial supplies, and may take longer than we anticipate to review any regulatory submissions it may make for our current or any future product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate provides an advantage over current standards of care or current or future competitive therapies in development; and\n\u2022\nour collaborators that conduct our clinical or pivotal animal studies could go out of business and not be available for FDA inspection when we submit our product for approval.\nIn addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the likelihood that we encounter such difficulties or delays in initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing our planned clinical trials. If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. Moreover, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues.\nThe results from preclinical studies or clinical trials of a product candidate may not predict the results of later clinical trials of the product candidate, and interim results of a clinical trial are not necessarily indicative of final results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, including genetic differences, patient adherence to the dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Additionally, any future preclinical and clinical data may be susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials.\nEven if we or our collaborators complete our animal studies and clinical trials and receive regulatory approval, it is possible that a product may be found to be ineffective or unsafe due to conditions or facts that arise after development has been completed and regulatory approvals have been obtained. In this event, we may be required to withdraw such product from the market. To the extent that our success will depend on any regulatory approvals from government authorities outside of the U.S. that perform roles similar to that of the FDA, uncertainties similar to those stated above will also exist.\nInterim, top-line and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data becomes available and is subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or topline data from our clinical studies, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the preliminary or topline results reported may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data has been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remains subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nFrom time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our clinical studies. Interim data from clinical trials that we complete is subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\nPanacela and GPI have significant non-controlling interest holders and, as such, each may not be operated solely for our benefit.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned 67.57% of the equity interests in Panacela and 50% of the equity interests in GPI. Rusnano, a fund regulated by the Russian government, is a significant shareholder, along with other minority shareholders, in Panacela. Everon, a Buffalo, New York-based biopharmaceutical company, holds the other 50% of the equity interest in GPI. Additionally, as a result of its investment in GPI, Norma was granted a number of governance and other rights with respect to GPI. As such, we share ownership and management of Panacela and GPI with other parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do.\nWith respect to Panacela, both we and Rusnano have certain rights, including the right to designate board members and the need for either supermajority votes or consent of all members of Panacela\u2019s board of directors in order to take certain actions. Additionally, the right to transfer ownership is restricted by rights of first refusal, tag-along and drag-along rights. Consequently, if a co-owner sells its equity interest to a new party, the new party may adversely affect the operation of Panacela. These restrictions lead to organizational formalities that may be time-consuming. In addition, the benefits from a successful product development effort are shared among the co-owners.\nWith respect to GPI, under the terms of Norma\u2019s investment, upon the occurrence of a number of different events, Norma has the right to require GPI to issue to Norma a number of shares in GPI, thereby further diluting our interest. Additionally, the Company, Everon, GPI and Norma each made certain commitments as to voting and transfer of their shares of GPI and GPI\u2019s governance, including an agreement that the board of directors of GPI will consist of four members, two of whom will be selected by Norma, one of whom will be selected by the Company and one of whom will be selected by Everon. GPI is also prohibited from taking a number of actions without the unanimous consent of all of the members of GPI\u2019s board of directors, including, among other things, effecting a change of control transaction, terminating its operations, dissolving or liquidating, amending its organizational documents, transferring or licensing its intellectual property, or issuing any shares of capital stock.\nWe understand that until February 2022, Norma was majority controlled or owned, indirectly, by Roman Abramovich, a global investor with ties to high-level members of the government of Russia. While neither Norma nor Mr. Abramovich have been the subject of sanctions by the US Government , the government of the UK has ordered asset freezes, imposed travel bans and otherwise imposed sanctions on Mr. Abramovich. Major media organizations have reported that ownership in Norma was transferred from Mr. Abramovich to David Davidovich, the holder of approximately [20]% of our common stock who is not, as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, subject to sanctions by the US or UK governments. If governing authorities in the UK unwind this transfer or if Norma or Mr. Davidovich become subject to sanctions by the US or UK governments, it may be difficult or impossible for Norma, which is a British Virgin Islands company subject to UK jurisdiction, to invest further funds in GPI and/or for GPI to issue shares or remit funds to Norma should the contractual terms of Norma\u2019s investment in GPI otherwise require it to. This could materially and adversely affect the value of our investment in GPI, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf parties on whom we rely to manufacture our product candidates do not manufacture them in satisfactory quality, in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities, or at an acceptable cost, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. Consequently, we rely on third parties as sole suppliers of our product candidates. We do not expect to establish our own manufacturing facilities and we will continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce supplies for preclinical, clinical, and pivotal animal studies and for commercial quantities of any products or product candidates that we market or may supply to our collaborators. We also rely on third parties as sole providers of certain testing of our products. Our dependence on third parties for the manufacture and testing of our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize any product candidates on a timely and competitive basis.\nTo date, our product candidates have only been manufactured in quantities sufficient for preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. We rely on a single contract organization, Wacker Biotech B.V., for production of each of our STAT -600 product candidates. For a variety of reasons, dependence on any single manufacturer may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates in a timely and competitive manner. In addition, our current contractual arrangements alone may not be sufficient to guarantee that we will be able to procure the needed supplies as we complete clinical development and/or enter commercialization.\nAdditionally, in connection with our application for commercial approvals and if any product candidate is approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for commercial sale, we will need to procure commercial quantities of the product candidate from qualified third-party manufacturers. We may not be able to contract for increased manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or economic manner or at all. A significant scale-up in manufacturing may require additional validation studies and commensurate financial investments by the contract manufacturers. If we are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate may be delayed or there may be a shortage of supply, which could limit our sales and could initiate regulatory intervention to minimize public health risk.\nOther risks associated with our reliance on contract manufacturers include the following:\n\u2022\ncontract manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving volume production, quality control, and quality assurance and also may experience shortages in qualified personnel and obtaining active ingredients for our product candidates, including delays or shortages due to limited supply or capacity of production facilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\nif, for any circumstance, we are required to change manufacturers, we could be faced with significant monetary and lost opportunity costs with switching manufacturers. Furthermore, such change may take a significant amount of time. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturers in advance. This requires prior approval of regulatory submissions as well as successful completion of pre-approval inspections to ensure compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and standards;\n\u2022\ncontract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic, unannounced inspection by the FDA and state and foreign agencies or their designees to ensure strict compliance with GMPs and other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over compliance by our contract manufacturers with these regulations and standards. Our contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with GMPs and other FDA requirements or other regulatory requirements outside the U.S. Failure of contract manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in delays, suspensions or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of product candidates and operating restrictions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business;\n\u2022\ncontract manufacturers might not be able or refuse to fulfill our commercial or clinical trial needs, which would require us to seek new manufacturing arrangements and may result in substantial delays in meeting market or clinical trial demands;\n\u2022\nour product costs may increase if our manufacturers pass their increasing costs of manufacture on to us;\n\u2022\nif our contract manufacturers do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we will not be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products and product candidates and will not be able to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates. In such event, we may not be able to locate any necessary acceptable replacement manufacturers or enter into favorable agreements with such replacement manufacturers in a timely manner, if at all; and\n\u2022\ncontract manufacturers may breach the manufacturing agreements that we have with them because of factors beyond our control or may terminate or fail to renew a manufacturing agreement based on their own business priorities at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.\nChanges to the manufacturing process during the conduct of clinical trials or after marketing approval also require regulatory submissions and the demonstration to the FDA or other regulatory authorities that the product manufactured under the new conditions complies with GMPs requirements. These requirements especially apply to moving manufacturing functions to another facility. In each phase of investigation, sufficient information about changes in the manufacturing process must be submitted to the regulatory authorities and may require prior approval before implementation with the potential of substantial delay or the inability to implement the requested changes.\nIf the market opportunities for our products are smaller than we expected, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nThe precise incidence and prevalence for all the conditions we aim to address with our product candidates are unknown. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new trials may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The total addressable market across all of our product candidates will ultimately depend upon, among other things, the diagnosis criteria included in the final label for each of our product candidates approved for sale for these indications, the availability of alternative treatments and the safety, convenience, cost and efficacy of our product candidates relative to such alternative treatments, acceptance by the medical community and patient access, drug pricing and reimbursement. The number of patients in the U.S. and other major markets and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory Approval\nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner or at all and the results of future clinical trials and pivotal efficacy studies may not be favorable.\nThe testing, marketing, and manufacturing of any product for use in the U.S. and the E.U. will require approval from the FDA and the EMA, respectively. We cannot predict with any certainty the amount of time necessary to obtain FDA approval and whether any such approval will ultimately be granted. Preclinical studies, animal efficacy studies, or clinical trials may reveal that one or more products are ineffective or unsafe, in which event, further development of such products could be seriously delayed, terminated or rendered more expensive.\nIn addition, we expect to rely on the FDA Animal Rule to obtain approval for entolimod\u2019s biodefense indication in the U.S. The Animal Rule permits the use of animal efficacy studies together with human clinical safety trials to support an application for marketing approval of products when human efficacy studies are neither ethical nor feasible. These regulations have limited prior use and we have limited experience in the application of these rules to the product candidates that we are developing. We cannot guarantee that the FDA will review the data submitted in a timely manner, or that the FDA will accept the data when reviewed. If we are not successful in completing the development, licensure, and commercialization of entolimod for its biodefense indication, or if we are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nEven if we eventually complete clinical trials and receive approval for our product candidates, the FDA or EMA may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and/or the implementation of a REMS, which may be required to ensure safe use of the drug after approval.\nDelays in obtaining FDA, EMA, or any other necessary regulatory approvals of any proposed product or the failure to receive such approvals would have an adverse effect on our ability to develop such product, the product\u2019s potential commercial success and/or on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside of our control.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical studies of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of completion of clinical trials depends in part on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing such product candidates, and we may experience delays in our clinical trials if it encounters difficulties in enrollment or retention. Patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the effectiveness of patient recruitment efforts, delays in enrollment due to travel or quarantine policies, or other factors, related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the existing body of safety and efficacy data with respect to the study candidate, the number and nature of competing existing treatments for our target indications, the number and nature of ongoing trials for other product candidates in development for our target indications, patients with pre-existing conditions that preclude their participation in any trial, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study. Furthermore, any other negative results we may report in clinical trials of any of our product candidates in the future may make it difficult or impossible to recruit and retain patients in other clinical trials of those product candidates. Similarly, negative results reported by our competitors about their product candidates may negatively affect patient recruitment in our clinical trials. Delays or failures in planned patient enrollment or retention may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop our product candidates or could render further development impossible.\nCompensatory arrangements with our scientific advisors or consultants could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and ultimately lead to the delay or denial of marketing approval for our product candidates.\nPrincipal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may conclude that a financial relationship between the Company and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our product candidates.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions could prevent us from marketing our products abroad.\nWe intend to market our product candidates, including specifically the product candidates being developed by our Russian subsidiaries, in the U.S., Europe, Russia, and other countries and regulatory jurisdictions. In order to market our product candidates in the U.S., Europe, Russia, and other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals in each of these countries and territories. The procedures and requirements for obtaining marketing approval vary among countries and regulatory jurisdictions and may involve additional clinical trials or other tests. In addition, we do not have in-house experience and expertise regarding the procedures and requirements to file for and obtain marketing approval for drugs in countries outside of the U.S., Europe, and Japan and may need to engage and rely upon expertise of third parties when we file for marketing approval in countries outside of the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Also, the time required to obtain approval in markets outside of the U.S. may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval, while still including all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not be able to obtain all of the desirable or necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by a regulatory authority in a particular country or regulatory jurisdiction, such as the FDA in the U.S. or the EMA in the E.U., does not ensure approval by a regulatory authority in another country.\nWe may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any or all of the countries or regulatory jurisdictions in which we desire to market our product candidates. At this time, to our knowledge, other countries do not have an equivalent to the Animal Rule and, as a result, such countries do not likely have established criteria for review and approval for this type of product outside their normal review process.\nThe Fast Track designation for entolimod may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe have obtained a \"Fast Track\" designation from the FDA for entolimod\u2019s biodefense indication. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply to the FDA for Fast Track Designation. However, we may not experience a faster development process, review, or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw our Fast Track designation if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical or pivotal development program. Our Fast Track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the FDA\u2019s expedited review procedures or that any application that we may submit to the FDA for regulatory approval will be accepted for filing or ultimately approved.\nWe may seek Breakthrough Therapy Designation for some of our product candidates. The designation may not be granted and, even if granted by the FDA, such designation may not lead to a faster development of any product candidate or approval process for any product candidate.\nWe may seek a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for some of our product candidates. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time the NDA is submitted to the FDA.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. Even if we receives breakthrough therapy designation, the receipt of such designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development of any product candidate or approval process for product candidate. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that certain of our product candidates satisfy the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for such product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as expected, the approval pathway for those product candidates will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in either case may not be successful.\nWe plan to seek FDA approval through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for several of our product candidates. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable to the Company under the FDCA, would allow an NDA submitted by us to the FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA\u2019s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved compounds, which could expedite the development program for our product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for these product candidates, and complications and risks associated with these product candidates, would likely substantially increase. We may need to obtain additional funding, which could result in significant dilution to the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders to the extent we issue equity securities or convertible debt. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway would likely result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product candidates, which would likely materially adversely impact on our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee that our product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may change its Section 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that the Company submits under Section 505(b)(2). In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDAs for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of any litigation. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. In addition, even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to faster product development or earlier approval.\nMoreover, even if our product candidates are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products.\nThe pre-EUA submission we made to the FDA in 2015 may not be successful and, even if such submission is successful, it may not accelerate BLA approval of entolimod or result in any purchase by the U.S. government for this product.\nIn July 2014, we met with the FDA regarding human dose-conversion of entolimod and based on the results of that meeting, we submitted a pre-EUA dossier in the second quarter of 2015 in order to inform and expedite the FDA\u2019s issuance of an EUA, should one become necessary in the event of an emergency. The FDA does not have review deadlines with respect to pre-EUA submissions and, therefore, the timing of any approval of a pre-EUA submission is uncertain.\nThe FDA may decide not to accept the data or may decide that our data are insufficient for pre-EUA. The FDA may require additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (\"CMC\"), preclinical, clinical or other studies, refuse to approve our products, or place restrictions on our ability to commercialize those products. The FDA agreed last year that the Company had documented analytical comparability and bio-comparability in NHP and agreed to continue the review of the pre-EUA dossier by the Agency. There can be no guarantee that the FDA will not request any additional information related to our preclinical, clinical or manufacturing programs.\nFurther, even if our pre-EUA submission is authorized, there is no guarantee that such authorization will lead to procurement by the U.S. or other governments If we are not successful in partnering entolimod or completing the development, licensure and commercialization of entolimod for its biodefense indication use, or if we are significantly delayed in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.\nEven if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, we will be subject to ongoing government regulation.\nEven if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, our products will be subject to continuing regulation by international health authorities, updated safety and efficacy information must be maintained and provided to the authorities. We or our collaborative partners, if any, must comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling, including the prohibition against promoting non-approved or \"off-label\" indications or products. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in significant enforcement action by the international health authorities, including warning letters, orders to pull the promotional materials and substantial fines.\nAfter the approval of a product, the discovery of problems with a product or its class, or the failure to comply with requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved marketing application. These include withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary or regulatory agency-initiated action that could delay or prevent further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data, including from other products in a therapeutic class, may require changes to a product\u2019s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications. They may also require surveillance to monitor the product\u2019s safety or efficacy to evaluate long-term effects. It is also possible that rare but serious adverse events not seen in our drug candidates may be identified after marketing approval. This could result in withdrawal of our product from the market.\nCompliance with post-marketing regulations may be time-consuming and costly and could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the commercialization of our drug candidates.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept and use our drugs, we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nEven if we gain marketing approval of our drug candidates, government purchasers, physicians and/or patients may not accept and use them. Acceptance and use of these products may depend on a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nperceptions by members of the government healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drugs;\n\u2022\npublished studies demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of our drugs;\n\u2022 adequate reimbursement for our products from payors; and\n\u2022\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nThe failure of our drugs, if approved for marketing, to gain acceptance in the market would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.\nRecently enacted legislation, future legislation and healthcare reform measures may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval for and commercialize our product candidates and may affect the prices we may set for such products.\nIn the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of adopted and proposed legislative and regulatory changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the product candidates in the STAT-200 and STAT-400 AIMS programs or any of our other product candidates, restrict or regulate post-marketing activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any of our product candidates for which it obtains regulatory approval.\nIn the U.S., the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. Cost reduction initiatives and other changes to provisions of this legislation could limit the coverage and reimbursement rate that the Company receives for any of our approved products. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the \"Affordable Care Act,\" was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:\n\u25cf\nThe Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents from 15.1% of AMP to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for \"line extensions\" (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP.\n\u25cf\nEffective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children\u2019s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In July 2013, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) issued a final rule allowing the newly eligible entities to access discounted orphan drugs if used for non-orphan indications. While the final rule was vacated by a federal court ruling, HRSA has stated it will continue to allow discounts for orphan drugs when used for any indication other than for orphan indications. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.\n\u25cf\nThe Affordable Care Act created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, \"IPAB,\" which, beginning in 2014, has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings. IPAB recommendations are only required when Medicare spending exceeds a target growth rate established by the Affordable Care Act. Members of the IPAB have still not been appointed and Medicare cost growth is below the threshold that would require IPAB recommendations.\n\u25cf\nThe Affordable Care Act established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.\n\u25cf\nEffective January 1, 2020, the federal spending package permanently eliminated the Affordable Care Act-mandated \"Cadillac\" tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax.\n\u25cf\nOn December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \"individual mandate\" was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court also dismissed the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act in June 2021. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act.\nFurther changes to and under the Affordable Care Act remain possible. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace the Affordable Care Act would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. The Company expects that changes to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.\nThe Company expects that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that the Company receives for our product candidates and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent the Company from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nThe Company is not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject the Company to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing approval testing and other requirements.\nIn Europe, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020. A significant portion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from the regulations of the European Union, and European Union pharmaceutical law remains applicable to the United Kingdom until December 31, 2020. The Company cannot predict what consequences the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union might have on the regulatory frameworks of the United Kingdom or the European Union, or on our future operations, if any, in these jurisdictions.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. The company cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nthe demand for our product candidates, if they obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nour ability to receive or set a price that it believes is fair for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u2022\nthe level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital.\nIf adopted, these and other healthcare reform measures may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, lower reimbursement, and new payment methodologies. This could lower the price that we receive for any approved product. Any denial in coverage or reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar denial or reduction in payments from private payors, which may prevent us from being able to generate sufficient revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\nWe are subject to various foreign, federal, and state healthcare and privacy laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers expose us to broadly applicable foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare and privacy laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conducts our operations, including how it researches, markets, sells and distributes any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or certain rebates), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase, lease, or order, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;\n\u2022\nthe federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, also impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by covered entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers as well as their business associates that perform certain services for or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and other \"transfers of value\" made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by the patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA; state and foreign governments that have enacted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, distribution, use, security, and storage of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals (including the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR, and the California Consumer Protection Act, or CCPA), and federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied to enforce regulations related to the online collection, use, and dissemination of data, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nAs of May 25, 2018, the GDPR replaced the Data Protection Directive with respect to the processing of personal data in the European Union. The GDPR imposes many requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when the Company contracts third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to \u20ac20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties.\nEnsuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including our consulting and advisory board arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers, do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from U.S. government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against it, our business may be impaired. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from government funded healthcare programs and imprisonment. If any of the above occur, it could adversely our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, contractors and other collaborators and partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting or receiving, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the U.S., to sell our products abroad once it enters a commercialization phase, and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations and other regulatory approvals. We may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, clinical research organizations, contractors and other collaborators and partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences.\nRisks Relating to our Intellectual Property\nWe rely upon licensed patents to protect our technology. We may be unable to obtain or protect such intellectual property rights and we may be liable for infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and the proprietary technology of others with which we have entered into licensing agreements. We have entered into five separate exclusive license agreements to license from third parties our product candidates that are not owned by us and some product candidates are covered by up to three separate license agreements.\nAlthough the Company has succeeded in licensing technology from The Penn State Research Foundation, Dr. Jill Smith /, LDN Research LLD and, Noreen Griffin and Fengping Shan in the past, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to in-license or acquire the rights to any product candidates or technologies from third parties on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, in April 2021, Dr. Jill Smith sent Old Cytocom a notice of termination of the license with Jill Smith and LDN Research Group, LLC (the \"Licensor Parties\"), however, the Licensor Parties are currently negotiating revised terms of the license agreement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in negotiating revised terms to this license on acceptable terms, or at all.\nPursuant to these license agreements we maintain patents and patent applications covering our product candidates. We do not know whether any of these patent applications that are still in the approval process will ultimately result in the issuance of a patent with respect to the technology owned by us or licensed to us. The patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the United States Patent and Trademark Office use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others.\nOur technology may be found in the future to infringe upon the rights of others or be infringed upon by others. In such a case, others may assert infringement claims against us, and should we be found to infringe upon their patents, or otherwise impermissibly utilize their intellectual property, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties\u2019 patent rights. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell products. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, we may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of this intellectual property, enter into royalty agreements, or redesign our products so as not to utilize this intellectual property, each of which may prove to be uneconomical or otherwise impossible. Conversely, we may not always be able to successfully pursue our claims against others that infringe upon our technology and the technology exclusively licensed by us or developed with our collaborative partners. Thus, the proprietary nature of our technology or technology licensed by us may not provide adequate protection against competitors.\nMoreover, the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to our patents and other intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial and the litigation would divert our management\u2019s efforts and our resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations.\nIn addition, the in-licensing and acquisition of these technologies is a highly competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire product candidates or technologies that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to license rights to us. Furthermore, we may be unable to identify suitable product candidates or technologies within our area of focus. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable product candidates or technologies, our business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our license agreement with third parties, we could lose our ability to develop our product candidates.\nThe manufacture and sale of any products developed by us may involve the use of processes, products or information, the rights to certain of which are owned by others. Although we have obtained exclusive licenses for our product candidates from The Cleveland Clinic and RPCI with regard to the use of patent applications as described above and certain processes, products and information of others, these licenses could be terminated or expire during critical periods and we may not be able to obtain licenses for other rights that may be important to us, or, if obtained, such licenses may not be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, some of our product candidates require the use of technology licensed from multiple third parties, each of which is necessary for the development of such product candidates. If we are unable to maintain and/or obtain licenses, we may have to develop alternatives to avoid infringing upon the patents of others, potentially causing increased costs and delays in product development and introduction or precluding the development, manufacture, or sale of planned products. Additionally, the patents underlying any licenses may not be valid and enforceable. To the extent any products developed by us are based on licensed technology, royalty payments on the licenses will reduce our gross profit from such product sales and may render the sales of such products uneconomical.\nOur current exclusive licenses impose various development, royalty, diligence, record keeping, insurance, solvency and other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations and do not cure such breaches within the relevant cure period, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology.\nIn addition, while we cannot currently determine the dollar amount of the royalty and other payments we will be required to make in the future under the license agreements, if any, the amounts may be significant. The dollar amount of our future payment obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any.\nWe depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties, and our licensors may not always act in our best interest\nIf our licensors fail to adequately protect our licensed intellectual property, our ability to commercialize product candidates could suffer. We do not have complete control over the maintenance, prosecution and litigation of our in-licensed patents and patent applications and may have limited control over future intellectual property that may be in-licensed. For example, we cannot be certain that activities such as the maintenance and prosecution by our licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights. It is possible that our licensors\u2019 infringement proceedings or defense activities may be less vigorous than had we conducted them ourselves or may not be conducted in accordance with our best interests.\nIf we are not able to protect and control our unpatented trade secrets, know-how and other technology, we may suffer competitive harm.\nWe also rely on a combination of trade secrets, know-how, technology and nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our rights in the technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect and we rely on third parties to develop our products and thus must share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees, and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements will typically restrict the ability of our collaborators, advisors, employees, and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets. Our academic collaborators typically have rights to publish data, provided that we are notified in advance and may delay publication for a specified time in order to secure our intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of these agreements, independent development or publication of information including our trade secrets in cases where we do not have proprietary or otherwise protected rights at the time of publication. If any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent or intellectual property right were disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in patent law in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain.\nPast or future patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. For example, in March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or America Invents Act, the U.S. moved from a \"first to invent\" to a \"first-to-file\" patent system. Under a \"first-to-file\" system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to a patent on the invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The America Invents Act includes a number of other significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and establish a new post-grant review system. The effects of these changes continue to evolve as the USPTO continues to promulgate new regulations and procedures in connection with the America Invents Act and many of the substantive changes to patent law, including the \"first-to-file\" provisions, only became effective in March 2013. In addition, the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and the applicability of the act and new regulations on the specific patents discussed in this filing have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. Moreover, the America Invents Act and our implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nAdditionally, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that the Company might obtain in the future. For example, in the case, Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules are not patent-eligible.\nSimilarly, other cases by the U.S. Supreme Court have held that certain methods of treatment or diagnosis are not patent-eligible. U.S. law regarding patent-eligibility continues to evolve. While we do not believe that any of our owned or in-licensed patents will be found invalid based on these changes to U.S. patent law, we cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the USPTO may impact the value of our patents. Any similar adverse changes in the patent laws of other jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Relating to our Industry and Other External Factors\nThe biopharmaceutical market in which we compete is highly competitive.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change. Our success will depend on our ability to develop and apply our technologies in the design and development of our product candidates and to establish and maintain a market for our product candidates. In addition, there are many companies, both public and private, including major pharmaceutical and chemical companies, specialized biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions engaged in developing pharmaceutical and biotechnology products. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, technical, research and development resources, and human resources than us. Competitors may develop products or other technologies that are more effective than those that are being developed by us or may obtain FDA or other governmental approvals for products more rapidly than us. If we commence commercial sales of products, we still must compete in the manufacturing and marketing of such products, areas in which we have no experience.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, operations and clinical development timelines and plans.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that began in December 2019 has continued to affect most countries around the world, including the United States, where a national emergency was declared in 2020. The continued spread of COVID-19 in the United States and worldwide, as well as the government-ordered shutdowns and shelter-in-place orders imposed to counter the pandemic, led to severe disruptions to the global economy, especially in the year ended December 31, 2020. In this connection, on March 20, 2020, the Governor of the State of New York announced that 100% of the workforce of all businesses, excluding essential services, must stay home. During the effectiveness of this order, we implemented a work-from-home policy for all employees based in our headquarters, then located in Buffalo, New York. While we generally experienced few effects from the COVID-19 pandemic during 2021, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business, research and development efforts, preclinical studies, clinical trials, prospects for regulatory approval of our drug candidates, and operations remains uncertain and will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts, the extent and duration of travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. In addition, if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage were to experience or re-experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth could be limited if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to identify, hire, integrate, retain, and motivate qualified executive officers and other key employees throughout all areas of our business. We greatly depend on the efforts of our executive officers to manage our operations. In addition, we utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our business, as we have limited experience in filing and prosecuting regulatory applications to obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities. The loss of services of one or more members of our management, key employees or consultants could have a negative impact on our business or our ability to expand our research, development and clinical programs. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executive officers and key employees as needed in the future. We currently do not maintain directors and officers liability insurance and are unable to make payroll from time to time due to our lack of cash, which may make it more difficult for us to retain and attract talented and skilled directors and officers to serve our Company.\nAdditionally, we depend on our scientific, manufacturing, regulatory clinical collaborators and advisors, all of whom have outside commitments that may limit their availability to us. Furthermore, to the extent that we are unable to engage certain collaborators or advisors for certain periods of time due to lack of relevant work or lack of available funds, there is a risk that such collaborators or advisors will not be available to provide services in the future at such time when there is available work and/or funds. In addition, we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific, managerial and marketing personnel, particularly as we expand our activities in clinical trials, the regulatory approval process, external partner solicitations and sales and manufacturing. We routinely enter into consulting agreements with our scientific, manufacturing, business development, regulatory, clinical collaborators, advisors, and opinion leaders in the ordinary course of our business. We also enter into contractual agreements with physicians and institutions who recruit patients into our clinical trials on our behalf in the ordinary course of our business. We face significant competition for this type of personnel and for employees from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. We cannot predict our success in hiring or retaining the personnel we require for continued growth.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees or our consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe engage as employees and consultants individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including at competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may become subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distract management.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities from any product liability and other claims if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if the product candidates are sold commercially. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us if one of the product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against the product liability claim, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize product candidates; and\n\u2022\nincreased difficulty in raising required additional funds in the private and public capital markets.\nWe currently have product liability insurance and intend to expand such coverage from coverage for clinical trials to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for any of our product candidates. However, insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nFrom time to time, we may also become subject to litigation, such as stockholder derivative claims or securities fraud claims. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require us to indemnify our current and past directors and officers from reasonable expenses related to the defense of any action arising from their service to us to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, including circumstances under which indemnification is otherwise discretionary. While we currently maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance to cover such risk exposure, we would be obligated to cover all or some of the expenses incurred as a result of claims made against our directors and officers, which may be substantial, if the conduct is outside the scope of our insurance coverage or the limits are surpassed. Such expenditure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur former laboratories used, and our subtenants use, certain chemical and biological agents and compounds that may be deemed hazardous and we are subject to various safety and environmental laws and regulations. Our compliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant costs, which could materially reduce our ability to become profitable.\nUntil late 2013, we operated laboratories that used hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment and we currently sublease these laboratories for operation by other companies, which currently use hazardous materials. As appropriate, we stored these materials and wastes resulting from their use at our laboratory facility pending their ultimate use or disposal and we currently require that our laboratory sub-lessors do the same. We contracted with a third party to properly dispose of these materials and wastes and our laboratory sub-lessors now manage such contracts. We were and continue to be subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. We may incur significant costs if we unknowingly failed to comply with environmental laws and regulations.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our product development and clinical activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of product development or clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our development programs and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our information systems from cyberattacks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including personal data, damage to our reputation, and subject it to significant financial and legal exposure.\nWe rely on information technology systems that we or our third-party providers operate to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. In connection with our product discovery efforts, we may collect and use a variety of personal data, such as names, mailing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and clinical trial information. A successful cyberattack could result in the theft or destruction of intellectual property, data, or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments, industrial espionage, wire fraud and other forms of cyber fraud, the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering fraud or other means to threaten data security, confidentiality, integrity and availability. A successful cyberattack could cause serious negative consequences for us, including, without limitation, the disruption of operations, the misappropriation of confidential business information, including financial information, trade secrets, financial loss and the disclosure of corporate strategic plans. Although we devote resources to protect our information systems, we realize that cyberattacks are a threat, and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business, legal, financial or reputational harm to the Company, or would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of our clinical data or patients\u2019 personal data could result in significant liability under state (e.g., state breach notification laws), federal (e.g., HIPAA, as amended by HITECH), and foreign law (e.g., the GDPR) and may cause a material adverse impact to our reputation, affect our ability to conduct new studies and potentially disrupt our business.\nPolitical or social factors may delay or impair our ability to market our products.\nEntolimod is being developed to treat ARS, which is a disease that may be caused by terrorist acts. The political and social responses to terrorism have been highly charged and unpredictable. Political or social pressures may delay or cause resistance to bringing our products to market or limit pricing of our products, which would harm our business. Changes to favorable laws, such as the Project BioShield Act, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue and could require us to reduce the scope of or discontinue our operations. We announced in September 2015 that we received two awards from the DoD for the further development of entolimod. We hope to receive additional funding in the future from U.S. or foreign government agencies for the development of entolimod and our other products. Changes in government budgets and agendas, however, have previously resulted in termination of our contract negotiations and may, in the future, result in future funding being decreased and de-prioritized. In addition, government contracts contain provisions that permit cancellation in the event that funds are unavailable to the government agency. Furthermore, we cannot be certain of the timing of any future funding and substantial delays or cancellations of funding could result from protests or challenges from third parties. If the U.S. government fails to continue to adequately fund R&D programs, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to continue development of entolimod or continue our other operation. Similarly, if our pre-EUA submission for entolimod is authorized by the FDA, but the U.S. government does not place sufficient orders for this product, our future business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, are not subject to these prohibitions. Furthermore, foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may have laws that are similar to the FCPA to which we are or may become subject. This may place us at a significant competitive disadvantage. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft, and other fraudulent practices may occur from time to time in the foreign markets where we conduct business. Although we inform our personnel that such practices are illegal, we can make no assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in illegal conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the Company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.\nCompliance with the FCPA and similar foreign anti-bribery laws is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, such anti-bribery laws present particular challenges in the biotech or pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government and doctors and other hospital employees may be considered foreign officials.\nThe recent resignation of our independent accounting firm could delay our future SEC filings and adversely affect our business.\nAs previously disclosed, on April 11, 2022, Tuner, Stone & Company, LLP (\u201cTSC\u201d) resigned as our independent registered public accounting firm, and on June 13, 2022, through and with the approval of our board of directors, we appointed BF Borgers CPA, PC (\u201cBF Borgers\u201d) as our new independent registered public accounting firm. The process of engaging and onboarding a new accounting firm can be costly and time consuming for management. Delay to our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) have occurred and may occur again in the future if we are unable to timely engage and onboard the new accounting firm. These events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or impact our ability to obtain financing.\nChanges in accounting standards, especially those that relate to management estimates and assumptions, are unpredictable and subject to interpretation by management and our independent registered public accounting firm and may materially impact how we report and record our financial condition.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Under each of these policies, it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions, using different assumptions, or as new information becomes available. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, the SEC, other regulators and our outside independent registered public accounting firm) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. BF Borgers, our new independent registered public accounting firm, may view our estimates and assumptions, or interpret policies, differently than our prior independent registered public accounting firm. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, or apply an existing standard differently (and also retroactively), resulting in a change in our results on a going forward basis or a potential restatement of historical financial results.\nWe have experienced transitions in our management team, our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm in the past and may continue to do so in the future, which could result in disruptions in our operations and harm our business.\nWe have experienced a number of transitions with respect to our board of directors, executive officers and our independent registered public accounting firm in recent quarters, including the following:\n\u25cf\nIn February 2022, Steve Barbarick resigned from his position as a member of the board of directors. In February 2022, Dr. Satish Chandran was appointed to the board of directors to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Barbarick\u2019s resignation.\n\u25cf\nIn March 2022, Randy Saluck and Lea Verny, each a member of the board of directors, resigned from their positions.\n\u25cf\nIn April 2022, TSC resigned as our independent registered public accounting firm. In June 2022, we appointed BF Borgers as our new independent registered public accounting firm.\n\u25cf\nIn April 2022, Cozette M. McAvoy resigned as Chief Legal Officer.\n\u25cf In April 2022, Taunia Markvicka was terminated as Chief Operating Officer.\n\u25cf In April 2022, Clifford Selsky was terminated as Chief Medical Officer.\n\u25cf\nIn May 2022, Peter Aronstam resigned as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. In May 2022, we appointed Christopher Zosh to act as the interim principal financial officer and interim principal accounting officer.\nWe may experience additional transitions in our board of directors and management in the future. Any such future transitions could result in disruptions in our operations and cause us to incur additional expenses and expend resources to ensure a smooth transition.\nRisks Related to Conducting Business in Russia\nPolitical, economic and governmental instability in Russia and Russian military action in the Ukraine could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nPanacela Labs, LLC, which is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Panacela, conducts business, including clinical trials, in Russia through Russian legal entities. Also, Rusnano is a Russian joint-stock company created as a private equity and venture capital vehicle by the government of Russia. Panacela Labs, LLC owns the worldwide rights to Mobilan. Rusnano has certain shareholder rights which could block our ability to execute strategic transactions such as an asset sale or licensing arrangement. All clinical development activity conducted by these Russian entities was funded by grants from the health ministry of the Russian government. Possible sanctions against Rusnano, in light of the fact that it is a Russian government fund, could have a material adverse effect on our business in that Rusnano has certain shareholder rights which could block our ability to execute strategic transactions such as an asset sale or licensing arrangement.\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military actions against Ukraine, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is likely. Impact to Ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States and other nations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, and each country\u2019s potential response to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations in Russia. As such, the current sanctions and any political, economic, or governmental instability in Russia could impact future funding, if any, by the health ministry of the Russian government, our access to trial data and our access to intellectual property for out-licensing purposes. In addition, such international sanctions and potential responses to such sanctions, including those that may limit or restrict our ability to transfer funds into Russia to pay for such clinical trial activity or any frozen or lost funds, could significantly affect our ability to pay our developers based in Russia. In such event, we would have to look to alternative development arrangements, which may delay our ability to conduct clinical trials.\nFurthermore, such international sanctions and potential responses to such sanctions, may interfere with our ability to obtain marketing approvals from the regulators in the U.S., Europe, Russia, and other jurisdictions of our product candidate Mobilan. We have also contracted with counterparties in Ukraine that perform certain clinical research and other tasks related to the development of our product candidates that are now unlikely to be completed due to disruption of the invasion. While we believe that the affected service providers can be replaced without a material impact on the costs to the Company, the quality of the results obtained or clinical trial timelines, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully in a timely manner or at all.\nWe have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the situation in Ukraine, as the conflict and governmental reactions are rapidly developing and beyond our control. Prolonged unrest, intensified military activities or more extensive sanctions impacting the region could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and business outlook.\nWe have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, including intercompany transactions outside the U.S. In addition, some currencies may be subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies, which can limit our ability to otherwise react to rapid foreign currency devaluations. Because it has operations in Russia, our exchange rate risk is highly sensitive to the prevailing value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Russian ruble, which exchange rates may fluctuate significantly, in particular due to the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as continued and any new sanctions against Russia. We are subject to exchange rate fluctuations if it or one of our subsidiaries exchanges one currency into another, in order to conduct cross-border operations, and as we translate ruble denominated assets and liabilities that fluctuate from period-to-period. The former results in a transaction gain/loss that is reflected in our operating results. The latter results in a translation gain/loss reflected in other comprehensive income/loss in equity. Additionally, translation of historical operating results at average exchange rates for respective periods of time will also generate foreign currency translation adjustments that are reflected in our operating results. Presently, Panacela conducts most of our activities in Russia. As such we expect most of the foreign currency fluctuations to be related to accounting translations, versus transaction gains and losses. While we cannot predict with precision the effect of future exchange-rate fluctuations, any significant rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe legal system in Russia can create an uncertain environment for business activity, which could materially adversely affect our business and operations in Russia.\nThe Russian legal system can be characterized by: inconsistencies between and among laws and governmental, ministerial, and local regulations, orders, decisions, resolutions, and other acts; gaps in the regulatory structure resulting from the delay in adoption or absence of implementing regulations; selective enforcement of laws or regulations, sometimes in ways that have been perceived as being motivated by political or financial considerations; limited judicial and administrative guidance on interpreting legislation; relatively limited experience of judges and courts in interpreting recent commercial legislation; a perceived lack of judicial and prosecutorial independence from political, social and commercial forces; inadequate court system resources; a high degree of discretion on the part of the judiciary and governmental authorities; and underdeveloped bankruptcy procedures that are subject to abuse.\nGovernment authorities also have a high degree of discretion in Russia and have at times exercised their discretion selectively or arbitrarily, without hearing or prior notice, and sometimes in a manner that is perceived to be influenced, or may be influenced, by political or commercial considerations. The government also has the power, in certain circumstances, to interfere with the performance of, nullify, or terminate contracts. Selective or arbitrary actions have included withdrawal of licenses, sudden and unexpected tax audits, criminal prosecutions and civil actions. Federal and local government entities have also used common defects in documentation as pretexts for court claims and other demands to invalidate and/or to void transactions, apparently for political purposes. We cannot assure you that regulators, judicial authorities or third parties will not challenge our compliance with applicable laws, decrees and regulations in Russia. Selective or arbitrary government action could have an adverse effect on our business and on the value of our common stock.\nIn addition, as is true of civil law systems generally, judicial precedents generally have no binding effect on subsequent decisions. Not all legislation and court decisions in Russia are readily available to the public or organized in a manner that facilitates understanding. Enforcement of court orders can in practice be very difficult. All of these factors make judicial decisions difficult to predict and effective redress uncertain. Additionally, court claims and governmental prosecutions may be used in furtherance of what some perceive to be political or commercial aims.\nAny of these factors may affect our ability to enforce our rights under our contracts or to defend ourselves against claims by others, or result in our being subject to unpredictable requirements. These uncertainties also extend to property rights and the expropriation or nationalization of any of our entities, their assets or portions thereof, potentially without adequate compensation, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There is also considerable uncertainty as to whether judgments rendered by a court in any jurisdiction outside Russia would be recognized and enforced by courts in Russia, making it more difficult to enforce rights under our contracts in Russia.\nThe tax liabilities of Panacela Labs, LLC, our indirect Russian subsidiary, are subject to periodic tax inspections that may result in tax assessments, penalties and interest being claimed for prior tax periods, some of which assessments, penalties and interest charges may be levied arbitrarily and/or unpredictably. Therefore, there is a risk of a sudden imposition of arbitrary or onerous taxes on our operations in Russia, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe current global tensions that have arisen as a result of the Russian Military Action in the Ukraine and subsequent sanctions by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and other governments are likely to exacerbate the uncertainties and difficulties with the Russian legal system described in the preceding paragraphs.\nShareholder liability under Russian legislation could cause us to become liable for the obligations of our subsidiaries.\nUnder Russian law, we may become liable for the obligations of our Russian subsidiary if it was determined that: (i) we had the ability to make, or exert influence on, decisions for such subsidiaries as a result of our equity interest, the terms of a binding contract with such Russian subsidiary or in any other way; and (ii) our Russian subsidiary concluded the transaction giving rise to the obligations pursuant to the Company's instructions or consent. In addition, we may have secondary liability for the obligations of our Russian subsidiary in a situation where it becomes insolvent or bankrupt and this was a result of, or was otherwise attributable to, actions of the Company. This type of liability could result in significant losses, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial position.\nAccordingly, in the Company\u2019s position as an indirect parent of a Russian subsidiary, there is a risk that it could be held liable in certain limited circumstances for the debts of our effective subsidiary. If this liability is significant, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or our results of operations.\nOur Russian operating entity can be forced into liquidation on the basis of formal noncompliance with certain legal requirements.\nPanacela Labs, LLC was organized under the laws of Russia. Certain provisions of Russian law may allow a court to order the liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation, reorganization, or during its operations. Additionally, Russian corporate law allows the government to liquidate a company if its net assets fall below a certain threshold. Similarly, there have also been cases in Russia in which formal deficiencies in the establishment process of a legal entity or noncompliance with provisions of law have been used by courts as a basis for liquidation of a legal entity. Weaknesses in the legal systems of Russia create an uncertain legal environment, which makes the decisions of a court or a governmental authority difficult, if not impossible, to predict. If involuntary liquidation of Panacela Labs, LLC were to occur, such liquidation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Securities\nOur largest stockholder has the potential to significantly influence our business, which may be disadvantageous to other stockholders.\nAs of August 31, 2022, Mr. David Davidovich, a venture capital investor, beneficially owns or controls approximately 13% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result of his being the single largest holder of the voting power of our outstanding common stock and the fact that much of the remaining voting power of Statera is held diffusely among a larger number of retail investors who are historically less likely to participate in stockholder meetings, Mr. Davidovich has the potential to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. Mr. Davidovich may have interests that are different from those of other stockholders and may vote in a way with which other stockholders disagree and that may be adverse to other stockholders\u2019 interests.\nThe price of our common stock has been and could remain volatile, which may in turn expose us to securities litigation.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. From January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, the market price of our common stock, which is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, fluctuated from a high of $9.55 per share in the first quarter of 2021 to a low of $0.57 in the first quarter of 2020. The listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent, and liquid trading market will exist, and in recent years, the market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many smaller companies like us. Our common stock is thus subject to this volatility in addition to volatility caused by the occurrence of industry and company specific events. Factors that could cause fluctuations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour progress in developing and commercializing our products;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory status of our product candidates, including results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nstatus of contract and funding negotiations relating to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nevents affecting our collaborators;\n\u2022\nevents affecting our competitors\u037e\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products or technologies, commercial relationships or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe recent COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and other countries;\n\u2022\nfailure of our common stock to be listed or quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market, another national market system, or any national stock exchange;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\ndiscussion of us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the stock price of companies listed on the NASDAQ, and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.\nAs a result of the volatility of our stock price, we could be subject to securities litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and company resources from our business.\nWe have in the past failed, and currently fail, to satisfy certain continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and could fail to satisfy those requirements again in the future, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock, our liquidity and our ability to raise capital. Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nCurrently, our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market. During 2019 and 2020, the Company received notifications from Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"NASDAQ\") informing us of certain listing deficiencies related to the minimum bid price listing requirements, which led to the issuance of delisting notices. On March 23, 2022, we received written notice from NASDAQ's Listing Qualifications staff notifying us that for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, our common stock did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share (\u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d) as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notice had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock, and our common stock continues to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cSTAB\u201d.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until September 19, 2022, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Compliance will be achieved automatically and without further action when the closing bid price of our common stock is at or above $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time during the 180-day compliance period, in which case NASDAQ will notify us of our compliance and the matter will be closed.\nIf, however, we do not achieve compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by September 19, 2022, we may be eligible for additional time to comply. In order to be eligible for such additional time, we will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and we must notify NASDAQ in writing of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. There can be no guarantee that we will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, that we will maintain compliance with other NASDAQ Listing Rules, or that we will be eligible for a second compliance period.\nIn order to regain compliance, we intend to obtain approval of our board of directors and shareholders of (i) a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and, possibly, (ii) an increase of our authorized number of shares of common stock. Even if the Company obtains approval and regain compliance, it is possible that it could fall out of compliance again in the future.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Capital Market or fail to secure a second compliance period, NASDAQ may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ's listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ Minimum Bid Price Requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ's listing requirements.\nOn August 17, 2022, we received written notice from NASDAQ notifying us that we are delinquent due to the failure to file our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2022. NASDAQ has provided an exception to allow us to regain compliance with all delinquent filings by October 17, 2022. In order to regain compliance, we intend to file our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2022 by October 17, 2022.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq and the price of our common stock remains below $5.00 per share, our common stock would come within the definition of \"penny stock\".\nTransactions in securities that are traded in the United States that are not traded on NASDAQ or on other securities exchanges by companies, with net tangible assets of $5,000,000 or less and a market price per share of less than $5.00, may be subject to the \"penny stock\" rules. The market price of Statera\u2019s common stock is currently less than $5.00 per share. If our common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ and the price of our common stock remains below $5.00 per share and our net tangible assets remain $5,000,000 or less, our common stock would come within the definition of \"penny stock\".\nUnder these penny stock rules, broker-dealers that recommend such securities to persons other than institutional accredited investors:\n\u25cf\nmust make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser;\n\u25cf\nreceive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to a transaction prior to sale;\n\u25cf\nprovide the purchaser with risk disclosure documents which identify risks associated with investing in \"penny stocks\" and which describe the market for these \"penny stocks\" as well as a purchaser\u2019s legal remedies; and\n\u25cf\nobtain a signed and dated acknowledgment from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser has actually received the required risk disclosure document before a transaction in a \"penny stock\" can be completed.\nAs a result of these requirements, if our common stock is at such time subject to the \"penny stock\" rules, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effectuate customer transactions and trading activity in these shares in the United States may be significantly limited. Accordingly, the market price of the shares may be depressed, and investors may find it more difficult to sell the shares.\nIssuance of additional equity may adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nWe are currently authorized to issue 150,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of August 31, 51,141,362 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 33,208,944 shares of our common stock at an average exercise price of $0.76 per share, 567,640 restricted stock units outstanding that vest over the next 34 months, and options to purchase 1,234,527 shares of our common stock at an average exercise price of $0.44 per share. To the extent we issue shares of common stock or our outstanding options, restricted stock units and warrants are exercised, holders of our common stock will experience dilution.\nIn the event of any other future issuances of equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, common stock, holders of our common stock may experience dilution. Furthermore, certain of our outstanding warrants contain provisions that, in certain circumstances, could result in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such securities to increase and/or the exercise price of such warrants to decrease.\nMoreover, our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve, or wind up our business and other terms. If we issue shares of preferred stock in the future that have preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decrease. Additionally, the conversion of any preferred stock issued in the future into our common stock could result in significant dilution to the holders of our common stock.\nThe eventual public resale by certain of our significant stockholders could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nIn July 2015, we issued an aggregate of 6,716,163 shares of our Company\u2019s common stock to Mr. Davidovich and Rusnano. The issuances of these shares were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and the shares are only able to be resold pursuant to a separate registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration (under both federal and state securities laws). Contractual restrictions prohibiting Mr. Davidovich from selling his shares have expired and pursuant to the terms of registration rights agreements entered into between the Company and each of Mr. Davidovich and Rusnano, we have filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to register the public offer and resale of the shares held by these stockholders. The registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC and Mr. Davidovich and Rusnano are each able to freely sell some or all of their shares of our Company\u2019s common stock. If all or a substantial portion of these shares are resold into the public markets under such registration statement or otherwise, such transactions may cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nWe also consider from time to time various strategic alternatives that could involve issuances of additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock, including but not limited to acquisitions and business combinations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these reports and we currently do not have any industry analysts covering us. In the event we do regain analyst coverage, there can be no assurance that analysts will provide favorable coverage. Our stock price may be adversely impacted by our current lack of analyst coverage as we may have less visibility in the financial markets than other companies in our industry, which may cause declined trading volume and stock price.\nOur operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond our control.\nOur operations are subject to the risk of disruption by hurricanes, severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, earthquakes and other natural disasters, accidents, fire, power shortages, geopolitical unrest, war and other military action, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, public health issues, epidemics or pandemics (including, for example, the recent novel coronavirus outbreak), and other events, such as raw material or supply scarcity, that are beyond our control and the control of the third parties on which we depend. Any of these catastrophic events, whether in the United States or abroad, may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, our employees, facilities, suppliers, or potential customers and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 91395, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CBLI"}
