COVID-19 has led governments and other authorities around the world to implement significant measures intended to control the spread of the virus, including social distancing measures, business closures or restrictions on operations, quarantines and travel bans. While some of these restrictions have been lifted or eased in many jurisdictions as the rates of COVID-19 infections have decreased or stabilized and various COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed, a resurgence of COVID-19 and the impact of variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 in some markets has slowed the reopening process, could halt or reverse the reopening process, or result in the reinstatement of social distancing measures, business closures, restrictions on operations, quarantines and travel bans. Additionally, on November 4, 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued a COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing Emergency Temporary Standard requiring all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or tests for COVID-19 on at least a weekly basis. The OSHA rule also requires that these employers provide paid time for employees to get vaccinated, and ensure all unvaccinated workers wear a face mask in the workplace. While the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the OSHA rule in January 2022, it is not currently possible to predict with any certainty whether the stay will be lifted, the exact impact the new regulation would have on our company, suppliers and customers. As a company with more than 100 employees, under the OSHA rule, we would be required to mandate COVID-19 vaccination of our workforce or require our unvaccinated employees to be tested weekly. Some employers, including the Company, already have implemented requirements for workers regarding vaccination status, testing, and/or other measures in response to COVID-19. The Company has required compliance with its COVID-19 vaccination policy since October 31, 2021 for all California based employees, and December 31, 2021 for all other U.S. based employees, subject to any special exceptions or other approved reasonable accommodations. This policy and the OSHA standard could result in employee attrition, difficulty securing future labor and supply needs and may have an adverse effect on future profit margins.\nEven if not required by governments and other authorities, companies are continuing to take various safety precautions, such as requiring employees to be vaccinated, employees to work remotely, imposing travel restrictions, reducing operating hours, imposing operating restrictions and temporarily closing businesses. These continuing restrictions, and future prevention and mitigation measures, imposed by governments and companies, are likely to continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions and consumer confidence and spending (including as a result of lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic), which has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on the demand for our products, particularly in our foodservice channel, and could materially adversely affect the supply of our products. Sustained market turmoil and business disruption due to COVID-19 have negatively impacted and are expected to continue to negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our foodservice channel\nCOVID-19 has impacted business operations and customer and consumer demand in our foodservice channel as restaurants and other foodservice locations have been required to temporarily close or restrict indoor dining to limit the spread of COVID-19 or because of labor shortages. Although certain of these restrictions were lifted pursuant to multi-step reopening plans and exceptions to allow for carry-out and delivery have enabled certain of our customers to continue to generate business, we experienced a significant deterioration in sales to foodservice customers in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, foodservice channel net revenues were $139.9 million compared to $106.2 million in the prior year. Although our foodservice channel net revenues showed recovery in the year ended December 31, 2021 from the severely depressed\nlevels seen in the prior-year period, there is uncertainty related to the COVID-19 infection rates, as well as the reimplementation of safety measures in certain jurisdictions, and potential impact on customer demand levels. We expect to also continue to be impacted by decreased customer and consumer demand as a result of event cancellations and social distancing, government-imposed restrictions on public gatherings and businesses, and temporary restaurant and retail store closures and operating restrictions. Closures or scaled back operations have also resulted in delays in tests or launches of our products among our foodservice customers.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our retail channel\nWhile we initially experienced an increase in retail demand during the second quarter of 2020 as consumers shifted toward more at-home consumption as a result of the pandemic, the level of retail demand meaningfully slowed during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and continued into 2021. For example, for the second quarter ended July 3, 2021, we generated retail channel net revenues of $105.7 million, compared to $73.8 million in the third quarter ended October 2, 2021, and $64.3 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. The continuing impact of COVID-19 remains highly uncertain. It is, therefore, difficult to predict retail demand levels going forward, including as a result of foodservice establishments opening and potentially offsetting retail demand. Additionally, we could suffer product inventory losses or markdowns and lost revenue in the event of the loss or a shutdown of a major supplier, co-manufacturer or distributor, disruption of our distribution network, or decreased consumer confidence and spending, including because of labor shortages. We also have been providing heavier discounting on some of our products in response to COVID-19 and increased competition. Although these actions are intended to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products, they have and are likely to continue to have a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our suppliers, co-manufacturers and distributors\nWe source ingredients from multiple suppliers around the world. Currently, the principal ingredient in most of our products is pea protein. In 2020, we scaled back our production in response to COVID-19 and to reduce our existing finished goods and work in process inventory levels, and saw an increase in our pea protein stocks. However, in light of the expected shelf life of our pea protein raw materials, we do not believe there is a risk of inventory obsolescence of these raw materials at this time. The impact of COVID-19 on any of our suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors or transportation or logistics providers, including problems with their respective businesses, finances, labor matters (including illness or absenteeism in workforce, or effects of government or employer vaccine mandates), ability to import raw materials, product quality issues, costs, production, insurance and reputation, may negatively affect the price and availability of our ingredients and/or packaging materials and impact our supply chain. In addition, if the disruptions caused by COVID-19 continue or there are additional resurgences of COVID-19 and the appearance of more virulent variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, our ability to meet the demands of our customers may be materially impacted.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our manufacturing operations and workforce\nWe have implemented and continue to practice a series of physical distancing and hygienic practices at our manufacturing and other facilities. If we are forced to scale back hours of production or close these facilities in response to the pandemic, we expect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would be materially adversely affected. Beginning in October 2021, we began requiring headquarters-based employees to return to working in the office. In the event that an employee tests positive for COVID-19, we may have to temporarily close one or more of our facilities for cleaning and/or quarantine one or more employees, which could negatively impact our operations and financial results. We have incurred and may be required to continue to incur for an indeterminable period, increased costs related to sanitizing the work environment and overall increased safety measures. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our international expansion and access to capital\nPart of our growth strategy includes increasing the number of international customers and expanding into additional geographies. For example, in the second quarter of 2021, our manufacturing facility in Europe located in Enschede, the Netherlands, completed commercial trial runs for dry blend production and completed commercial trial runs for our extruded product in the third quarter of 2021. As of the end of 2021, this facility is fully operational, manufacturing our extruded product and dry blends that go into making our finished goods.\nAlso in the second quarter of 2021, several commercial trials of certain of our manufacturing processes were completed in our new end-to-end manufacturing facility in the Jiaxing Economic & Technological Development Zone near Shanghai. In the third quarter of 2021, the facility successfully completed the qualification of extrusion production capabilities and in the fourth quarter of 2021, the facility successfully completed the international Food Safety System Certification (FSSC) 22000 and ISA Halal certification. The facility completed commercialization of end-to-end production at the end of 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we also leased a 12,100 square foot facility in Shanghai, which will be used as a local research and development facility to support our local manufacturing operations. The timing and success of our ongoing international expansion efforts may be negatively impacted by COVID-19, which could impede our anticipated growth.\nWe may be subject to special COVID-19 related requirements, restrictions and testing, including those applicable to cold-chain food distribution, when our products or ingredients are imported into or circulated through Mainland China. If we do not comply with these requirements and/or our product tests positive for coronavirus, our ability to import or distribute our product may be negatively impacted and may result in recalls, administrative fines and civil liability, particularly if the problem results in sickness or injury.\nAdditionally, COVID-19 has created significant disruptions in the credit and financial markets, which could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all.\nThe extent of COVID-19\u2019s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic (including any additional resurgences), impact of variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, the wide distribution and public acceptance of the various COVID-19 vaccines and their efficacy against COVID-19 and variants of the virus, labor needs at the Company as well as in the supply chain and at customers, compliance with government or employer COVID-19 vaccine mandates and the resulting impact on available labor, the level of social and economic restrictions imposed in the United States and abroad in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, and the impact on consumer behavior, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. Furthermore, the uncertainty created by COVID-19 significantly increases the difficulty in forecasting operating results and strategic planning. As a result, it is not currently possible to ascertain the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. However, COVID-19 has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and may adversely impact the trading price of our common stock. While the ultimate health and economic impact of COVID-19 continues to be highly uncertain, our business operations and results of operations, including our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin, earnings and cash flows, may be adversely impacted in 2022. Future events and effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be determined with precision and actual results could significantly differ from estimates or forecasts. The impact of COVID-19 may also heighten other risks discussed in this report.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have experienced net losses in almost every period since our inception. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of $182.1 million, $52.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively. Although we anticipate a moderation of growth in our operating expenses in 2022, over time we expect that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will continue to increase as we hire additional employees; support our strategic and other QSR customer relationships; innovate and commercialize products; build our brand, expand our marketing channels and drive consumer adoption of our products; continue to invest to expand our production capacity\nthrough our own internal production facilities, domestically and abroad; build out our campus headquarters and manufacturing facilities; increase our customer base, supplier network and co-manufacturing partners; scale production across distribution channels; pursue geographic expansion; and enhance our technology and production capabilities. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. We incur significant expenses in developing our innovative products, building out our facilities, securing an adequate supply of raw materials, obtaining and storing ingredients and other products and marketing the products we offer. In addition, many of our expenses, including some of the costs associated with our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, are fixed. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability, and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Such factors noted above or other factors could result in the contraction of our business and the implementation of significant cost cutting measures, including certain restructuring actions to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies to better align our operating expenses with our revenue, reduce our headcount and other expenditures, which could result in disruptions to our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to effectively expand our manufacturing and production capacity, accurately forecast demand for our products or quickly respond to forecast changes, our business and operating results and our brand reputation could be harmed.\nIf we do not have sufficient capacity to meet our customers\u2019 demands and to satisfy increased demand, or are not able to streamline and optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products, we will need to expand our operations, supply and manufacturing capabilities. However, there is risk in our ability to effectively scale production processes, optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products and effectively manage our supply chain requirements. We must accurately forecast demand for each of our products and inventory needs in order to ensure we have adequate available manufacturing capacity for each such product and to ensure we are effectively managing our inventory. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions which may cause our estimates to be inaccurate and affect our ability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity (whether our own manufacturing capacity or co-manufacturing capacity) and adequate inventory supply in order to meet the demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and harm our brand and our business and in some cases may result in fines or indemnification obligations we must pay customers or distributors if we are unable to fulfill orders placed by them in a timely manner or at all.\nHowever, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity or inventory, we may have significantly underutilized assets, experience reduced margins, and have excess inventory which we may be required to write-down or write-off. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities and inventory supply with demand, if we experience disruptions or delays in our supply chain, or if we cannot obtain raw materials of sufficient quantity and quality at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations.\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance and our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our products, increasing competition from our market competitors and new market entrants, and a decrease in the growth of our overall market. If we are unable to identify and execute cost-down initiatives intended to achieve price parity with animal protein, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market, demand for our products may slow and could adversely affect our revenues and margins. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer.\nWe estimate market opportunity and forecast market growth that may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nOur estimates of market opportunity and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. The factors that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time and may be variable or inaccurate and may be affected by increasing competition from our market competitors and new market entrants. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost and perceived value associated with our product and those of our competitors. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecast, our business could fail to grow at the rate we anticipate, if at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties.\nBecause we rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers, we may not be able to obtain raw materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities at competitive prices to produce our products or meet the demand for our products.\nWe rely on a limited number of vendors, a portion of which are located internationally, to supply us with raw materials. Our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to arrange for the purchase of raw materials in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have entered into a multi-year sales agreement for plant-based protein with one of our pea protein suppliers pursuant to which we are required to purchase specified minimum monthly and semi-annual quantities through the term. In addition, we have entered into a supply agreement with another supplier pursuant to which we obtain pea protein on a purchase order basis and have the right to cancel purchase orders if we provide timely written notice. The amount purchased in each quarter of 2022 is mutually agreed upon by us and the supplier prior to each quarter and becomes a binding quarterly commitment upon such agreement. Other than pursuant to these agreements, we are not assured of continued supply or pricing of raw materials. Any of our other suppliers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationship with us. We have in the past experienced interruptions in the supply of pea protein from one supplier that resulted in delays in delivery to us. We could experience similar delays in the future from any of our suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of pea protein or other raw materials would have a material adverse effect on our business if we cannot replace these suppliers in a timely manner, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, our pea protein suppliers manufacture their products at a limited number of facilities. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage or other calamity affecting any of these facilities, or any interruption in their operations, could negatively impact our ability to obtain required quantities of pea protein in a timely manner, or at all, which could materially reduce our product sales and net revenues, and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nEvents that adversely affect our suppliers of pea protein and other raw materials could impair our ability to obtain raw material inventory in the quantities at competitive prices that we desire. Such events include problems with our suppliers\u2019 businesses, finances, labor relations and/or shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, ability to import raw materials, product quality issues, costs, production, insurance and reputation, as well as local economic and political conditions, restrictive U.S. and foreign governmental actions, such as restrictions on transfers of funds and trade protection measures, including export/import duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, fires, earthquakes, flooding, severe weather, agricultural diseases or other catastrophic occurrences. We continuously seek alternative sources of protein to use in our products, but we may not be successful in diversifying the raw materials we use in our products.\nIf we need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that supplies of raw materials will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all, or that a new supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our strict quality standards. If\nwe are unable to manage our supply chain effectively and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, our operating costs could increase and our profit margins could decrease.\nDisruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nOur ability to make, move and sell products in coordination with our suppliers, third party contract manufacturers and distributors is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from severe weather, fires or evacuations related thereto, natural disasters, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, agricultural diseases, cyber incidents, terrorism, governmental restrictions or mandates, political instability, trade restrictions, import restrictions, border closures, freight carrier availability, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers and carriers, repairs or enhancements at facilities manufacturing or delivering our products or other reasons could impair our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. To the extent we are unable to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nOur future business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by reduced or limited availability of plant-based protein that meets our standards.\nOur ability to ensure a continuing supply of ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, such as the number and size of farms that grow certain crops such as Canadian, European and North American yellow peas, the vagaries of these farming businesses (including poor harvests impacting the quality of the peas grown), changes in national and world economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19 or the outbreak of hostilities or war, tariffs and our ability to forecast our ingredient requirements. The high-quality ingredients used in many of our products are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes, hurricanes and pestilence. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can lower crop yields and reduce crop size and quality, which in turn could reduce the available supply of, or increase the price of, quality ingredients. In addition, we purchase some ingredients and other materials offshore, and the price and availability of such ingredients and materials may be affected by political events or other conditions in these countries or tariffs, trade wars or the outbreak of hostilities or war. We also compete with other food producers in the procurement of ingredients, and this competition may increase in the future if consumer demand for plant-based protein products increases. If supplies of quality ingredients are reduced or there is greater demand for such ingredients from us and others, we may not be able to obtain sufficient supply that meets our strict quality standards on favorable terms, or at all, which could impact our ability to supply products and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of distributors, and if we experience the loss of one or more distributors and cannot replace them in a timely manner, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMany retailers and foodservice providers purchase our products through distributors who purchase, store, sell, and deliver our products to such retailers and foodservice providers. For 2021, two distributors accounted for more than 10% of our gross revenues. For 2021, DOT and Zandbergen WFM accounted for approximately 12% and 11% of our gross revenues, respectively. Since these distributors act as intermediaries between us and the retailers and foodservice providers, we do not have short-term or long-term commitments or minimum purchase volumes in our contracts with them that ensure future sales of our products. If we lose one or more of our distributors and cannot replace the distributor in a timely manner or at all, our business, results of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively acquire new customers or retain our existing customers, or if we fail to derive revenue from our existing customers consistent with our historical performance, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success, and our ability to increase revenues and operate profitably, depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers, to retain existing customers, and to keep existing customers engaged so that they continue to purchase products from us. We intend to continue to expand our number of foodservice customers, both in the United States and internationally, as part of our growth strategy. This may require us to provide marketing and other financial incentives to our customers to assist in the promotion of our products. Such additional incentives could have a negative impact on gross margin and may not necessarily result in increased sales. In addition, new national foodservice customers will often initially add certain of our product offerings to their menus at limited locations and/or on a limited test basis, after which time these customers may choose to no longer offer our products or may ultimately scale back subsequent expansions. If we fail to attract and retain new foodservice customers, or retain our existing foodservice customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, timing of retail shelf resets are not within our control, and to the extent that retail customers change the timing of such events, reduce our in store-displays or are not able to restock our products effectively, sales of our products may be impaired and negatively impact our revenues.\nFurther, if customers do not perceive our product offerings to be of sufficient value and quality, or if we fail to offer new and relevant product offerings at a competitive price, we may not be able to attract or retain customers or engage existing customers so that they continue to purchase products from us. We may lose customers to our competitors if they offer superior products to ours, if we are unable to compete on the basis of value and taste, if we are unable to meet customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner, or if we are unable to identify and execute cost-down initiatives intended to achieve price parity with animal protein in at least one of our product categories by the end of 2024. The loss of any large customer or the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of business from such customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nConsolidation of customers or the loss of a significant customer could negatively impact our sales and profitability.\nSupermarkets in North America and the European Union continue to consolidate. This consolidation has produced larger, more sophisticated organizations with increased negotiating and buying power that are able to resist price increases, as well as operate with lower inventories, decrease the number of brands that they carry and increase their emphasis on private label products, all of which could negatively impact our business. The consolidation of retail customers also increases the risk that a significant adverse impact on their business could have a corresponding material adverse impact on our business.\nIn 2021, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross revenues. The loss of any large customer, the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of any business from a large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profitability.\nFurthermore, as retailers consolidate, they may reduce the number of branded products they offer in order to accommodate private label products and generate more competitive terms from branded suppliers competing for limited retailer shelf space. Consequently, our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the actions of one or more significant retailers. A retailer may take actions that affect us for reasons that we cannot always anticipate or control, such as their financial condition, changes in their business strategy or operations, the introduction of competing products, pricing and promotions, shelf reset timing and activity, reduced in store-displays, timing of product restocking or the perceived quality of our products. Despite operating in different channels, our retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers as our foodservice channel. Because of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition, retailers may take actions that negatively affect us.\nLoss of one or more of our co-manufacturers or our failure to timely identify and establish relationships with new co-manufacturers could harm our business and impede our growth.\nA significant amount of our revenue is derived from products manufactured at manufacturing facilities owned and operated by our co-manufacturers, a portion of which are located internationally. Any of the co-manufacturers with whom we do not have a written contract could seek to alter or terminate its relationship with us at any time, leaving us with periods during which we have limited or no ability to manufacture our products. If we need to replace a co-manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional capacity will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAn interruption in, or the loss of operations at, one or more of our co-manufacturing facilities, which may be caused by work stoppages, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, production disruptions, product quality issues, local economic and political conditions, restrictive governmental actions, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), the outbreak of hostilities, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, severe weather, flooding or other natural disasters at one or more of these facilities, could delay, postpone or reduce production of some of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition until such time as such interruption is resolved or an alternate source of production is secured.\nWe believe there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-manufacturers in the industry that meet our strict quality and control standards, and as we seek to continue to obtain additional or alternative co-manufacturing arrangements in the future, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, as we expand our operations internationally, we will need to develop relationships with co-manufacturers overseas to meet sales demand, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so. Therefore, the loss of one or more co-manufacturers, any disruption or delay at a co-manufacturer or any failure to identify and engage co-manufacturers for new products, product extensions and expanded operations could delay, postpone or reduce production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny damage or disruption at our domestic or international manufacturing facilities may harm our business.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in the United States, China and the Netherlands to produce our woven proteins and our finished goods. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, outbreaks of pandemics or contagious diseases (such as COVID-19) or other calamity at any of these facilities would significantly disrupt our ability to deliver our products and operate our business. If any material amount of our machinery or inventory were damaged, we would be unable to meet our contractual obligations and cannot predict when, if at all, we could replace or repair such machinery, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not successfully ramp up operations at our facilities or these facilities may not operate in accordance with our expectations. Moreover, we face competition for employees and may be unable to hire and retain employees at these facilities.\nSince June 2018, we have acquired facilities by purchase or lease in the United States, China and the Netherlands. Any substantial delay in bringing these facilities up to full production on our current schedule may hinder our ability to produce all of the product needed to meet orders and/or achieve our expected financial performance. Opening these facilities has required, and will continue to require, additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which has and will continue to divert resources from our existing business or operations. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. Additionally, our inability to hire and retain skilled employees at these facilities will severely hamper our expansion plans, product development and manufacturing efforts. The unemployment rate in the\nColumbia, Missouri market was 2.2% as of December 2021 and labor market conditions remain relatively tight. As a result, we currently rely on temporary workers in addition to full-time employees, and in the future, we may be unable to attract and retain employees with the skills we require, which could impact our ability to expand our operations. Even if our facilities are brought up to full production according to our current schedule, it may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive.\nOur facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products is costly to replace or repair and may require substantial lead-time to do so. For example, our estimate of throughput or our extrusion capacity may be impacted by disruption from extruder lead-in time, calibration, maintenance and unexpected delays. In addition, our ability to procure new extruders may face more lengthy lead times than is typical. We may also not be able to find suitable alternatives with co-manufacturers to replace the output from such equipment on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. In the future, we may also experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production because of regulatory issues, equipment failure, delays in raw material deliveries or COVID-19 outbreaks. Any such disruption or unanticipated event may cause significant interruptions or delays in our business and the reduction or loss of inventory may render us unable to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. We have property and business disruption insurance in place for all of our manufacturing facilities; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf we fail to manage any future growth effectively, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have grown rapidly since inception. For example, our net revenues increased from $16.2 million in 2016 to $464.7 million in 2021. Our full-time employee count as of December 31, 2021 (including contract workers) has grown approximately ten-fold since December 31, 2016. This growth has placed significant demands on our management, financial, operational, technological and other resources. The anticipated growth and expansion of our business and our product offerings will continue to place significant demands on our management and operations teams and require significant additional resources to meet our needs, which may not be available in a cost-effective manner, or at all. If we do not effectively manage our anticipated growth, we may not be able to execute on our business plan, respond to competitive pressures, take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements or maintain high-quality product offerings, any of which could harm our business, brand, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations in other countries, including into those in which we have no prior operating experience.\nWe intend to continue to expand our global footprint and enter into new markets. International operations involve a number of risks, including labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, foreign regulatory compliance, tariffs, taxes and exchange controls, economic downturns, inflation, foreign currency fluctuations and political and social instability in the countries in which we operate. Expansion may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate. It may also involve expanding into less developed countries, which may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems. In addition, it may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in these new geographic markets. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. As we expand our business into other countries, we may encounter regulatory, legal, personnel, technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses and/or delay our ability to become profitable in such countries, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and brand.\nOur revenue growth rate may slow over time and may not be indicative of future performance.\nOur revenue growth rates may slow over time due to a number of reasons, including the impact of COVID-19, increasing competition, market saturation, slowing demand for our offerings, increasing regulatory costs and challenges, and failure to capitalize on growth opportunities.\nOur revenues and earnings may fluctuate as a result of our promotional activities.\nWe routinely offer sales discounts and promotions through various programs to customers and consumers which may result in reduced margins. These programs include rebates, temporary on-shelf price reductions, off-invoice discounts, retailer advertisements, product coupons and other trade activities. We anticipate that we will need to continue to offer more trade and promotion discounts to both our retail and foodservice customers, to drive increased consumer trial, in response to COVID-19 and in response to increased competition. We expect to face increasing competition across all channels, especially as additional plant-based protein product brands continue to enter the marketplace. In response, we anticipate providing heavier discounting and promotions on some of our products. Although these actions are intended to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products, they have had and are likely to continue to have a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results.\nFluctuations in our results of operations for our second and third quarters may impact, and may have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations. Generally, we expect to experience greater demand for certain of our products during the summer grilling season. We continue to see additional seasonality effects, especially within our retail channel, with revenue contribution from this channel tending to be greater in the second and third quarters of the year, along with increased levels of purchasing by customers ahead of holidays, the impact of customer shelf reset activity and the timing of product restocking by our retail customers. Any factors that harm our second and third quarter operating results, including disruptions in our supply chain, adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire year. In an environment of uncertainty from the impact of COVID-19, we are unable to assess the ultimate impact on the demand for our products as a result of seasonality.\nHistorical results are not indicative of future results.\nHistorical quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period comparisons of our sales and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period results. You should not rely on the results of a single quarter or period as an indication of our annual results or our future performance.\nFailure by our transportation providers to deliver our products on time, or at all, could result in lost sales.\nWe currently rely upon third-party transportation providers for a significant portion of our product shipments. Our utilization of delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, employee strikes, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19) and inclement weather, which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs, if at all. We periodically change shipping companies, and we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries. In addition, we could incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we receive from the third-party transportation providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our operating results.\nFailure to retain our senior management may adversely affect our operations.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued service of certain members of our senior management, including Ethan Brown, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. These executives have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of our business and for executing our growth strategy and are integral to our brand, culture and the reputation we enjoy with suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a\nnegative light by investors and analysts, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. We do not currently carry key-person life insurance for our senior executives.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain employees or maintain our company culture, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate our culture and can represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. We believe a critical component of our success has been our company culture and long-standing core values. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, or if we fail to preserve our company culture among a larger number of employees dispersed in various geographic regions, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees or key personnel changes may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our international employees are employed by professional employer organizations.\nPrior to January 1, 2022, we contracted with a professional employer organization, or U.S. PEO, that administered our human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions for our employees in the United States. Effective as of January 1, 2022, such human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions are no longer performed by the U.S. PEO. We continue to contract with non-U.S. PEOs to perform the same functions as the U.S. PEO for the majority of our employees outside the United States. Although we recruit and select our workers, each of these workers is also an employee of record of the relevant non-U.S. PEO. As a result, these workers are compensated through the relevant PEO, are governed by the work policies created by the relevant PEO and receive their annual wage statements and other payroll or labor related reports from the relevant PEO (e.g., T-4s for employees in Canada). This relationship permits management to focus on operations and profitability rather than payroll administration, but this relationship also exposes us to some risks. Among other risks, if any of the non-U.S. PEOs fail to adequately withhold or pay employer taxes or to comply with applicable laws, we may be held liable for such violations notwithstanding any indemnification provisions with the non-U.S. PEOs. In certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the worker may be deemed a direct employee and the potential liability for any non-compliance with applicable laws increases depending on whether a company has an entity or other corporate presence in the country, among other factors set forth under applicable local laws.\nCourt and administrative proceedings related to matters of employment tax, labor law and other laws applicable to PEO arrangements could distract management from our business and cause us to incur significant expense. If we were held liable for violations by PEOs, such amounts may adversely affect our profitability and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of third party service providers for the performance of several of our business operations, including payroll and human capital management services.\nIf any of these third party providers were to experience significant interruptions in their business operations, terminate their agreements with the company, or fail to perform the services required under the terms of the company\u2019s contracts with them, its own processing could be materially and adversely affected for an indefinite period of time. There can be no assurance that the company would be able to locate alternative providers of such services, or that it could do so at economical rates.\nDisruptions in the worldwide economy may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe global economy can be negatively impacted by a variety of factors such as the spread or fear of spread of contagious diseases (such as COVID-19) in locations where our products are sold, man-made or natural disasters, severe weather, actual or threatened hostilities or war, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty. Such adverse and uncertain economic conditions may impact distributor, retailer,\nfoodservice and consumer demand for our products. Furthermore, in connection with increasing tensions related to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, governments in the U.S., U.K. and the EU have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business, which could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain, our international subsidiaries, business partners or customers in the broader region, including potential destabilizing effects that such conflicts may pose for the European continent or the global oil and natural gas markets. In addition, our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, retailers, foodservice customers, consumers and creditors may suffer. Consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, change in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. In particular, consumers may reduce the amount of plant-based food products that they purchase where there are conventional animal-based protein offerings, which generally have lower retail prices. In addition, consumers may choose to purchase private label products rather than branded products because they are generally less expensive. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also result in consumers reducing the frequency and amount spent on food prepared away from home. Distributors, retailers and foodservice customers may become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing distributors, retailer and foodservice customers, our ability to attract new consumers, the financial condition of our consumers and our ability to provide products that appeal to consumers at the right price. Decreases in demand for our products without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions or uncertainty may have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability and may result in consumers making long-lasting changes to their discretionary spending behavior on a more permanent basis.\nInflationary price pressures of raw materials, labor, transportation, fuel or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, could negatively impact our profitability.\nIncreases in the price of raw materials, labor, wages or other inputs that we or our suppliers use in manufacturing and supplying products, along with logistics, transportation, shipping and other related costs, may lead to higher production and shipping costs for our products. Any increase in the cost of inputs to our production could lead to higher costs for our products in our foodservice and retail channels and could negatively impact our operating results and future profitability.\nFuture acquisitions or investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nIn the future, we may pursue acquisitions or investments that we believe will help us achieve our strategic objectives. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and even if we do, we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately achieve our goals or realize the anticipated benefits. The pursuit of acquisitions and any integration process will require significant time and resources and could divert management time and focus from operation of our then-existing business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. Any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers or consumers. An acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including disrupting our ongoing operations and subjecting us to additional liabilities, increasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities related to the acquired company or product, and the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized if, for example, we fail to successfully integrate such acquisition into our company. To pay for any such acquisitions, we would have to use cash, incur debt, or issue debt or equity securities, each of which may affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Our acquisition strategy\ncould require significant management attention, disrupt our business and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and reputation could be negatively impacted by the increased scrutiny from our stakeholders and institutional investors on ESG practices.\nThere is an increased focus from stockholders and institutional investors on corporate ESG practices. Certain stockholders use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure a company\u2019s ESG practices and decide whether to invest in their common stock or engage with them to require changes to their practices. In addition, certain influential institutional investors are also increasing their focus on ESG practices and are placing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet the standards set by these stockholders, they may choose not to invest in our common stock or if our peer companies outperform us in their ESG initiatives, potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. If we do not comply with investor or stockholder expectations and standards in connection with our ESG initiatives or are perceived to have not responded appropriately to address ESG issues within our company, our business and reputation could be negatively impacted and our share price could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Products\nFood safety and food-borne illness incidents may materially adversely affect our business by exposing us to lawsuits, product recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing our operating costs and reducing demand for our product offerings.\nSelling food for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, and there is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. Unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death related to allergens, food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents caused by products we sell, or involving our suppliers or co-manufacturers, could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or our relationships with such suppliers or co-manufacturers, or otherwise result in increased operating costs, regulatory enforcement actions or harm to our reputation. Shipment of adulterated or misbranded products, even if inadvertent, can result in criminal or civil liability. Such incidents could also expose us to product liability, negligence or other lawsuits, including consumer class action lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is more than our policy limits or not covered by our policies or not subject to insurance would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources.\nThe occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs, disruptions in supply and a reduction in our sales. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination or regulatory noncompliance, whether or not caused by our actions, could compel us, our suppliers, our distributors or our customers, depending on the circumstances, to conduct a recall in accordance with FDA regulations, comparable state laws or foreign laws such as those of the European Union and the United Kingdom. Food recalls could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time and potential loss of existing distributors or customers and a potential negative impact on our ability to attract new customers due to negative consumer experiences or because of an adverse impact on our brand and reputation. The costs of a recall could exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits.\nIn addition, food companies have been subject to targeted, large-scale tampering as well as to opportunistic, individual product tampering, and we, like any food company, could be a target for product tampering. Forms of tampering could include the introduction of foreign material, chemical contaminants and pathological organisms into consumer products as well as product substitution. FDA regulations require companies like us to analyze, prepare and implement mitigation strategies specifically to address tampering (i.e., intentional adulteration) designed to inflict widespread public health harm. If we do not adequately address the possibility, or any actual instance, of intentional adulteration, we could face possible seizure or recall of our\nproducts and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSales of the Beyond Burger contribute a significant portion of our revenue. A reduction in sales of the Beyond Burger would have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe Beyond Burger accounted for approximately 55%, 58% and 64% of our gross revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Beyond Burger is our flagship product and has historically been the focal point of our development and marketing efforts, and we believe that sales of the Beyond Burger will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues, income and cash flow for the foreseeable future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to expand production and distribution of the Beyond Burger, or that customer demand for our other existing and future products will expand to allow such products to represent a larger percentage of our revenue than they do currently. Accordingly, any factor adversely affecting sales of the Beyond Burger could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to continually innovate and successfully introduce and commercialize new products or successfully improve existing products may adversely affect our ability to continue to grow.\nA key element of our growth strategy depends on our ability to develop and market new products and improvements to our existing products that meet our standards for quality and appeal to consumer preferences. The success of our innovation and product development efforts is affected by our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in new geographic markets, the technical capability of our innovation staff in developing and testing product prototypes, including complying with applicable governmental regulations, commercialization and scale-up of new products, and the success of our management and sales and marketing teams in introducing and marketing new products. Our innovation staff members are continuously testing alternative plant-based proteins to the proteins we currently use in our products, as they seek to find additional protein options to our current ingredients that are more easily sourced, and which retain and build upon the quality and appeal of our current product offerings. Failure to develop, commercialize and market new products that appeal to consumers may lead to a decrease in our growth, sales and profitability.\nAdditionally, the development and introduction of new products requires substantial research, development and marketing expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. If we are unsuccessful in meeting our objectives with respect to new or improved products, our business could be harmed.\nConsumer preferences for our products are difficult to predict and may change, and, if we are unable to respond quickly to new trends and demands, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur business is focused on the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of a line of branded plant-based protein products as alternatives to animal-based protein products. Consumer demand could change based on a number of possible factors, including dietary habits and nutritional values, concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients and shifts in preference for various product attributes. If consumer demand for our products decreased, our business and financial condition would suffer. In addition, sales of plant-based protein or meat-alternative products are subject to evolving consumer preferences that we may not be able to accurately predict or respond to. Consumer trends that we believe favor sales of our products could change based on a number of possible factors, including a shift in preference from plant-based protein to animal-based protein products, economic factors and social trends. A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products could reduce our sales or our market share and the prestige of our brand, which would harm our business and financial condition.\nAdditionally, lobbyists supporting the meat industry have engaged in marketing campaigns in an attempt to generate negative publicity regarding our products and may continue to do so in the future. Any shift in consumer perception that our products are not healthy as a result of these campaigns could significantly reduce\nthe value of our brand and damage our business. Other types of adverse publicity concerning our business or the plant-based meat industry generally could also harm our brand, reputation and results of operations. The growing use of social and digital media over recent years has amplified the impact of such negative publicity.\nIngredient and packaging costs are volatile and may rise significantly, which may negatively impact the profitability of our business.\nWe purchase large quantities of raw materials, including ingredients derived from Canadian, European and North American yellow peas, mung beans, sunflower seeds, rice, faba beans, canola oil and coconut oil. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of cardboard, film and plastic to package our products. Costs of ingredients and packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, weather conditions, consumer demand and changes in governmental trade and agricultural programs. Volatility in the prices of raw materials and other supplies we purchase could increase our cost of sales and reduce our profitability. Moreover, we may not be able to implement price increases for our products to cover any increased costs, and any price increases we do implement may result in lower sales volumes. If we are not successful in managing our ingredient and packaging costs, if we are unable to increase our prices to cover increased costs or if such price increases reduce our sales volumes, then such increases in costs will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Brand\nWe face intense competition in our market from our competitors, including manufacturers of animal-based meat products and other brands that produce plant-based protein products, and potential competitors and new market entrants and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to compete successfully.\nOur future success depends, in large part, on our ability to implement our growth strategy of expanding supply and distribution, improving placement of our products, attracting new consumers to our brand and introducing new products and product extensions, and expanding into new geographic markets. If we fail to implement our growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful, our sales and operating results will be adversely affected. Our ability to implement this growth strategy depends, among other things, on our ability to:\n\u2022manage relationships with various suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and other third parties, and expend time and effort to integrate new suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors and customers into our fulfillment operations;\n\u2022continue to compete in retail and foodservice channels;\n\u2022secure placement in the meat case for our products;\n\u2022increase our brand recognition and expand and maintain brand loyalty;\n\u2022develop new product lines and extensions; and\n\u2022expand into new geographic markets.\nOur ability to implement our growth strategy also depends on our ability to continue to compete in the retail and foodservice channels. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Numerous brands and products compete for limited retailer shelf space, foodservice customers and consumers. In our market, competition is based on, among other things, taste, nutritional profile, ingredients, texture, ease of integration into the consumer diet, low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, high fiber and protein, lack of cholesterol, soy, gluten and GMOs, convenience, price and promotion tactics, brand awareness and loyalty among customers, media spending, product variety and packaging, access to major retailer shelf space and retail locations, access to major foodservice outlets and integration into menus, innovation and intellectual property protection on products.\nWe compete with conventional animal-protein companies such as Cargill, Hormel, JBS, Perdue Foods, Tyson and WH Group, who may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and whose animal-based products are well-accepted in the marketplace today. They may also have lower operational costs, and as a result may be able to offer conventional animal meat to customers at lower costs than plant-based meat. This could cause us to lower our prices, resulting in lower profitability or, in the alternative, cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices.\nWe also compete with other food brands, including brands affiliated with conventional animal-protein companies and other large food operators, that develop and sell plant-based protein products, including, but not limited to, Alpha Foods, Boca Foods (Kraft Heinz), Lightlife and Field Roast Grain Meat Co. (Maple Leaf Foods), Gardein (Conagra), Hungry Planet, Inc., Impossible Foods, Incogmeato/Morningstar Farms (Kellogg), Moving Mountains, Omn!pork (OmniFoods), Tofurky, Sweet Earth and Awesome Burger (Nestle\u2019 S.A.), Pure Farmland by Smithfield Foods (WH Group), Raised & Rooted (Tyson), Happy Little Plants (Hormel), Sysco\u2019s Simply Plant-Based Meatless Burger, Tattooed Chef, The Not Company OZO (Planterra Foods/JBS) and Vegetarian Butcher (Unilever), and with companies which may be more innovative, have more resources and be able to bring new products to market faster and to more quickly exploit and serve niche markets. For example, a number of U.S. and international companies are working on developing lab-grown or \u201cclean meat,\u201d an animal-protein product cultivated from cells taken from animals, which could have a similar appeal to consumers as plant-based protein products. We compete with these competitors for foodservice customers, retailer shelf space and consumers.\nGenerally, the food industry is dominated by multinational corporations with substantially greater resources and operations than us. We cannot be certain that we will successfully compete with larger competitors that have greater financial, sales and technical resources or with new competitors and market entrants. Conventional food companies may acquire our competitors or launch their own plant-based protein products, and they may be able to use their resources and scale to respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities, among other things. Retailers also market competitive products under their own private labels, which are generally sold at lower prices and compete with some of our products. Similarly, retailers could change the merchandising of our products and we may be unable to retain the placement of our products in meat cases to effectively compete with animal-protein products. Competitive pressures, new competitors and market entrants or other factors could cause us to lose market share, which may require us to lower prices, increase marketing and advertising expenditures, or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns, each of which would adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability.\nOur brand and reputation may be diminished due to real or perceived quality or health issues with our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nWe believe our consumers rely on us to provide them with high-quality plant-based protein products. Therefore, real or perceived quality or food safety concerns or failures to comply with applicable food regulations and requirements, whether or not ultimately based on fact and whether or not involving us (such as incidents involving our competitors), could cause negative publicity and reduced confidence in our company, brand or products, or the industry as a whole, which could in turn harm our reputation and sales, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we believe we have a rigorous quality control process, there can be no assurance that our products will always comply with the standards set for our products, and although we strive to keep our products free of pathogenic organisms, they may not be easily detected and cross-contamination can occur. For example, in 2017, before our products were shipped to distributors or customers, we discovered, through our quality control process, that certain of our products manufactured by a former co-manufacturer were contaminated with salmonella. There is no assurance that this health risk will always be preempted by our quality control processes.\nWe have no control over our products once purchased by consumers. Accordingly, consumers may prepare our products in a manner that is inconsistent with our directions or store our products for long periods of time, which may adversely affect the quality and safety of our products. If consumers do not perceive our products to\nbe safe or of high quality, then the value of our brand would be diminished, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nAny loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the ingredients used in our products or in the safety and quality of our products would be difficult and costly to overcome. Any such adverse effect could be exacerbated by our position in the market as a purveyor of high-quality plant-based protein products and may significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any of our products, regardless of the cause, may have a substantial and adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results.\nThe growing use of social and digital media by us, our consumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative publicity about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our sales and profits could be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain our brand, our business could suffer.\nWe have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the value of the Beyond Meat brand. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend on, among other factors, the success of our plant-based product offerings, food safety, quality assurance, marketing and merchandising efforts, the nutritional benefits provided by our products and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Any negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy, could materially adversely affect our business. Brand value is based on perceptions of subjective qualities, and any incident that erodes the loyalty of our customers, suppliers or co-manufacturers, including adverse publicity or a governmental investigation or litigation, could significantly reduce the value of our brand and significantly damage our business.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nOur international expansion into China and Europe could expose us to substantial business, regulatory, political, financial and economic risks.\nOur expansion into China and Europe could expose us to substantial risks associated with doing business in China and Europe, such as, taxation, inflation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property and financial regulations, and the outbreak of hostilities or war. Our ability to operate in China and Europe may be adversely affected by changes in, or our failure to comply with, Chinese or European laws and regulations. In addition, we are exposed to risks associated with our workforce in China and the Netherlands, including with respect to changes in employment and labor laws, which could increase our operating costs. There is also significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs.\nOur international operations are subject to the FCPA and we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws.\nThe FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making certain improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The continued expansion of our international operations could increase the risk of violations of these laws in the future. There is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with the FCPA or any other applicable anti-corruption laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws or trade control laws by the United States could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Investments\nOur manufacturing operations in China and Europe require substantial investments, for which we cannot guarantee forecasted returns.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we entered into an investment agreement and related factory leasing contract to design and develop manufacturing facilities in the Jiaxing Economic & Technological Development Zone to manufacture plant-based meat products under our Beyond Meat brand in China and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we leased a 12,100 square foot facility in Shanghai, which will be used as a local research and development facility to support our local manufacturing operations. In the second quarter of 2020, we acquired our first manufacturing facility in Europe located in Enschede, the Netherlands. Our substantial investment in China and Europe may expose us to substantial risks and, as a result, we may not realize a return on our investment. Unforeseen delays in the operations of our Chinese or European manufacturing facilities may cause us to incur additional expenses. Operating these facilities may require additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which will divert resources from our existing business or operations. Even if our new Chinese and European facilities are brought up to full production according to our current schedule, they may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive. These and other risks may result in our not realizing a return on, or losing some or all, of our planned investments in China and Europe, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and financial performance.\nOur ownership of real property is subject to all the risks inherent in an investment in real estate.\nWe have direct ownership of certain real estate properties. As is the case with any owner of real property, we are subject to potential liabilities, cost and damages arising out of owning, operating, leasing or otherwise having interests in real property. There are risks that a property may have unforeseen environmental or other hazards resulting in unexpected costs. In addition, we may not be able to expand or operate our owned facilities in the manner we desire, which could adversely impact our production and facility utilization.\nJoint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and compel us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures.\nThe nature of a joint venture requires us to share control in certain areas with unaffiliated third parties. If our joint venture partner does not fulfill its obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate in accordance with its business plan. Under such a scenario, our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be compelled to increase the level of our resources devoted to the joint venture. Also, differing views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, or failure to agree on major issues. If such differences caused a joint venture to deviate from its business plan, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property, Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology adequately, which may impact our commercial success.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. We rely on a combination of patent protection, where appropriate and available, copyrights, trade secrets and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our proprietary technology or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2021, we had two issued patents in the United States and three issued patents outside the United States (U.K., Indonesia and Australia), four pending patent applications in the United States, 13 pending international patent applications, one Patent Cooperation Treaty application and one provisional patent application.\nWe cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue from these applications, the breadth of any such patents, or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or, if applicable in the future, licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of products that we may develop. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing (in most cases 18 months after the filing of the priority application), we cannot be certain that we were the first to file on the technologies covered in several of the patent applications related to our technologies or products. Furthermore, a derivation proceeding can be provoked by a third party, or instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications.\nPatent law can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important principles remain unresolved. In the United States and in many international jurisdictions, policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents can be inconsistent and/or unclear. The U.S. Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, international courts and governments have made, and will continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective countries are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws by U.S. and international judicial bodies or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by U.S. and international legislative bodies.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, which may harm the value of our brand.\nWe believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our trademarks, including Beyond Meat, Beyond Burger, Beyond Beef, Beyond Sausage, Beyond Breakfast Sausage, Beyond Chicken, Beyond Fried Chicken, Beyond Meatballs, the Caped Steer Logo, Go Beyond, Eat What You Love, The Cookout Classic and The Future of Protein, are valuable assets that reinforce our brand and consumers\u2019 favorable perception of our products. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations and other trade secrets and copyright protection to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our continued success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property, including our trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and copyrights. We rely on confidentiality agreements and trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain of our consultants, contract workers, suppliers and independent contractors, including some of our co-manufacturers who use our formulations to manufacture our products, generally require that all information made known to them be kept strictly confidential. Nevertheless, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we attempt to protect our trade secrets, our confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. If we do not keep our trade secrets confidential, others may produce products with our recipes or formulations. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights against such parties. Further, some of our formulations have been developed by or with our suppliers and co-manufacturers. As a result, we may not be able to prevent others from using similar formulations. As we begin to expand globally as part of our growth strategy, we may face additional risks protecting our trade secrets internationally, where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States.\nWe cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights are adequate, that our intellectual property rights can be successfully defended and asserted in the future or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, our trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect our trademark rights could prevent us in the future from challenging third parties who use names and logos similar to our trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer confusion or negatively affect consumers\u2019 perception of\nour brand and products. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse outcome could subject us to liabilities, force us to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property or force us to enter into licenses with others. Any one of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the laws of certain international jurisdictions in which our products may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent third parties from infringing or otherwise misappropriating our trademark rights in such jurisdictions. Moreover, failure to obtain adequate trademark rights in these foreign jurisdictions could negatively impact our ability to expand our business and launch products in certain international markets. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized third parties that obtain the rights to our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions where we have not yet applied for trademark protections, and we may expend substantial cost to obtain those trademarks from such third parties. Any one of these occurrences could reduce our competitive position or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on information technology systems and any inadequacy, failure, interruption or security breaches of those systems may harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nWe are dependent on various information technology systems, including, but not limited to, networks, applications and outsourced services in connection with the operation of our business. A failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and loss of sales, causing our business to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, severe weather, natural disasters, systems failures, viruses and security breaches, particularly in light of many of our employees working remotely due to COVID-19. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA cybersecurity incident, other technology disruptions or failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy and the protection of data relating to individuals could negatively impact our business, our reputation and our relationships with customers.\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees, suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breaches, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Moreover, a significant subset of our office-based employee population temporarily transitioned to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may exacerbate certain of these risks due to an increase in the number of points of potential attack, such as laptops and mobile devices. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 information, private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. Further, as we pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, potentially including acquisitions, we may also be expand and improve our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with new initiatives or acquisitions, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions relating to the collection, use and security of personal information and data. Such data privacy laws, regulations and other obligations may require us to change our business practices and may negatively impact our ability to expand our business and pursue business opportunities. We may incur significant expenses to comply with the laws, regulations and other obligations that apply to us. Additionally, the privacy- and data protection-related laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to significant change. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws and regulations in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. For example, our operations are subject to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which imposes data privacy and security requirements on companies doing business in the European Union, including substantial penalties for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes similar requirements on companies handling data of California residents and creates a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for (i) violations of the CCPA and (ii) businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Additionally, in August 2021, the National People\u2019s Congress of the People's Republic of China adopted the Personal Information Protection Law (\u201cPIPL\u201d), which became effective on November 1, 2021 and provides a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information in China. Privacy- and data protection-related laws and regulations also may be interpreted and enforced inconsistently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Any actual or perceived inability to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, or other obligations could result in significant cost and liability, litigation or governmental investigations, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Lease Obligations, Indebtedness, Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nIf the build out of our new El Segundo, California corporate headquarters is delayed or incurs cost overruns, the headquarters does not operate in accordance with our expectations or occupancy rates are lower than anticipated, our business or financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOn January 14, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for an initial term of 12 years to develop and house our new corporate headquarters, lab and innovation space (\u201cHeadquarters\u201d) in El Segundo, California. Development of the Headquarters has commenced and occupancy is currently expected to take place by the third quarter of 2022. There can be no assurances that the Headquarters will be ready for occupancy on or before the expected occupancy date due to force majeure events (such as COVID-19) or the risk of delays or cost overruns inherent in construction development projects, any of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations. If we are not able to complete development of the Headquarters within the approved budget or there are significant cost overruns, our cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, it is possible that, once built, there could be unanticipated difficulties in initiating operations at the Headquarters, including, but not limited to, IT system interruptions, other infrastructure support problems or the space may prove to be less conducive to our operations than currently anticipated. These risks could all result in operational inefficiencies or similar difficulties that could prove difficult or impossible to remediate and have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we are uncertain as to the impact COVID-19 will have on our ability to timely occupy the Headquarters once construction is complete, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also uncertain as to the impact COVID-19 will have on our future space demands. If we are unable to occupy the complete Headquarters space, we may have to sublease the unoccupied portion of the Headquarters. A sublease agreement would be subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as the possibility that such agreement may not be completed on terms that are advantageous to us as we may not receive sufficiently high rental rates to cover our lease obligations which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations, and our failure to meet those obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and business.\nWe currently have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations for our corporate offices, manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, commercialization center and warehouses. We depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses, we may not be able to meet our lease obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business. Furthermore, the significant cash flow required to satisfy our financial obligations under the leases could limit our ability to incur indebtedness and make capital expenditures or other investments in our business.\nOur significant indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1.2 billion of consolidated indebtedness and other liabilities. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;\n\u2022diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the Notes; and\n\u2022placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our current or future indebtedness, including the Notes, as applicable, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our current or future indebtedness, including the Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion, and our future indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nHolders of the Notes may, subject to a limited exception, require us to repurchase their Notes following a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any. In addition, all conversions of Notes will be settled partially or entirely in cash. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash\namounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our future indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase the Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the Fundamental Change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness, which may result in that indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. If the repayment of such future indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, then we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon their conversion.\nThe accounting method for the Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.\nOur Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes do not accrete. However, special interest and additional interest may accrue on the Notes at a rate per annum not exceeding 0.50% (subject to certain exceptions) upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the failure to file certain SEC reports or to remove certain restrictive legends from the Notes. The accounting method for reflecting the Notes on our balance sheet may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition. If any of the conditions to the convertibility of the Notes is satisfied or the Notes become due within one year, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their Notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital.\nWe early adopted ASU 2020-06 to account for our Notes which eliminates the treasury stock method for convertible instruments that can be settled in whole or in part with equity and instead requires the application of the more dilutive of the \u201cif-converted\u201d method or the two-class method. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the conversion premium or spread were converted at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The conversion premium or spread would have a dilutive impact on net income per share when the average market price of the Company\u2019s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that underlie the Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap.\nWe have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock.\nIn addition, we have been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions, and in connection with any early termination event in respect of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in the indenture governing the Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us.\nCertain provisions in the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that holders of our common stock or Notes may view as favorable.\nWe may require additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, may force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product manufacturing and development, and other operations.\nSince our inception, substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the development of our three core plant-based product platforms of beef, pork and poultry, including purchases of property, plant and equipment, principally to support the development and production of our products, the build-out and equipping of our Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center, and the purchase, build-out and equipping of manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and abroad. We have and believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future as we expand into additional markets we may choose to pursue. These expenditures are expected to include costs associated with research and development, manufacturing and supply, as well as marketing and selling existing and new products. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $733.3 million. Our operating plan may change because of factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. However, the capital markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. If we cannot access the capital markets upon favorable terms or at all, it may impact our ability to achieve our goals.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the number and characteristics of any additional products or manufacturing processes we develop or acquire to serve new or existing markets;\n\u2022the expenses associated with our marketing initiatives;\n\u2022our investment in manufacturing to expand our manufacturing and production capacity;\n\u2022our investments in real property and joint ventures;\n\u2022the costs required to fund domestic and international operations and growth;\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing future products or improvements to existing products or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022any lawsuits related to our products or commenced against us, including the costs associated with our current litigation with a former co-manufacturer, or the derivative actions brought against certain of our directors and officers;\n\u2022the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022the costs associated with being a public company;\n\u2022the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and\n\u2022the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any future approved products, if any.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to:\n\u2022delay, limit, reduce or terminate our manufacturing, research and development activities or our growth and expansion plans; or\n\u2022delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to generate revenue and achieve profitability.\nRisks Related to the Environment, Climate and Weather\nA major earthquake, tsunami, tornado or other natural disaster or severe weather event could seriously disrupt our entire business.\nWe have offices, co-manufacturing and manufacturing facilities located in the United States and internationally. The impact of a major earthquake, tsunami, tornado, or other natural disaster or severe weather event at any of our facilities and overall operations is difficult to predict, but such a natural disaster or severe weather event could seriously disrupt our entire business and lead to substantial losses.\nClimate change may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as yellow peas, mung beans, sunflowers, rice, faba bean, canola oil and coconut oil. Due to climate change, we may also be subjected to decreased availability of water, deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations.\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We are in the process of upgrading our information technology systems and implementing additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures in order to keep up with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act. Additionally, the growth of our operations and our being a newly public company have created a need for additional resources within the accounting and finance functions due to the increasing need to produce timely financial information and to ensure the level of segregation of duties customary for a U.S. public company. We have hired additional resources in the accounting and finance function and continue to reassess the sufficiency of finance personnel in response to these increasing demands and expectations.\nAs a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant\ndocumentation, testing and possible remediation. We have and will continue to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404. We cannot be certain that the actions we have and will continue to take to improve our internal controls over financial reporting will be sufficient.\nAny failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nThe requirements of being a public company will require us to incur increased costs and may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act which requires, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules adopted by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, we are required to comply with certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC related to corporate governance and executive compensation, such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and proxy access. As such, we have and will continue to incur additional compliance-related expenses. Additionally, the SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance.\nStockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. We expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of\nour business. Furthermore, these rules and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage and higher self-insured retention amounts, or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Compliance Matters, Litigation and Legal Proceedings\nOur operations are subject to FDA governmental regulation and other foreign, federal, state and local regulation, and there is no assurance that we will be in compliance with all regulations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other foreign, federal, state and local authorities. Specifically, for products manufactured or sold in the United States we are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA.\nThis comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, labeling and safety of food. Under this program, the FDA requires that facilities that manufacture food products comply with a range of requirements, including hazard analysis and preventive controls regulations, current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and supplier verification requirements. Comparable regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. Our processing and manufacturing facilities, including those of our co-manufacturers, are subject to periodic inspection by foreign, federal, state and local authorities. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and rely upon, our co-manufacturers for compliance with cGMPs for the manufacturing of our products by our co-manufacturers. If we or our co-manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture products that conform to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulators, we or they may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions, which could materially impact our ability to market our products, could result in our inability to manufacture our products or our co-manufacturers\u2019 inability to continue manufacturing for us, or could result in a recall of our product that has already been distributed. In addition, we rely upon our co-manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable state, local or foreign regulatory authority determines that we or these co-manufacturers have not complied with the applicable regulatory requirements, our business may be materially impacted.\nWe seek to comply with applicable regulations through a combination of employing internal experience and expert personnel to ensure quality-assurance compliance (i.e., assuring that our products are not adulterated or misbranded) and contracting with third-party laboratories that conduct analyses of products to ensure compliance with nutrition labeling requirements and to identify any potential contaminants before distribution. Failure by us or our co-manufacturers to comply with applicable laws and regulations or maintain permits, licenses or registrations relating to our or our co-manufacturers\u2019 operations could subject us to civil remedies or penalties, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing or manufacturing of products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could result in increased operating costs resulting in a material effect on our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to international regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulations internationally where we manufacture, distribute and/or sell our products. Our products are subject to numerous food safety and other laws and regulations relating to the sourcing, manufacturing, composition and ingredients, storing, labeling, marketing, advertising and distribution of these products. For example, in early 2018, we received an inquiry from Canadian officials about the labeling and composition of products that we export to Canada. We responded promptly to that inquiry, identifying minor formulation changes that we made under Canadian regulations. If regulators determine that the labeling,\nadvertising and/or composition of any of our products is not in compliance with foreign law or regulations, or if we or our co-manufacturers otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and market products, we could be subject to civil remedies or penalties, such as fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions. The consequences of a labeling or advertising violation in China can lead not only to fines from administrative authorities but also to multiple individual consumer lawsuits for nominal damages in the hundreds of dollars each, which can be costly to defend. In addition, enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. For example, China may introduce new Food Labeling Supervision Measures that could increase restrictions and require changes to our labels. In addition, with our expanding international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, contractors or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAny changes in, or changes in the interpretation of, applicable laws, regulations or policies of the FDA or U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities that relate to the use of the word \u201cmeat\u201d or other similar words in connection with plant-based protein products could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe FDA and the USDA, state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities, such as Health Canada or the CFIA, or authorities of the U.K., the EU or the EU member states, or China, including the State Administration for Market Regulation, could take action to impact our ability to use the term \u201cmeat\u201d or similar words (such as \u201cbeef,\u201d \u201cburger\u201d or \u201csausage,\u201d including the Beyond Meat logo of the Caped Longhorn superhero) to describe or advertise our products. In addition, a food may be deemed misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular way, and the FDA, CFIA, EU member state authorities or other regulators could interpret the use of the term \u201cmeat\u201d or any similar phrase(s) to describe our plant-based protein products as false or misleading or likely to create an erroneous impression regarding their composition.\nFor example, in 2018, the state of Missouri passed a law prohibiting any person engaged in advertising, offering for sale, or sale of food products from misrepresenting a product as meat that is not derived from harvested production livestock or poultry. The state of Missouri Department of Agriculture has clarified its interpretation that products which include prominent disclosure that the product is \u201cmade from plants,\u201d or comparable disclosure such as through the use of the phrase \u201cplant-based,\u201d are not misrepresented under the Missouri law. Additional states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming, have subsequently passed similar laws, and legislation that would impose specific requirements on the naming of plant-based meat products is currently pending in a number of other states. The United States Congress recently considered (but did not pass) federal legislation, called the Real MEAT Act, that could require changes to our product labeling and marketing, including identifying products as \u201cimitation\u201d meat products, and that would give USDA certain oversight over the labeling of plant-based meat products. If similar bills gain traction and ultimately become law, we could be required to identify our products as \u201cimitation\u201d in our product labels. Further, while we do not believe that USDA has the statutory authority to regulate plant-based products under the current legislative framework, USDA is considering naming requirements for other types of alternative protein products that could impact our naming expectations. Canadian Food and Drug Regulations also provide requirements for \u201csimulated meat\u201d products, including requirements around composition and naming.\nIn Europe, the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament proposed in May 2019 to reserve the use of \u201cmeat\u201d and meat-related terms and names for products that are manufactured from the edible parts of animals. In October 2020, the European Parliament rejected the adoption of this provision. In the absence of\nEuropean Union legislation, Member States remain free to establish national restrictions on meat-related names. In June 2020, France adopted a prohibition on using names to indicate foodstuffs of animal origin to describe, market, or promote foodstuffs containing vegetable proteins. In October 2021, France published a draft implementing decree that may enter into force by April 2022, to define, for example, the sanctions in case of non-compliance. There is a risk that this new law will require labeling of products of non-French origin. We do not believe that the new French bill complies with the laws of the European Union, in particular the principle of free movement of goods. In November 2021, Beyond Meat co-signed a letter from the European Alliance of Plant-Based Foods protesting this law. Should EU member state regulatory authorities take action with respect to the use of the term \u201cmeat\u201d or similar claims, such that we are unable to use those terms with respect to our plant-based products, we could be subject to enforcement action or recall of our products marketed with these terms, we may be required to modify our marketing strategy, or required to identify our products as \u201cimitation\u201d in our product labels, and our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. In October 2021, the Turkish authorities challenged the use of the Caped Longhorn superhero logo, as well as the name \u201cBeyond Meat,\u201d alleging that the consumer is misled as to the characteristics of our products. The local distributor has made a submission that this is an unlawful restriction under the EU-Turkey Free Trade Agreement. In December 2021, the Turkish authorities rejected this submission, and held that references to \u201cplant-based\u201d in combination with \u201cmeat\u201d would mislead the consumer. Separately, competitors may also try to bring legal action against us. In late September 2020, three meat trade associations announced that they had initiated a lawsuit against a French plant-based meat company for unfair competition and violating the prohibition on meaty names of June 2020. To the best of our knowledge, the lawsuit has not been filed yet. In October 2020, a French trade association representing the cattle industry sent a cease-and-desist letter to one of our contract manufacturers alleging that the use of \u201cmeat\u201d and meat-related terms is misleading the French consumer. As of January 31, 2022, we continued to be actively engaged in negotiations to settle this dispute. Nonetheless, despite our best efforts, these disputes could result in litigation before the courts, which could be costly and disruptive to our ability to market in these countries.\nIncreases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nIncreases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our financial performance. The increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation or business.\nFrom time to time, we may be party to various claims and litigation proceedings. We evaluate these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates.\nDon Lee Farms\nOn May 25, 2017, Don Lee Farms, a division of Goodman Food Products, Inc., filed a complaint against us in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles asserting claims for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition under the California Business and Professions\nCode, money owed and due, declaratory relief and injunctive relief, each arising out of our decision to terminate an exclusive supply agreement between us and Don Lee Farms. We denied all of these claims and filed counterclaims on July 27, 2017, alleging breach of contract, unfair competition under the California Business and Professions Code and conversion. In October 2018, the former co-manufacturer filed an amended complaint that added one of our then current contract manufacturers as a defendant, principally for claims arising from the then current contract manufacturer\u2019s alleged use of the former co-manufacturer\u2019s alleged trade secrets, and for replacing the former co-manufacturer as one of our co-manufacturers. The then current contract manufacturer filed an answer denying all of Don Lee Farms\u2019 claims and a cross-complaint against us asserting claims of total and partial equitable indemnity, contribution, and repayment. On March 11, 2019, Don Lee Farms filed a second amended complaint to add claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation against us. On May 30, 2019, the judge denied our motion to dismiss the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims, allowing the claims to proceed. On June 19, 2019, we filed an answer denying Don Lee Farms' claims.\nOn January 24, 2020, a writ judge granted Don Lee Farms a right to attach in the amount of $628,689 on the grounds that Don Lee Farms had established a \u201cprobable validity\u201d of its claim that Beyond Meat owes Don Lee Farms money for a small batch of unpaid invoices. This determination was not made by the trial judge.\nOn January 27, 2020, Don Lee Farms filed a third amended complaint to add three individual defendants, all of whom are our current or former employees, including Mark Nelson, the Company\u2019s former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, to Don Lee Farms\u2019 existing fraud claims alleging that those individuals were involved in the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations. On June 23, 2020, the judge denied Beyond Meat and the individual defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims, allowing the claims to proceed. On July 6, 2020, we and the individual defendants filed an answer denying all of Don Lee Farms\u2019 claims, including denying all allegations of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.\nOn August 11, 2020, we filed an amended cross-complaint against Don Lee Farms, its parent Goodman Food Products, Inc. and its owners and employees, Donald, Daniel, and Brandon Goodman. Among other claims, the amended cross-complaint alleges that Don Lee Farms defrauded Beyond Meat, misappropriated its trade secrets, and infringed its trademarks.\nOn January 28, 2021, Don Lee Farms filed a motion for summary adjudication on its breach of contract and money owed claims and on Beyond Meat\u2019s breach of contract claims. On February 18, 2021, Don Lee Farms and Donald, Daniel and Brandon Goodman filed a motion for summary adjudication on Beyond Meat\u2019s fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and conversion claims.\nOn February 16, 2021, the Court entered an order consolidating this action with an action that Don Lee Farms filed against CLW Foods, LLC, a current Beyond Meat contract manufacturer. On February 22, 2021, CLW Foods, LLC requested a continuance of the trial date, which the Court granted.\nOn March 19, 2021, Don Lee Farms requested the dismissal, without prejudice, of Don Lee Farms\u2019 claims against our former contract manufacturer, ProPortion Foods, LLC and current contract manufacturer CLW Foods, LLC. On, March 23, 2021, ProPortion Foods, LLC requested that its claims against us be dismissed without prejudice. On March 26, 2021, the Court granted Don Lee Farms\u2019 request to dismiss its claims against ProPortion Foods, LLC and CLW Foods, LLC; and granted ProPortion Foods, LLC request to dismiss its claims against us.\nOn May 7, 2021, the Court ruled on Don Lee Farms\u2019 motions for summary adjudication. The Court granted Don Lee Farms\u2019 motion for summary adjudication on its breach of contract and money owed claims, and Beyond Meat\u2019s negligent misrepresentation and conversion claims. The Court denied Don Lee Farms\u2019 motion for summary adjudication on Beyond Meat\u2019s breach of contract and fraud claims, allowing Beyond Meat\u2019s claims to proceed to trial.\nOn June 11, 2021, former Beyond Meat employees Mark Nelson and Tony Miller, and current employee, Jessica Quetsch (collectively, the \u201cindividual defendants\u201d), filed a motion for summary judgment on Don Lee Farms\u2019 fraud claim asserted against them. On June 11, 2021, we filed a motion for summary adjudication on\nDon Lee Farms\u2019 fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims, misappropriation of trade secret claim, and unfair competition claim under the California Business and Professions Code. On August 27, 2021, the Court ruled on the individual defendants\u2019 and our motions for summary adjudication. The Court denied the individual defendants\u2019 motion for summary adjudication. The Court also denied our motion for summary adjudication on Don Lee Farms\u2019 fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims. The Court granted our motion for summary adjudication on Don Lee Farms\u2019 trade secret misappropriation and unfair competition claims. Don Lee Farms\u2019 trade secret misappropriation and unfair competition claims will not proceed to trial.\nOn January 27, 2022, Don Lee Farms filed a motion for summary adjudication on Beyond Meat\u2019s trade secret misappropriation claim. The Court has not ruled on this motion. The hearing for this motion is scheduled for April 13, 2022.\nThe previous trial date, September 27, 2021, was continued. Trial is currently set for May 16, 2022.\nDon Lee Farms is seeking from Beyond Meat and the individual defendants unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We are seeking from Don Lee Farms monetary damages, restitution of monies paid to Don Lee Farms, injunctive relief, including the prohibition of Don Lee Farms\u2019 use or disclosure of Beyond Meat\u2019s trade secrets and the prohibition of Don Lee Farms\u2019 infringing use of Beyond Meat\u2019s trademarks, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\nWe believe we were justified in terminating the supply agreement with Don Lee Farms, that we are not liable for the fraud or negligent misrepresentation alleged in the third amended complaint, and that Don Lee Farms is liable for the conduct alleged in our amended cross-complaint. Conversely, as alleged in our amended cross-complaint, we believe Don Lee Farms misappropriated our trade secrets, defrauded us, and ultimately has infringed our trademarks.\nWe are currently in the process of litigating this matter and intend to vigorously defend ourselves and our current and former employees against the claims and to prosecute our own claims. We cannot assure you that Don Lee Farms will not prevail in all or some of their claims against us or the individual defendants, or that we will prevail in some or all of our claims against Don Lee Farms. For example, if Don Lee Farms succeeds in the lawsuit, we could be required to pay damages, including but not limited to contract damages reasonably calculated at what we would have paid Don Lee Farms to produce our products through 2019, the end of the contract term. Based on our current knowledge, we have determined that the amount of any material loss or range of any losses that is reasonably possible to result from this lawsuit is not estimable.\nSecurities Related Litigation\nOn January 30, 2020, Larry Tran, a purported shareholder of Beyond Meat, filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against Beyond Meat and two of our executive officers, our President and CEO, Ethan Brown, and our former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Mark Nelson. As noted herein and in previous filings, the Tran securities class action was dismissed with prejudice on October 27, 2020, except for the class allegations of absent putative class members, which were dismissed without prejudice.\nOn March 16, 2020, Eric Weiner, a purported shareholder of Beyond Meat, filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, putatively on behalf of the Company, against two of our executive officers, our President and CEO, Ethan Brown, and our former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Mark Nelson, and each of the Company\u2019s directors, including one former director, who signed our initial public offering registration statement. The lawsuit asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act, claims of breaches of fiduciary duty as directors and/or officers of Beyond Meat, and claims of unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets, all relating to our ongoing litigation with Don Lee Farms, related actions taken by Beyond Meat and the named individuals during the period of May 2, 2019 to March 16, 2020, and the Tran securities case brought against us.\nOn March 18, 2020, Kimberly Brink and Melvyn Klein, purported shareholders of Beyond Meat, filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, putatively on behalf of the Company, against two of the Company\u2019s executive officers, our President and CEO, Ethan Brown, and our former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Mark Nelson, and each of our directors, including one former director, who signed our initial public offering registration statement. The lawsuit asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act, claims of breaches of fiduciary duty as directors and/or officers of Beyond Meat, and claims of unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets, all relating to our ongoing litigation with Don Lee Farms, related actions taken by Beyond Meat and the named individuals during the period of May 2, 2019 to March 18, 2020, and the Tran securities case brought against Beyond Meat.\nOn May 27, 2020, Kevin Chew, a purported shareholder of Beyond Meat, filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court of the District of Delaware, putatively on behalf of Beyond Meat, against two of our executive officers, our President and CEO, Ethan Brown, and our former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Mark Nelson, and each of our directors, including one former director, who signed our initial public offering registration statement. The lawsuit asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Exchange Act and claims of breaches of fiduciary duty, relating to our ongoing litigation with Don Lee Farms, related actions taken by Beyond Meat and the named individuals during the period of May 2, 2019 to May 27, 2020. On June 16, 2020, the Court entered an order staying all proceedings in the derivative action until (1) the Tran securities class action is dismissed, with prejudice, and all appeals related thereto have been exhausted; or (2) any motion to dismiss the Tran securities class action is denied in whole or in part. On June 17, 2020, the Court entered an order administratively closing the derivative case based on the stay order. On July 29, 2021, the Court entered a Joint Stipulation to Continue the Stay of the Action, staying the case until the resolution of the California Derivative Action.\nOn April 1, 2020, the United States District Court for the Central District of California entered an order consolidating the Weiner action and the Brink/Klein action for all purposes and designated the consolidated case In re: Beyond Meat, Inc. Derivative Litigation (the \u201cCalifornia Derivative Action\u201d). On April 13, 2020, the Court entered an order appointing co-lead counsel for the California Derivative Action. On June 23, 2020, the Court entered an order approving a Joint Stipulation Regarding Stay of Actions. Under the terms of the stay approval order, all proceedings in the California Derivative Action are stayed until (1) the Tran securities class action is dismissed, with prejudice, and all appeals related thereto have been exhausted; or (2) any motion to dismiss the Tran securities class action is denied in whole or in part. As noted herein and in previous filings, the Tran securities class action was dismissed with prejudice on October 27, 2020, except for the class allegations of absent putative class members, which were dismissed without prejudice. On April 20, 2021, the parties filed a joint stipulation regarding briefing schedule, and the Court entered a schedule on April 21, 2021.\nOn May 24, 2021, the plaintiffs in the California Derivative Action filed a First Amended Complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d). The FAC names the same defendants named in the originally-filed consolidated complaint and adds four additional defendants, including ProPortion Foods, LLC (\u201cProPortion\u201d) and CLW Foods, LLC (\u201cCLW\u201d). The FAC asserts claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, claims of breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control and gross mismanagement against the individual defendants, and aiding and abetting claims against CLW and ProPortion. All of these claims relate to our dealings with and ongoing litigation with Don Lee Farms, and related actions taken by us and the named individuals during the period of April 2016 to the present. On July 2, 2021, the Court entered a Joint Stipulation Regarding Extension of Briefing Schedule so that the parties could attempt to reach resolution of the lawsuit.\nThe parties have reached a settlement of the California and Chew Derivative Actions. The proposed settlement, which is subject to Court approval, includes the Company enacting certain corporate governance reforms and paying plaintiffs\u2019 attorney fees and costs in the amount of $515,000, which amount has been accrued as of December 31, 2021. No other payment is contemplated in the proposed settlement. On October 1, 2021, the parties filed a Joint Report Regarding Settlement in the Central District of California stating that the parties reached a tentative settlement and requesting that the Court (i) vacate the briefing schedule for Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and (ii) issue an order setting November 19, 2021 as the deadline on or before which Plaintiffs must move for preliminary approval of the settlement. On October 4, 2021, the Court entered\nsuch an order. The parties requested and received another extension-to January 14, 2022-for Plaintiffs to file a motion for preliminary approval. The Stipulation of Settlement was signed on January 14, 2022, and Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval that same day. On February 8, 2022, the Court entered a Scheduling Notice and Order finding that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary approval is appropriate for submission on the papers without oral argument. The parties are waiting for the Court to rule on this motion.\nOn June 17, 2020, James Janolek, a purported shareholder of Beyond Meat, filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court of the District of Delaware, putatively on behalf of the Company, against two of our executive officers, our President and CEO, Ethan Brown, and our former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Mark Nelson, and each of our directors, including one former director, who signed our initial public offering registration statement. The lawsuit asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, claims of breaches of fiduciary duty as directors and/or officers of Beyond Meat, and claims of unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets, all relating to our ongoing litigation with Don Lee Farms, related actions taken by Beyond Meat and the named individuals during the period of May 2, 2019 to June 17, 2020. On July 10, 2020, the Court entered an order staying all proceedings in the derivative action until (1) the Tran securities class action is dismissed, with prejudice, and all appeals related thereto have been exhausted; or (2) any motion to dismiss the Tran securities class action is denied in whole or in part. On July 10, 2020, the Court entered an order administratively closing the derivative case based on the stay order. On November 9, 2020, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal without prejudice and without costs or attorney fees to either party.\nEven when not merited, the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management\u2019s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these legal disputes may result in adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nFurthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to self-insured retentions, various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our recovery.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur share price has been and may continue to be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, including:\n\u2022the effects of COVID-19; general economic, market and political conditions, including negative effects on consumer confidence and spending levels;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, including fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results;\n\u2022announcements of innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcement by competitors or new market entrants of their entry into or exit from the plant-based protein market;\n\u2022overall conditions in our industry and the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022market conditions or trends in the packaged food sales industry or in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022addition or loss of significant customers or other developments with respect to significant customers;\n\u2022adverse developments concerning our manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products or business;\n\u2022our ability to effectively manage our growth and market expectations with respect to our growth;\n\u2022speculation regarding public customer announcements or geographic expansion;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022issuance of new or updated research or reports about us or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022our failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public;\n\u2022fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products;\n\u2022litigation or regulatory matters;\n\u2022announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022our cash position;\n\u2022our indebtedness and ability to pay such indebtedness, as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreement;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by our stockholders;\n\u2022issuance of equity or debt;\n\u2022share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock;\n\u2022changes in accounting practices;\n\u2022ineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n\u2022short-selling of our common stock;\n\u2022negative media or marketing campaigns undertaken by our competitors or lobbyists supporting the meat industry;\n\u2022the public\u2019s response to publicity relating to the health aspects or nutritional value of our products; and\n\u2022other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, tariffs, international currency fluctuations, or the effects of disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For example, we are currently subject to multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits related, in part, to a securities case filed against us alleging federal securities law violations with respect to past disclosure, which case has since been dismissed with prejudice. Securities litigation, and any other type of litigation, brought against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Moreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We also have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans following the IPO or that are issuable upon exercise of outstanding options following the IPO. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. If any of these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or publish unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, our share price could decline.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, investors should rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could discourage a takeover attempt or delay changes in control;\n\u2022prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022providing that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022prohibiting the adoption, amendment or repeal of our amended and restated bylaws or the repeal of the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors without the required approval of at least 66.67% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, or the DGCL, govern us. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of our board of directors.\nThese and other provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine;\nprovided, that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. Our restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.\nOur ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had accumulated federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $514.1 million, $201.7 million and $24.6 million, respectively. Approximately $422.4 million of the federal net operating losses do not expire and the remaining federal, state and foreign tax loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031, 2032 and 2025, respectively, unless previously utilized. Utilization of the Company\u2019s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Code and similar state provisions.\nThe limitations apply if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period. We have experienced several ownership changes none of which is expected to result in a material limitation on the future use of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards generated prior to these ownership changes. However, any future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, Section 382 and 383 limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us. We are currently analyzing whether and to what extent we have experienced an ownership change pursuant to Section 382; and to the extent such change occurred, the impact to the availability of our tax attributes.", "PERMNO": 18572, "SIC": 2030, "TIC": "BYND"}
