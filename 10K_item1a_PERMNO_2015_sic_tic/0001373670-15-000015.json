{"cik": "1373670", "company": "Green Brick Partners, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. Any of these risks could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information contained under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to future fluctuations in response to a number of factors beyond our control. In recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company or its performance, and those fluctuations could materially reduce our common stock price.\nCertain large stockholders own a significant percentage of our shares and exert significant influence over us. Their interests may not coincide with yours and they may make decisions with which you may disagree.\nGreenlight Capital, Inc., and its affiliates (\u201cGreenlight\u201d), Third Point LLC and its affiliates (\u201cThird Point\u201d), and James R. Brickman, together with certain members of Mr. Brickman\u2019s family, beneficially own approximately 49.9%, 17.1% and 8.4%, respectively, of the voting power of the Company. These large stockholders, acting together, could determine substantially all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a sale or other change of control transaction. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of our company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, these stockholders could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that you would not approve or make decisions with which you may disagree.\nGreenlight, our largest stockholder, is also our largest creditor. Greenlight exerts a significant influence over us and its interest as a creditor may not coincide with our interest as a company or your interest as a stockholder.\nGreenlight controls approximately 49.9% of our outstanding common stock and we have incurred $150 million of indebtedness from Greenlight under our term loan facility. As our largest creditor, Greenlight may have interests that may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the interests of our stockholders generally. As our largest stockholder, Greenlight will exert a significant influence over us, which may cause us to enter into transactions or agreements, or to otherwise take actions, that you would not approve or make decisions with which you may disagree.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have not paid any dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nCertain large stockholders\u2019 shares may be sold into the market in the future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly.\nWe believe that all or a significant portion of our common stock beneficially owned by Greenlight, Third Point and Mr. Brickman are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws because they were acquired from us on a private, non-registered basis. We have entered into registration rights agreements with each of these parties, however, that give these parties the right to require us to register the resale of their shares under certain circumstances. If these holders sell substantial amounts of these shares, the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nRisk Related to Our Tax Asset, Indebtedness and Organizational Structure\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we reported federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $178.8 million, which will begin to expire, if not used, beginning with the year ending December 31, 2029.\nFor accounting purposes, a valuation allowance is required to reduce our potential deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of such assets will not be realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income. Based on the availability of historical financial results, projections of pre-tax book income and the assessment of available positive and negative information, management believes, on a more-likely-than-not basis, that the deferred tax assets will be realized in full. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recorded at December 31, 2014 with respect to the federal NOL.\nOur ability to utilize our tax attributes, such as NOL carryforwards and tax credits (\u201cTax Attributes\u201d), will be subject to significant limitation for federal income tax purposes if we undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). For this purpose, an ownership change generally occurs, as of any \u201ctesting date\u201d (as defined under Section 382 of the Code), if our \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d have collectively increased their ownership in our common stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the relevant testing period, which generally begins the later of either January 1, 2008 or three years preceding the relevant testing date. In general, our 5-percent shareholders would include any (i) individual who owns 5% or more (directly, indirectly or constructively) of our common stock and (ii) \u201cpublic groups\u201d who own our common stock (even in certain cases if they own less than 5% of our common stock) or stock in higher tier entities who own 5% or more (directly, indirectly or constructively) of our common stock. A \u201cpublic group\u201d generally consists of a group of persons each of whom owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) less than 5% of our common stock. An ownership change may therefore occur following substantial changes in the direct or indirect ownership of our outstanding stock by one or more 5-percent shareholders over this period.\nIf we were to experience an ownership change, Section 382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of our post-change taxable income that may be offset by our pre-change Tax Attributes. The limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Code for any post-change year is generally determined by multiplying the value of our common stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Any unused annual limitation may, subject to certain limits, be carried over to later years.\nTo reduce the likelihood of an ownership change, our board of directors has implemented the Section 382 rights agreement, and we have amended our Charter to add customary transfer and ownership limitations regarding preservation of our NOLs.\nOur ability to utilize our Tax Attributes to reduce taxable income in future years may be limited for various reasons, including if our projected future taxable income is insufficient to recognize the full benefit of such Tax Attributes prior to their expiration and/or if the IRS successfully asserts that a transaction or transactions were concluded with the principal purpose of securing future tax benefits. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income or that the IRS will not successfully challenge the use of our Tax Attributes in later years to enable us to utilize the Tax Attributes in full before they expire.\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.\nThe total principal amount of our debt as December 31, 2014 is $150.0 million (not including debt of certain of our subsidiaries relating to property acquisitions and development). Our substantial debt could have important consequences for the holders of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt or to our trade or other creditors;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and the proceeds of any capital markets offerings for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us through capital markets financings or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before its maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations or to repay existing indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional debt or equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, property acquisitions or developments, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements. If an event of default occurs under our term loan facility, the lenders may accelerate our repayment obligations and/or exercise other remedies under the facility.\nProvisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party or may reduce the value of your investment.\nSome provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (\u201cCharter\u201d) and bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder may deem to be in his or her best interest. For example, our board of directors may determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders. In addition, stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate directors or to propose business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders and may not take action by written consent. Additionally, both our 382 rights plan and our Charter contains transfer restrictions intended to prevent future acquisitions of our common stock that would limit our ability to use the NOLs. The existence of these provisions could also limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nThe homebuilding industry is cyclical. A severe downturn in the industry, such as the one experienced in 2006 through 2011, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stockholder\u2019s equity.\nThe residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions such as levels of employment, consumer confidence and income, availability of financing for acquisitions, construction and permanent mortgages, interest rate levels, inflation and demand for housing. Since early 2006, the U.S. housing market has been negatively impacted by declining consumer confidence, restrictive mortgage standards and large supplies of foreclosures, resales and new homes, among other factors. When combined with a prolonged economic downturn, high unemployment levels, increases in the rate of inflation and uncertainty in the U.S. economy, these conditions have contributed to decreased demand for housing, declining sales prices and increasing pricing pressure. While national data indicate that the overall demand for new homes improved during 2012, 2013, and 2014, in the event that the current recovery stalls or reverses and these economic and business trends continue or decline further, we could experience declines in the market value of our inventory and demand for our lots, homes and construction loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.\nReal estate investments are subject to various risks and fluctuations and cycles in value and demand, many of which are beyond our control. Certain events may decrease cash available for operations, as well as the value of our real estate assets. These events include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in international, national or local economic and demographic conditions;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in financial conditions of buyers and sellers of properties, particularly residential homes and land suitable for development of residential homes;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other real estate investors with significant capital, including other real estate operating companies and developers and institutional investment funds;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates, which could adversely affect the ability of homebuyers to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nunanticipated increases in expenses, including, without limitation, insurance costs, development costs, real estate assessments and other taxes and costs of compliance with laws, regulations and governmental policies; and\n\u2022\nchanges in enforcement of laws, regulations and governmental policies, including, without limitation, health, safety, environmental, zoning and tax laws.\nIn addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in a general decline in the purchase of homes or an increased incidence of home order cancellations. If we cannot successfully implement our business strategy, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nFurther, acts of war, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States and any foreign power or acts of terrorism may cause disruption to the U.S. economy, or the local economies of the markets in which we operate, cause shortages of building materials, increase costs associated with obtaining building materials, result in building code changes that could increase costs of construction, affect job growth and consumer confidence or cause economic changes that we cannot anticipate, all of which could reduce demand for our lots, homes and construction loans and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation or deflation.\nInflation can adversely affect our homebuilding operations by increasing costs of land, financing, materials, labor and construction. While we attempt to pass on cost increases to customers through increased prices, in a weak housing market, we may not be able to offset cost increases with higher selling prices. In addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on housing demand. In a highly inflationary environment, depending on industry and other economic conditions, we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. Moreover, with inflation, the costs of capital increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources could decline. Current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nAlternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance, which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes and have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the continued availability and satisfactory performance of subcontractors which, if unavailable, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and our homebuilding subsidiaries conduct our land development and construction operations only as a general contractor. Virtually all land development and construction work is performed by unaffiliated third-party subcontractors. As a consequence, the timing and quality of the development of our land and the construction of our homes depends on the availability and skill of our subcontractors. There may not be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third-party subcontractors in the markets in which we operate. In addition, inadequate subcontractor resources could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have recently experienced labor shortages and increased labor costs in both the DFW and Atlanta markets. These labor shortages have resulted in higher wages for subcontractors, construction workers frequently moving between jobs for higher pay, increased prices and delays in projects.\nLabor and raw material shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of land development and home construction, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe residential construction industry experiences labor and raw material shortages from time to time, including shortages in qualified tradespeople and supplies of insulation, drywall, cement, steel and lumber. These labor and raw material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing if either of the regions in which we operate experiences a natural disaster that has a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures. The cost of labor and raw materials may also be adversely affected during periods of shortage or high inflation. During the recent economic downturn, a large number of qualified tradespeople went out of business or otherwise exited the market in the DFW and Atlanta regions. This reduction in available tradespeople exacerbated labor shortages as demand for new housing increased in these markets.\nShortages and price increases could cause delays in, and increase our costs of, land development and home construction, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to recruit, retain and develop highly skilled, competent employees may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nKey employees, including management team members at both the corporate and homebuilder subsidiary levels, are fundamental to our ability to obtain, generate and manage opportunities. If any of the management team members were to cease employment with us, our results of operations could suffer. Our ability to retain our management team or to attract suitable replacements should any members of its management team leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key management team members or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. In addition, we do not maintain key person insurance in respect of any member of our senior management team.\nIn addition, key employees working in the land development, homebuilding and construction industries are highly sought after. Experienced employees in the homebuilding, land acquisition and construction industries are fundamental to our ability to generate, obtain and manage opportunities. In particular, local knowledge and relationships are critical to our ability to source attractive land acquisition opportunities. Failure to attract and retain such personnel or to ensure that their experience and knowledge is not lost when they leave the business through retirement, redundancy or otherwise may adversely affect the standards of our service and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to acquire undeveloped land, partially-finished developed lots and finished lots suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices, in accordance with our land investment criteria.\nThe homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land and the risk inherent in purchasing and developing land increases as consumer demand for housing increases. The availability of finished and partially-finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our investment criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability in general, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers, inflation in land prices, zoning, allowable housing density, the ability to obtain building permits and other regulatory requirements. Should suitable land or lots become more difficult to locate or obtain, the number of lots we may be able to develop and sell could decrease, the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could increase, perhaps substantially, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs competition for suitable land increases, the cost of acquiring both finished and undeveloped lots and the cost of developing owned land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline, which could adversely impact our financial results. The availability of suitable land assets could also affect the success of our land acquisition strategy, which may impact our ability to increase the number of actively selling communities, to grow our revenues and margins and to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf we are unable to develop communities successfully or within expected timeframes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBefore a community generates any revenue, time and material expenditures are required to acquire and prepare land, entitle and finish lots, obtain development approvals, pay taxes and construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model homes and sales facilities. It can take several years from the time that we acquire control of a property to the time that we make our first home sale on the site. Delays in the development of communities expose us to the risk of changes in market conditions for homes. A decline in our ability to develop and market our communities successfully and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and on our ability to service our debt and to meet our working capital requirements.\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties for reasonable prices in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited and we may be forced to hold non-income producing properties for extended periods of time.\nReal estate investments are relatively difficult to sell quickly. As a result, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited and we may be forced to hold non-income producing assets for an extended period of time. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms that we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.\nWe depend on the success of our controlled homebuilding subsidiaries.\nWe participate in the homebuilding business through subsidiaries in which we own a 50% controlling interest, which we refer to as our \u201cbuilders.\u201d We have entered into arrangements with these builders in order to take advantage of the local knowledge and relationships of the builders, acquire attractive land positions and brand images, manage our risk profile and leverage our capital base. The viability of our participation in the homebuilding business depends on our ability to maintain good relationships with our builders. Our builders are focused on maximizing the value of their operations and working with a partner that can help them be successful. The effectiveness of our management, the value of our expertise and the rapport we maintain with our builders are important factors for new builders considering doing business with us and may affect our ability to attract customers, subcontractors, employees or others upon whom our business, financial condition and results of operations ultimately depend. Further, our relationships with our builders generate additional business opportunities that support our growth. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our builders, we may be unable to fully take advantage of existing agreements or expand our relationships with these builders. Additionally, our opportunities for developing new relationships with additional builders may be adversely impacted.\nWe sell lots to our builders for their homebuilding operations and provide them loans to finance home construction. If our builders fail to successfully execute their business strategies for any reason, they may be unable to purchase lots from us, repay outstanding construction finance loans made by us or borrow from us in the future, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are required to either repurchase or sell a substantial portion of the equity interest in our controlled homebuilding subsidiaries, our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe operating agreements governing two of our controlled homebuilding subsidiaries contain buy-sell provisions that may be triggered in certain circumstances. In the event that a buy-sell event occurs, our builder will have the right to initiate a buy-sell process, which may happen at an inconvenient time for us. In the event the buy-sell provisions are exercised at a time when we lack sufficient capital to purchase the remaining equity interest, we may elect to sell our equity interest in the entity. If we are forced to sell our equity interest, we will no longer benefit from the future operations of the applicable entity. If a buy-sell provision is exercised and we elect to purchase the interest in an entity that we do not already own, we may be obligated to expend significant capital in order to complete such acquisition, which may result in our being unable to pursue other investments or opportunities. If either of these events occurs, our revenue and net income could decline or we may not have sufficient capital necessary to implement our growth strategy.\nOur geographic concentration could materially and adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in our current markets should decline.\nOur business strategy is focused on the development of land, the issuance of construction finance loans and the design, construction and sale of single-family detached and attached homes in the DFW and Atlanta markets, as well as the eventual entry into other geographic markets. In DFW, we principally operate in the counties of Dallas, Collin and Denton. In Atlanta, we principally operates in the counties of Fulton, Gwinnett, Cobb, Forsyth and Dekalb. Because our operations are concentrated in these areas, a prolonged economic downturn in one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and a disproportionately greater impact on us than other homebuilders with more diversified operations. Further, slower rates of population growth or population declines in the DFW or Atlanta markets, especially as compared to the high population growth rates in prior years, could affect the demand for housing, causing home prices in these markets to fall and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur developments are subject to extensive government regulation, which could cause us to incur significant liabilities or restrict our business activities.\nOur developments are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or \u201cslow-growth\u201d or \u201cno-growth\u201d initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development and service fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these\nprojects or prevent their development. As a result, lot and home sales could decline and costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the market value of our land and homes drops significantly, our profits would decrease.\nThe market value of land, building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions, and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values. We acquire land for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets, and may in the future acquire land for expansion into new markets. If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory, we may not be able to generate profits consistent with those we have generated in the past and we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell lots and homes. When market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating, option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable, at which time we may elect to forego deposits and pre-acquisition costs and terminate such arrangements. In the face of adverse market conditions, we may have substantial inventory carrying costs, may have to write down our inventory to its fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and/or may have to sell land or homes at a loss. Any material write-downs of assets, or sales at a loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe terms and availability of mortgage financing can affect consumer demand for homes and the ability of consumers to complete the purchase of a home. Because most of our homebuyers, and the homebuyers of those entities to whom we sell lots, finance the purchase of their homes, unfavorable terms in, or the unavailability of, mortgage financing could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur business depends on the ability of our homebuyers, as well as the ability of those who buy homes from the homebuilding entities to which we sell lots (our \u201chomebuilding customers\u201d), to obtain financing for the purchase of their homes. Many of these homebuyers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us or our homebuilding customers. Since 2009, the U.S. residential mortgage market as a whole has experienced significant instability due to, among other things, defaults on subprime and other loans, resulting in the declining market value of such loans. In light of these developments, lenders, investors, regulators and other third parties questioned the adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for several loan programs made available to borrowers in recent years. This has led to tightened credit requirements and an increase in indemnity claims for mortgages. Deterioration in credit quality among subprime and other nonconforming loans has caused most lenders to eliminate subprime mortgages and most other loan products that do not conform to Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d), Federal Housing Administration (the \u201cFHA\u201d) or Veterans Administration (the \u201cVA\u201d) standards. Fewer loan products and tighter loan qualifications, in turn, make it more difficult for a borrower to finance the purchase of a new home or the purchase of an existing home from a potential \u201cmove-up\u201d buyer who wishes to purchase a home from us or our homebuilding customers. If potential buyers of our or our homebuilding customers\u2019 homes, or the buyers of those potential buyers\u2019 existing homes, cannot obtain suitable financing, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nInterest rate increases or changes in federal lending programs or other regulations could lower demand for our lots, homes and construction finance loans, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRising interest rates, decreased availability of mortgage financing or of certain mortgage programs, higher down payment requirements or increased monthly mortgage costs may lead to reduced demand for our homes, lots and construction loans. Increased interest rates can also hinder our ability to realize our backlog because certain of our home purchase contracts provide customers with a financing contingency. Financing contingencies allow customers to cancel their home purchase contracts in the event that they cannot arrange for adequate financing. As a result, rising interest rates can decrease our home sales and mortgage originations. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, as a result of the turbulence in the credit markets and mortgage finance industry, the federal government has taken on a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, and its insurance of mortgages originated by lenders through the FHA and the VA. The availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including consumer interest rates for such loans, could be adversely affected by a curtailment or cessation of the federal government\u2019s mortgage-related programs or policies. The FHA may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards, raise minimum down payment requirements, impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs and/or limit the number of mortgages it insures. Due to growing federal budget deficits, the U.S. Treasury may not be able to continue supporting the mortgage-related activities of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA and the VA at present levels, or it may revise significantly the federal government\u2019s participation in and support of the residential mortgage market. Further, in 2013 the Obama\nadministration proposed the wind-down of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a proposal supported by Julian Castro, the current Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Because the availability of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA- and VA-backed mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing and selling many of our homes, any limitations, restrictions or changes in the availability of such government-backed financing could reduce our home sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law. This legislation provides for a number of new requirements relating to residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices, many of which are to be developed further by implementing rules. These include, among others, minimum standards for mortgages and lender practices in making mortgages, limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements, retention of credit risk and remedies for borrowers in foreclosure proceedings. The effect of these provisions on lending institutions will depend on the rules that are ultimately enacted. These requirements, however, as and when implemented, are expected to reduce the availability of loans to borrowers and/or increase the costs to borrowers to obtain such loans. Any such reduction could result in a decline of our home sales, lot sales and construction finance loan portfolio which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAny increase in unemployment or underemployment may lead to an increase in the number of loan delinquencies and property repossessions, which would have an adverse impact on us.\nThe unemployment rate in the United States was 5.6% as of December 2014, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (\u201cBLS\u201d). In addition, the labor force participation rate reported by the BLS has been declining, from 66.2% in January 2008 to 62.7% in December 2014, potentially reflecting an increased number of \u201cdiscouraged workers\u201d who have left the labor force. People who are not employed, are underemployed, who have left the labor force or are concerned about the loss of their jobs are less likely to purchase new homes, may be forced to try to sell the homes they own and may face difficulties in making required mortgage payments. Therefore, any increase in unemployment or underemployment may lead to an increase in the number of loan delinquencies and property repossessions and have an adverse impact on us both by reducing demand for our homes, lots and construction loans and by increasing the supply of homes for sale.\nAny limitation on, or reduction or elimination of, tax benefits associated with owning a home would have an adverse effect on the demand for our homes, lots and construction loans, which could be material to our business.\nChanges in federal income tax laws may affect demand for new homes. Current tax laws generally permit significant expenses associated with owning a home, primarily mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, to be deducted for the purpose of calculating an individual\u2019s federal and, in many cases, state taxable income. Various proposals have been publicly discussed to limit mortgage interest deductions and to limit the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence. If such proposals were enacted without offsetting provisions, the after-tax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers and the potential customers of our homebuilding customers. Enactment of any such proposal may have an adverse effect on the homebuilding industry in general, as the loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions could decrease the demand for new homes.\nThe occurrence of severe weather or natural disasters could increase our operating expenses and reduce our revenues and cash flows.\nThe climates and geology of the states in which we operate, Georgia and Texas, present increased risks of severe weather and natural disasters. The occurrence of severe weather conditions or natural disasters can delay new home deliveries and lot development, reduce the availability of materials and/or negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas. For example, the winter of 2013 - 2014 brought severe weather conditions in the states in which we operate, including extreme rain in Atlanta and abnormally low temperatures and icy conditions in the DFW region, which hindered land development and delayed home construction.\nFurther, to the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, wildfires or other natural disasters or similar events occur, our homes under construction or our building lots could be damaged or destroyed, which may result in losses exceeding our insurance coverage. Any of these events could increase our operating expenses, impair our cash flows and reduce our revenues.\nHigh cancellation rates may negatively impact our business.\nOur backlog reflects the number and value of homes for which we have entered into non-contingent sales contracts with customers but not yet delivered. (While we may accept sales contracts on a contingent basis in limited circumstances, such contracts are not included in our backlog until the contingency is removed.) Although these sales contracts typically require a cash deposit and do not allow for the sale to be contingent on the sale of the customer\u2019s existing home, a customer may in\ncertain circumstances cancel the contract and receive a complete or partial refund of the deposit as a result of local laws or contract provisions. If home prices decline, the national or local homebuilding environment or general economy weakens, our neighboring competitors reduce their sales prices (or increase their sales incentives), interest rates increase or the availability of mortgage financing tightens, homebuyers may have an incentive to cancel their contracts with us, even where they might be entitled to no refund or only a partial refund. Significant cancellations could have a material adverse effect on our business as a result of lost sales revenue and the accumulation of unsold housing inventory.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against competitors in the homebuilding, land development and financial services industries.\nCompetition in the land development and homebuilding industries is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry. Land developers and homebuilders compete for, among other things, customers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels for development and resale or homebuilding (or make such acquisitions more expensive), hinder our market share expansion and lead to pricing pressures that adversely impact its margins and revenues. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products. Furthermore, a number of our primary competitors are significantly larger, have a longer operating history and may have greater resources or lower cost of capital than us. Accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate. Our homebuilding business also competes for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.\nOur construction financing business competes with other lenders, including national, regional and local banks and other financial institutions, some of which have greater access to capital or different lending criteria and may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers.\nOur future growth may include additional strategic investments, joint ventures, partnerships and/or acquisitions of companies that may not be as successful as we anticipate and could disrupt our ongoing businesses and adversely affect our operations.\nOur investments in our homebuilding subsidiaries have contributed to our historical growth and similar investments may be a component of our growth strategy in the future. We may make additional strategic investments, enter into new joint venture or partnership arrangements or acquire businesses, some of which may be significant. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, significant start-up costs, insufficient revenues to offset expenses associated with these new investments and inadequate return of capital on these investments, any of which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to successfully identify and manage future investments, joint ventures, partnerships or acquisitions could harm our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain suitable bonding for the development of our housing projects.\nWe are often required to provide bonds to governmental authorities and others to ensure the completion of our projects. As a result of market conditions, surety providers have been reluctant to issue new bonds and some providers are requesting credit enhancements (such as cash deposits or letters of credit) in order to maintain existing bonds or to issue new bonds. If we are unable to obtain required bonds for our future projects, or if we are required to provide credit enhancements with respect to our current or future bonds, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDifficulty in obtaining sufficient capital could result in an inability to acquire land for our developments or increased costs and delays in the completion of development projects.\nThe homebuilding industry is capital-intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land parcels and begin development. If internally generated funds are not sufficient, we may seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources, including additional bank financings and/or securities offerings. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for land acquisition and construction financing, may be greatly reduced nationally, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. The credit and capital markets have recently experienced significant volatility. If we are required to seek additional financing to fund our operations, continued volatility in these markets may restrict our flexibility to access such financing. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures, we may be unable to acquire land for our housing developments and/or to develop the housing. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital for planned development expenditures could also cause project delays and any such delay could\nresult in cost increases. Any one or more of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may increase our costs, limit the areas in which we can build homes and develop land and delay completion of our projects.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding or development site vary according to multiple factors, including the site\u2019s location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding and land development activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders\u2019 compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to comply strictly with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders and land developers in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber.\nUnder various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including for bodily injury, and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nBuilding sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the homebuilding and land development industries poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of projects we work on, health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities and our ability to attract employees, subcontractors and customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPoor relations with the residents of our communities, or with local real estate agents, could negatively impact our home sales, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.\nResidents of communities we develop rely on us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities. Efforts made by us to resolve these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation. In addition, we could be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes or to modify its community development plans, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nMost of our homebuying customers engage local real estate agents that are unaffiliated with us in connection with their search for a new home. If we do not maintain good relations with, and a good reputation among, these real estate agents, the agents may not encourage consumers to consider, or may actively discourage consumers from considering, our communities, which could adversely affect its results of operations.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities, as well as to maintain our business records, including information provided by our customers. Many of these resources are provided to us and/or maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify certain security and service level standards. Our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if these resources are compromised, degraded, damaged or fail, whether due to a virus or other harmful circumstance, intentional penetration or disruption of our information technology resources by a third party, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption or failure or error (including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions (including the failure to follow our\nsecurity protocols) or lost connectivity to networked resources. A significant and extended disruption in the functioning of these resources could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, sales and revenue.\nProduct liability claims and litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high, and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited. This coverage may be further restricted and become more costly. If the limits or coverages of our current and former insurance programs prove inadequate, or we are not able to obtain adequate, or reasonably priced, insurance against these types of claims in the future, or the amounts currently provided for future warranty or insurance claims are inadequate, we may experience losses that could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, so our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate.\nHistorically, the homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly results of operations and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes four to six months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders convert to home deliveries. Because of this seasonality, homes starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occurs during the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although we may also be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.\nAdditionally, weather-related problems may occur in the late winter and early spring, delaying starts or closings or increasing costs and reducing profitability. In addition, delays in opening new communities or new sections of existing communities could have an adverse impact on home sales and revenues. Expenses are not incurred and recognized evenly throughout the year. Because of these factors, our quarterly results of operations may be uneven and may be marked by lower revenues and earnings in some quarters than in others.\nUtility and resource shortages or rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe markets in which we operate may in the future be subject to utility and resource shortages, including significant changes to the availability of electricity and water. Shortages of natural resources in our markets, particularly of water, may make it more difficult for us to obtain regulatory approval of new developments. We have also experienced material fluctuations in utility and resource costs across our markets, and we may incur additional costs and may not be able to complete construction on a timely basis if such fluctuations arise. Our lumber inventory is particularly sensitive to these shortages. Furthermore, these shortages and rate fluctuations may adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate, which may reduce demand for our homes, lots and construction loans and negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by the failure of persons who act on our behalf to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines.\nAlthough we expect all of our employees, officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, there may be instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business engage in practices that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines. Should we learn of practices relating to homes we build, lots we develop or financing we provide that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we would move actively to stop the non-complying practices as soon as possible and would take disciplinary action with regard to employees who were aware of the practices and did not take steps to address them, including in some instances terminating their employment. However, regardless of the steps we take after we learns of practices that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we can in some instances be subject to fines or other governmental penalties, and our reputation can be injured, due to the practices\u2019 having taken place.\nWe may become subject to litigation, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn the future, we may become subject to litigation, including claims relating to our operations and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. We generally intend to vigorously defend ourselves. However, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Resolution of these types of matters may result in us having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments and\nsettlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby materially and adversely affecting us. Certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could materially and adversely impact us, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and materially and adversely impact our ability to attract directors and officers.\nWe may suffer uninsured losses or suffer material losses in excess of insurance limits.\nWe could suffer physical damage to property and liabilities resulting in losses that may not be fully recoverable by insurance. In addition, certain types of risks, such as personal injury claims, may be, or may become in the future, either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may not be currently or in the future covered by our insurance policies or otherwise be subject to significant deductibles or limits. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur or be subject to deductibles, we could sustain financial loss or lose capital invested in the affected property as well as anticipated future income from that property. In addition, we could be liable to repair damage or meet liabilities caused by risks that are uninsured or subject to deductibles. We may be liable for any debt or other financial obligations related to affected property. Material losses or liabilities in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business.\nPrior to the completion of the Acquisition, JBGL had operated as a privately-held company since it began operations in 2008. Following the consummation of the Acquisition, we are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements has been and will continue to be time-consuming and will result in increased costs and could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (as amended, the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). These requirements may place a strain on our system and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we will need to commit significant resources, hire additional staff and provide additional management oversight. Since the consummation of the Acquisition, we have been implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. Sustaining our growth also may require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join us and to maintain appropriate operation and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. During the financial statement audit procedures conducted in connection with the preparation of JBGL\u2019s consolidated financial statements in connection with the Acquisition, we and Grant Thornton, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, identified material weaknesses in JBGL\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Additionally, as a result of management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, management concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and that as a result our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures for a description of the identified material weaknesses and our remediation plans.\nWhile we have taken a number of actions and continue to devote significant time and attention to remedy the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we are still in the process of implementing our remediation plan and additional time and effort will be required to complete the implementation. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate these material weaknesses or that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to complete our remediation in a timely manner, to remediate material weaknesses or significant deficiencies noted by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm or to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in material misstatements in our financial statements, result in harm to\nour business and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. The foregoing may result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and a decline in the trading price of our common stock. Failure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules of the SEC could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or other regulatory authorities.", "PERMNO": 92089, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "GRBK"}
