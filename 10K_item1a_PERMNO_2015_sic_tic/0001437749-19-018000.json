{"cik": "763532", "company": "LSI INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-09-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or future results. Any one of these factors could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nLower levels of economic activity in our end markets could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur businesses operate in several market segments including, but not limited to, commercial, industrial, retail, petroleum / convenience store and automotive. Operating results can be negatively impacted by volatility in these markets. Future downturns in any of the markets we serve could adversely affect our overall sales and profitability. In addition, customer difficulties in the future could result from economic declines or issues arising from the cyclical nature of their business and, in turn, result in decreases in product demand, increases in bad debt write-offs, decreases in timely collection of accounts receivable and adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, resulting in material reductions to our revenues and net earnings.\nThe markets in which we operate are subject to competitive pressures that could affect selling prices, and therefore could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive, and we compete on the basis of price, quality, service and/or brand name across the industries and markets served. Some of our competitors for certain products, primarily in the Lighting Segment, have greater sales, assets and financial resources. Some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices in foreign currencies. Accordingly, currency fluctuations could cause our U.S. dollar-priced products to be less competitive than our competitors\u2019 products which are priced in other currencies. Competitive pressures could affect prices we charge our customers or demand for our products, which could adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, customers for our products may attempt to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce the size and diversity of their inventories and their transaction costs. To remain competitive, we will need to invest continuously in research and development, manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and we may be unable to maintain our competitive position.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic, political and market conditions.\nEconomic and political conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in our industry at large, as well as to the specific segments and markets in which we operate. When combined with ongoing customer consolidation activity and periodic manufacturing and inventory initiatives, an uncertain macro-economic and political climate, including but not limited to the effects of possible weakness in domestic and foreign financial and credit markets, could lead to reduced demand from our customers and increased price competition for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories and uncollectible receivables, and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue. If the markets in which we participate experience further economic downturns, as well as a slow recovery period, this could negatively impact our sales and revenue generation, margins and operating expenses, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrice increases or significant shortages of raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating margin.\nThe Company purchases large quantities of raw materials and components such as steel, aluminum, LEDs, electronic components, plastic lenses, glass lenses, vinyls, inks, and corrugated cartons. Materials comprise the largest component of costs, representing approximately 62% and 61% of the cost of sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively. While we have multiple sources of supply for most of our material requirements, significant shortages could disrupt the supply of raw materials. Further significant tariffs or increases in the price of these raw materials and components could further increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and materially adversely affect margins. Although the Company attempts to pass along increased costs in the form of price increases to customers, the Company may be unsuccessful in doing so for competitive reasons. Even when price increases are successful, the timing of such price increases may lag significantly behind the incurrence of higher costs. On occasion, there are selected electronic component parts and certain other parts shortages in the market place, some of which have affected the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations and shipment schedules even though multiple suppliers may be available. The lead times of these suppliers can increase and the prices of some of these parts have increased during periods of shortages.\nWe have a concentration of net sales to the petroleum / convenience store market, and any substantial change in this market could have an adverse effect on our business.\nApproximately 32% of our net sales in fiscal year 2019 are concentrated in the petroleum / convenience store market. Sales to this market segment are dependent upon the general conditions prevailing in and the profitability of the petroleum/convenience store industries and general market conditions. Our petroleum market business can be subject to reactions by the petroleum industry to world political events, particularly those in the Middle East, and to the price and supply of oil. Major disruptions in the petroleum industry generally result in a curtailment of retail marketing efforts, including expansion and refurbishing of retail outlets, by the petroleum industry and adversely affect our business. Any substantial change in purchasing decisions by one or more of our larger customers whether due to actions by our competitors, customer financial constraints, and industry factors or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company may pursue future growth through strategic acquisitions, alliances, or investments, which may not yield anticipated benefits\nThe Company has strengthened its business through strategic acquisitions, alliances, and investments and may continue to do so as opportunities arise in the future. Such investments have been and may be start-up or development stage entities. The Company will benefit from such activity only to the extent that it can effectively leverage and integrate the assets or capabilities of the acquired businesses and alliances including, but not limited to, personnel, technology, and operating processes. Moreover, unanticipated events, negative revisions to valuation assumptions and estimates, diversions of resources and management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and difficulties in attaining synergies, among other factors, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recover initial and subsequent investments, particularly those related to acquired goodwill and intangible assets or non-controlling interests. In addition, such investment transactions may limit the Company\u2019s ability to invest in other activities, which could be more profitable or advantageous.\nIf we do not develop the appropriate new products or if customers do not accept new products, we could experience a loss of competitive position which could adversely affect future revenues.\nThe Company is committed to product innovation on a timely basis to meet customer demands. Development of new products for targeted markets requires the Company to develop or otherwise leverage leading technologies in a cost-effective and timely manner. Failure to meet these changing demands could result in a loss of competitive position and seriously impact future revenues. Products or technologies developed by others may render the Company\u2019s products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. A fundamental shift in technologies in key product markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and competitive position within the industry. More specifically, the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends. Rapidly changing product technologies could adversely impact operating results due to potential technological obsolescence of certain inventories or increased warranty expense related to newly developed LED lighting products. We may experience design, manufacturing, marketing or other difficulties, such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of experienced engineers that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses. Such difficulties could cause us to lose business from our customers and could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, added expenses could decrease the profitability associated with those products that do not gain market acceptance.\nOur business is cyclical and seasonal, and in downward economic cycles our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nHistorically, sales of our products have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions. The demand for our products reflects the capital investment decisions of our customers, which depend upon the general economic conditions of the markets that our customers serve, including, particularly, the petroleum/convenience store industries. During periods of expansion in construction and industrial activity, we generally have benefited from increased demand for our products. Conversely, downward economic cycles in these industries result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products, which may reduce our profits and cash flow. During economic downturns, customers also tend to delay purchases of new products. The cyclical and seasonal nature of our business could at times adversely affect our liquidity and financial results.\nA loss of key personnel or inability to attract qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends on the ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and finance personnel, and, to a significant extent, upon the efforts and abilities of senior management. The Company\u2019s management philosophy of cost-control results in a lean workforce. Future success of the Company will depend on, among other factors, the ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel, particularly management, research and development engineers and technical sales professionals. The loss of the services of any key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe costs of litigation and compliance with environmental regulations, if significantly increased, could have an adverse effect on our operating profits.\nWe are, and may in the future be, a party to any number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving patent litigation, product liability, employment matters, and environmental matters, which could be significant. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and it could potentially be possible we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for clean up or other costs or damages under environmental laws.\nThe turnover of independent commissioned sales representatives could cause a significant disruption in sales volume.\nCommissioned sales representatives are critical to generating business in the Lighting Segment. From time to time, commissioned sales representatives representing a particular region resign or are terminated and replaced with new commissioned sales representatives. During this period of transition from the previous agency to the new one, sales in the particular region will likely fall as business is disrupted. It may take several months for the new sales representative to generate sales that will equal or exceed the previous sales representative. There is also the risk that the new sales agency will not attain the sales volume of the previous agency. These sales representative changes may occur individually as one agency is replaced due to lack of performance. On the other hand, these sales representative changes can be widespread as a result of the competitive nature of the lighting industry as LSI and its competition vie for the strongest sales agency in a particular region.\nThe Company may be unable to sustain significant customer and/or channel partner relationships.\nRelationships with customers are directly impacted by the Company\u2019s ability to deliver quality products and services. Although no individual customer exceeded 10% of sales during the current fiscal year, the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by certain large customers could harm the Company in a meaningful manner. The Company has relationships with channel partners such as electrical distributors, home improvement retailers, independent sales agencies, system integrators, and value-added resellers. While the Company maintains positive, and in many cases long-term relationships with these channel partners, the loss of a number of channel partners or substantial decrease in the volume of purchases from a major channel partner or group of channel partners could adversely affect the Company.\nChanges in a customer\u2019s demands and commitment to proprietary inventory could result in significant inventory write-offs.\nUpgrading or replacing a customer\u2019s current image requires the manufacture of inventory that is specific to the particular customer. This is particularly true in the Graphics Segment. In as many instances as possible, we require a commitment from the customer before the inventory is produced. Our request for a commitment can range from a single site or store to a large roll-out program involving many sites or stores. The risk does exist that a customer cannot or will not honor its commitment to us. The reasons a customer cannot or will not honor its commitment can range from the bankruptcy of the customer, to the change in the image during the roll-out program, to canceling the program before its completion and before the inventory is sold to the customer. In each of these instances, we could be left with significant amounts of inventory required to support the customer\u2019s re-imaging. While all efforts are made to hold the customer accountable for its commitment, there is the risk that a significant amount of inventory could be deemed obsolete or no longer usable which could result in significant inventory write-offs.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may lose some of our competitive advantage.\nOur success is determined in part by our ability to obtain United States and foreign patent protection for our technology and to preserve our trade secrets. Our ability to compete and the ability of our business to grow could suffer if our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in patents being issued or that current or additional patents will afford protection against competitors. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection and contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. Failure of our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technology and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to more effectively compete with us and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others. No guarantee can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology.\nSudden or unexpected changes in a customer\u2019s creditworthiness could result in significant accounts receivable write-offs.\nThe Company takes a conservative approach when extending credit to its customers. Customers are granted an appropriate credit limit based upon the due diligence performed on the customer which includes, among other things, the review of the company\u2019s financial statements and banking information, various credit checks, and payment history the customer has with the Company. At any given time, the Company can have a significant amount of credit exposure with its larger customers. While the Company is frequently monitoring its outstanding receivables with its customers, the likelihood does exist that a customer with large credit exposure is unable to make payment on its outstanding receivables which could result in a significant write-off of accounts receivable.\nFailure of the Company\u2019s operating or information system or a compromise of security with respect to its operating system or portable electronic devices could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition or the effectiveness of internal controls over operations and financial reporting.\nInformation technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security caused by such factors, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, fire, theft, fraud, malicious attack or other causes could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, negatively affecting the Company\u2019s online offerings and services, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information, or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. There can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nIf the Company\u2019s products are improperly designed, manufactured, packaged, or labeled, the Company may need to recall those items, may have increased warranty costs, and could be the target of product liability claims\nThe Company may need to recall products if they are improperly designed, manufactured, packaged, or labeled, and the Company does not maintain insurance for such recall events. Many of the Company's products and solutions have become more complex in recent years and include more sophisticated and sensitive electronic components. The Company has increasingly manufactured certain of those components and products in its own facilities. The Company has previously initiated product recalls as a result of potentially faulty components, assembly, installation, and packaging of its products. Widespread product recalls could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, penalties, and lost sales due to the unavailability of a product for a period of time. In addition, products developed by the Company that incorporate new technologies, such as LED technology, generally provide for more extensive warranty protection which may result in higher costs if warranty claims on these products are higher than historical amounts. The Company may also be liable if the use of any of its products causes harm, and could suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against the Company in excess of its insurance limits. The Company may not be able to obtain indemnity or reimbursement from its suppliers or other third parties for the warranty costs or liabilities associated with its products. A significant product recall, warranty claim, or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in its products.\nOur stock price has experienced a significant decline, which could further adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced a significant decline from which it has not fully recovered. During the last twelve months, the sales price of our common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, declined from a high of $8.69 in February 2018 to a low of $2.48 on March 28, 2019. Most recently, on August 30, 2019, the market price of our common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, closed at a price of $4.47 per share. Our progress in developing and commercializing our products, our quarterly operating results, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, our perceived prospects, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, including in fiscal 2019, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations, regardless of the cause, may materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.\nChanges in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under our credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR, depending on our selection of repayment options. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) in the UK announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Broad Treasury Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our credit facility and may not able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. The overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate our credit facility with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nAny actual or perceived failure by us to comply with legal or regulatory requirements related to privacy or data security in one or multiple jurisdictions could result in proceedings, actions or penalties against us.\nThere are numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations, decisions and directives regarding privacy and the collection, storage, transmission, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and other personal, customer or other data, the scope of which is continually evolving and subject to differing interpretations. For example, in the U.S., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) privacy and security rules require us as a business associate to protect the confidentiality of patient health information, and the Federal Trade Commission has begun to assert authority over protection of privacy and the use of cyber security in information systems. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018, imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data that will increase our obligations and, in the event of violations, may impose significant fines of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide annual revenue or \u20ac20 million. In the UK, a Data Protection Bill that substantially implements the GDPR became law in May 2018. China and Russia have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data. Further, in June 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which will become effective on January 1, 2020. CCPA imposes stringent data privacy and data protection requirements for the data of California residents, and provides for penalties for noncompliance of up to $7,500 per violation. The restrictions imposed by these laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products, reduce overall demand for our products, require us to modify our data handling practices and impose additional costs and burdens. In addition, U.S. and international laws that have been applied to protect user privacy (including laws regarding unfair and deceptive practices in the U.S. and GDPR in the EU) may be subject to evolving interpretations or applications in light of privacy developments. As a result, we may be subject to significant consequences, including penalties and fines, for any failure to comply with such laws, regulations and directives.\nData protection legislation around the world is comprehensive and complex and there has been a recent trend towards more stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection and confidentiality of personal data. The restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products and services, reduce overall demand for our products and services, require us to modify our data handling practices, and impose additional costs and burdens. With increasing enforcement of privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations, there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to enforcement actions by governmental bodies or that our costs of compliance will not increase significantly. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. In addition, there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies. While we have not been named in any such suits, if a substantial breach or loss of data from our records were to occur, we could become a target of such litigation. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines and public censure, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nU.S. Government trade actions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, and results of operation.\nThe United States and China have been engaged in protracted negotiations over the Chinese government\u2019s acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation that the Trump Administration has found to be unreasonable and burdensome to US commerce. To date, the President has used his authority under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 three times to levy a 25% retaliatory tariff on 6,830 subheading categories of imported Chinese high-tech and consumer goods valued at $250 billion per year. Although List 3, alone valued at $200 billion, had originally set an additional duty rate at 10%, that rate was increased to 25% effective May 10, 2019. Moreover, in August 2019, the President announced a 10% tariff on a fourth list of goods valued at nearly $300 billion to take effect September 1, 2019, which has subsequently been delayed until December 15, 2019. These tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or other trade actions that may be implemented, may increase the cost of certain materials and/or products that we import from China, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. These actions could require us to raise our prices, which could decrease demand for our products. As a result, these actions, including potential retaliatory measures by China and further escalation into a potential \u201ctrade war\u201d, may adversely impact our business. Given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of these trade actions by the United States or other countries, as well as the potential for additional trade actions, the impact on our operations and results remains uncertain.", "PERMNO": 89456, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "LYTS"}
