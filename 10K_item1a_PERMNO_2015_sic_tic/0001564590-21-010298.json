{"cik": "1016169", "company": "ANTARES PHARMA, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following \u201crisk factors\u201d contain important information about us and our business and should be read in their entirety. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we now believe to be not material could also impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all of your investment. In this Section, the terms the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d refer to Antares Pharma, Inc.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe have historically incurred significant losses, and there is no guarantee that we can sustain or grow our profitability.\nAlthough we generated $56.2 million of net income for the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred net losses of $2.0 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, we had an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2020 of $222.6 million. The costs for research and development of our products, product candidates and drug delivery technologies, along with marketing and selling expenses and general and administrative expenses, have been the principal causes of our losses. Although we have reported net earnings and earnings per share in recent quarters and for the most recent annual period, there is no guarantee we will continue to post profitable results of operations or maintain profitability on an annual or quarterly basis, and as a result your investment could be harmed.\nWe have significant outstanding indebtedness under a loan and security agreement. If we do not have sufficient cash available to repay the outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due, or if an event of default were to occur that provides Hercules Capital, Inc. the right to accelerate the outstanding balance of the loan and to take possession of some or all of our collateral securing the loan, either situation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have entered into a loan and security agreement, referred to herein as the Hercules Loan Agreement, with Hercules Capital, Inc., (\u201cHercules\u201d) for a term loan of up to $50.0 million, under which we have borrowed a total of $40.0 million. The loan is secured by substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets, excluding intellectual property, and will mature on July 1, 2022, unless extended to July 1, 2024 contingent upon satisfaction of a certain loan extension milestone. Under the Hercules Loan Agreement, an event of default will occur if, among other things, we fail to make payments as required under the Hercules Loan Agreement, we breach or default in the performance of any covenant or secured obligation under the Hercules Loan Agreement, a circumstance occurs that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company, we become unable to pay our debts as they come due or are otherwise insolvent, we or our assets become subject to certain legal proceedings such as bankruptcy proceedings or a cross default to other indebtedness obligations of the Company in excess of $500,000, or a stop order is issued with respect to our common stock. Upon the occurrence of an event of default and following any applicable cure periods, if any, Hercules may take certain actions as set forth in the Hercules Loan Agreement, including declaring all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable. If Hercules exercises this right, we may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay such indebtedness at the time any such event of default occurs. Hercules could also exercise its rights as collateral agent to take possession and dispose of the collateral securing the loan for its benefit, which collateral includes all of our property other than our intellectual property. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any of these events.\nThere is no guarantee that healthcare providers and patients will adopt our or our partners\u2019 products or continue to use or prescribe our or our partners\u2019 products, or that we and our partners will be able to receive and maintain adequate payer coverage and reimbursement.\nSuccessful sales of our products depend on the continued prescription by healthcare providers, adoption by patients, and the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. There is no guarantee that healthcare and patients\u2019 providers will adopt any newly approved products or continue to prescribe and use products, or that insurers and governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, will provide adequate coverage and reimbursement, or will not disadvantage our products through imposition of prior authorization, step therapy, high co-payments, or similar formulary management techniques. For instance, coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Additionally, certain third-party payers restrict or block access to patients for new products until a clinical review has occurred or clinical evidence is provided to support the benefits for covered patients. Many states also use formularies and preferred drug lists to obtain supplemental Medicaid rebates in excess of those required for Medicaid coverage. The industry competition to be included in such formularies and not disadvantaged often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Any labeled limitations on the use of a product or warnings could discourage adoption of the product by patients, healthcare providers, and insurers.\nTo ensure sales, manufacturers often must provide multiple discounts on the same drug in the chain of distribution to the healthcare provider and the payer. Further, manufacturers are required to assume responsibility for Medicare Part D prescription costs for innovator drugs and biologics and authorized generics while the beneficiary is in the coverage gap. Increasingly, payers are looking for metrics and performance-based pricing to justify increased costs of therapeutic advancements. Even if coverage is\nobtained, the net realization from price concessions may negatively impact our profitability. Government health programs also impose inflation penalties that may have adverse consequences if we increase prices in the future. Moreover, we and our partners may experience a delay in receiving coverage and reimbursement for any new products or may not receive adequate levels of coverage or reimbursement at all. By way of example, while we have obtained significant payer coverage for our testosterone replacement treatment product, XYOSTED\u00ae, there is no assurance that we will maintain coverage with payers or remain at the same coverage level with existing payers in future periods. New competitive products may be approved and payers may disadvantage our products in favor of the newly approved products and technologies. If the time to obtain coverage is lengthy, if we are unable to obtain or maintain adequate coverage, or if the rebates we negotiate are higher than anticipated, it may negatively impact our revenue from product sales.\nAdditionally, if healthcare providers and patients do not adopt any new product, or if insurers restrict patient access or disadvantage our or our partners\u2019 products in their formularies or otherwise do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement, we and our partners may not be able to generate sustainable revenue growth from product sales and royalties which will have a material adverse effect on our business and future product opportunities. We and our partners, accordingly, may need to take steps to assist patients in their ability to afford our products, such as offering bridge programs, free-trials, discounts, rebates and co-pay coupon programs. As an example, we currently offer co-pay assistance to eligible patients designed to help off-set the amount of a patient\u2019s co-pay insurance for XYOSTED\u00ae, OTREXUP\u00ae and NOCDURNA\u00ae. These programs, however, may not ultimately be successful.\nNew information concerning our or our partners\u2019 products learned through required post-approval studies and product use may also result in changes to our or our partners\u2019 products. Should any of these events occur, they could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and business.\nAny post-approval requirements, including phase IV studies may also require the dedication of substantial time and resources. By example, as a post-marketing requirement for XYOSTED\u00ae, we must conduct a pediatric study and the FDA has asked us to conduct a separate label comprehension study that assesses patients\u2019 understanding of key risk messages in the Medication Guide for XYOSTED\u00ae and a study of testosterone replacement therapy in pediatric males ages 14 years and older for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. The label comprehension study findings may result in revisions to the Medication Guide to optimize patients\u2019 understanding of important risks of XYOSTED\u00ae and potentially other label restrictions or changes. The FDA found that our first label comprehension study did not fulfill the post approval requirement and, thus, we are preparing to conduct a new label comprehension study, which must be completed by the end of 2026 and will require dedication of funds and resources. Additionally, the outcome of any post-approval studies, including the pediatric study, is uncertain and may not result in an expanded label indication or could result in additional labeling requirements or other post-approval restrictions or regulatory actions.\nAdditionally, use of our or our partners\u2019 products by patients and in phase IV and post-marketing studies may result in the discovery of new information concerning the products. This may result in regulatory or other actions, including, product liability actions, enforcement actions, distribution and manufacturing restrictions, changes to product labeling and promotional materials, the imposition of post-market requirements, such as REMS or additional phase IV studies, withdrawal of marketing application approvals, withdrawal of the product from the market, refusal to approve new marketing applications or supplements, product recalls, clinical holds and suspension of clinical studies, safety alerts, dear healthcare provider letters, adverse publicity, and reimbursement and insurance coverage consequences, among others. Should any of these events occur, they could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and business. By way of example, in October 2020 the FDA proposed that Makena\u00ae be withdrawn from the market following a review by the FDA\u2019s Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee. AMAG subsequently requested an FDA public hearing. While, at this time, Makena\u00ae may still be marketed, we do not yet know what the FDA\u2019s ultimate decision will be and whether AMAG will decrease the resources that it dedicates to Makena\u00ae. The uncertainty with regard to Makena\u00ae has negatively impacted our product revenue and royalties from AMAG and may adversely impact the business.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, manufacturers, principal investigators, or contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, manufacturers, investigators or CROs could include intentional, reckless, negligent, or unintentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws, provide accurate information to the FDA, properly calculate pricing information required by federal programs, comply with federal procurement rules or contract terms, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. This misconduct could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter this type of misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Moreover, it is possible for a whistleblower to pursue a False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) case against us based on the actions or inactions of these third parties even if the government considers the claim unmeritorious and declines to intervene, which could require us to incur costs\ndefending against such a claim. Further, due to the risk that a judgment in an FCA case could result in exclusion from federal health programs or debarment from government contracts, whistleblower cases often result in large settlements. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe rely on third parties to perform many necessary services for XYOSTED\u00ae, OTREXUP\u00ae and NOCDURNA\u00ae including services related to the distribution, invoicing, rebates and contract administration, co-pay program administration, sample distribution and administration, storage and transportation of our products.\nWe have retained third-party service providers, including Cardinal, to perform a variety of functions related to the distribution, invoicing, rebates and contract administration, co-pay program administration, sample distribution and administration, storage and transportation of our products, key aspects of which are out of our direct control. We place substantial reliance on this provider as well as other third-party providers that perform services for us, including entrusting our inventories of products to their care and handling. We also rely on third parties to administer our drug price reporting and rebate payments and contracting obligations under federal programs. Despite our reliance on third parties, we are responsible for compliance with the applicable legal and program requirements. By example, in certain states, we are required to hold licenses to distribute our products in the states and must comply with the associated state laws. Moreover, if these third-party service providers fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us or encounter physical damage or a natural disaster at their facilities, our ability to deliver products to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired. In addition, we use third parties to perform various other services for us relating to regulatory monitoring, including adverse event reporting, safety database management and other product maintenance services. If our employees or any third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we and/or they may face regulatory or FCA enforcement actions. Moreover, if the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient, our ability to continue to market our products could be jeopardized or we and/or they could be subject to regulatory sanctions. We do not currently have the internal capacity to perform these important commercial functions, and we may not be able to maintain commercial arrangements for these services on reasonable terms.\nWe are dependent on numerous third parties in our supply chain for the supply and manufacture of our products and our partners\u2019 products. If we do not develop and maintain relationships with suppliers, manufacturers, assemblers and/or licensees of our and our partners\u2019 drug/device products or product candidates, or if such third parties are unable to supply or manufacture products or assemble and package the final products, we may be unable to successfully manufacture, assemble, package and sell our and our partners\u2019 products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe availability of our products and product candidates depends upon our ability to procure the raw materials, components, packaging materials and finished products that we need from third parties. We have entered into supply agreements with numerous third-party suppliers, many of which are currently our single source for the materials necessary for certain of our products. If any of these or other third parties are unable to supply their respective components for any reason, including due to violations of the FDA\u2019s QSR or cGMP requirements, our or our partners\u2019 ability to manufacture the finished product will be adversely affected and our ability to meet the supply and demand for any sales of such products and the resulting revenue therefrom will be negatively affected. Additionally, as many of our components are manufactured by sole third-party suppliers, in the event of a failure to supply, we may not be able to find alternative third suppliers in a timely or cost-effective manner. Moreover, any failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements could subject us, our suppliers, or our collaborators to regulatory enforcement actions or recalls. In the case of product candidates, our and our partners\u2019 ability to conduct the necessary studies would also be adversely impacted.\nWe do not currently utilize our own facilities to manufacture commercial quantities of our or our partners\u2019 drug/device combination products or components, including but not limited to XYOSTED\u00ae, OTREXUP\u00ae, Sumatriptan Injection USP, epinephrine auto-injector devices, Makena\u00ae auto injectors or any other of our or our partners\u2019 products or product candidates. We also do not possess the facilities to manufacture clinical supplies of any product candidates or components. We must contract with third parties and/or our partners to produce products, components, and product candidates and to assemble and package finished products and related components according to specifications and that must comply with all applicable manufacturing requirements, including cGMPs for drug products and QSRs for medical devices. The future development and delivery of our and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates depend on the capability, as well as the timely, profitable and competitive performance of these third parties and/or our partners, in addition to their initial and continued FDA approval following regulatory authority facility inspections and compliance. There is also no assurance that such third parties and/or our partners will be willing to manufacture, assemble or sell the drug/device products or components or that they will not encounter manufacturing delays, problems, or difficulties. A limited number of manufacturers exist that are capable of manufacturing our and our partners\u2019 products, components, and product candidates. We and our partners may fail to contract with the necessary third parties or we and our partners may contract with third parties on terms that may not be favorable to us. By example, the cost of manufacturing may be impacted in the future by a number of different factors, including, but not limited to, changes in law, as well as global trade policies.\nIn addition, contract manufacturers may use their own technology, technology developed by us, technology developed by our partners, or technology acquired or licensed from third parties. When contract manufacturers develop proprietary process technology, our reliance on such contract manufacturers is increased. A technology transfer from the original contract manufacturer may be required. Any such technology transfer may also require the transfer of requisite data for regulatory purposes, including information\ncontained in a proprietary drug or device master file held by a contract manufacturer. We and/or our partners would be dependent on the contract manufacturer for the maintenance and right of reference to the drug or device master file. If the contract manufacturer fails to maintain a drug or device master file or withdraws our or our partners\u2019 right of reference, we and/or our partners may no longer be able to manufacture, develop, market, and sell our or our partners\u2019 products or product candidates.\nWe rely on multiple commercial supply arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, including, without limitation: the production and supply of the methotrexate, sumatriptan and testosterone drug substance in pre-filled syringes; the manufacture of prefilled syringes; the manufacture of device components; the manufacture and partial assembly of VIBEX\u00ae and Quickshot auto injectors; and the final assembly and packaging of our products and product candidates and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates. Our third-party manufacturers may also fail to pass the audits by our or our partners\u2019 internal quality and regulatory group. Any of these actions could delay or prevent our development of products, delay or prevent the submission of these products for regulatory approval, delay or prevent marketing approval, or result in insufficient product or product candidate quantity to support commercial demand or development. We may also be required to replace manufacturers, which would be time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to reach favorable agreements with or FDA approval for alternative manufacturers. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. See additional risk factors associated with manufacturing in the section \u201cRisks Related to Regulatory Matters.\u201d\nWe depend on Teva to manufacture the drug and finished packaged product and to distribute and commercialize the epinephrine auto-injector in the United States.\nWe have entered into a license, development and supply agreement with Teva, pursuant to which we developed and are the exclusive supplier of the device for an epinephrine auto injector product marketed by Teva in the United States. There is no guarantee that our partnership with Teva will be successful. Teva controls the manufacture and supply of the drug, epinephrine, and the final assembly of the devices and packaging of the finished product and has complete control over the commercialization and sale of the epinephrine auto injector product. If, at any time, Teva ceases to manufacture and supply the epinephrine drug or fails to produce sufficient supplies of the drug, Teva will be unable to produce a finished product and we may be unable to sell our auto injectors for this product to Teva resulting in less revenue for us.\nIn addition, if Teva is unable to complete the final assembly and packaging of the finished epinephrine auto injector product, we may receive less revenue than desired or expected. If Teva is unable to produce sufficient supplies of the drug or finished epinephrine auto injector product in accordance with the applicable manufacturing requirements or otherwise fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, Teva may be subject to regulatory enforcement action, which could impact its ability to produce, market, commercialize, sell, and distribute the finished drug product, and in turn, our revenue. We rely on Teva to commercialize and distribute the product, including determining the price and payer coverage. If Teva is unsuccessful in commercializing the product, the resulting revenue may be lower than expected. Additionally, Teva controls the business strategy, manufacturing and distribution decisions concerning the epinephrine auto injector product. Such decisions by Teva may be beyond our control and may impact the success of the epinephrine auto injector product. As a result, we may receive less revenue than desired or expected. Further, Teva is subject to potential competition regarding other generic versions of the epinephrine auto injector product, and such additional competition could result in receiving less revenue than expected.\nWe depend on Teva to manufacture and supply the drug for VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan and to distribute and commercialize the product in the United States.\nWe have entered into a license, supply and distribution agreement with Teva to distribute VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan, an auto injector product containing sumatriptan for the treatment of migraines. Under our arrangement, we will manufacture the auto injector and are responsible for final assembly and packaging of the final product and Teva will manufacture and supply the drug sumatriptan and distribute and commercialize the product in the United States. Teva also has an option for rights in other territories.\nThere is no guarantee that our partnership with Teva to distribute VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan will be successful. Teva controls the manufacture and supply of the drug, sumatriptan, which is necessary for the production of VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan. If, at any time, Teva ceases to manufacture and supply us with sumatriptan or fails to produce sufficient supplies of the drug, we will be unable to produce a finished product or sell our auto injectors designed for this product to Teva. In addition, if Teva is not able to produce sufficient supplies of the drug in accordance with cGMPs, we also will be unable to produce a finished product and we and/or Teva may be subject to regulatory enforcement action. We also rely on Teva to commercialize and distribute the product within the U.S. and if Teva is unsuccessful in commercializing the product, the resulting revenue may be lower than expected. Moreover, because we hold the FDA approved application for this product, we are responsible for FDA regulatory compliance. Should Teva fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, Teva or we may be subject to regulatory enforcement action. Any enforcement action could impact the ability to produce, market, commercialize, sell, and distribute the finished drug product, and in turn, our revenue. Additionally, we may disagree with Teva on certain business strategies or its manufacturing and distribution decisions. Such decisions by Teva may be beyond our control and may impact the success of VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan and we may receive less revenue than desired or expected. We have invested significant resources in the development of VIBEX\u00ae Sumatriptan, and, if our partnership with Teva is not profitable or is terminated for any reason, we may not receive a return on our investment and may suffer significant losses.\nWe depend on AMAG to manufacture and supply the progestin hormone drug Makena\u00ae, to distribute and commercialize the combination product that incorporates a variation of our VIBEX\u00ae QuickShot\u00ae subcutaneous auto injector for use with drug, and to maintain regulatory approval of the product.\nWe have entered into a license, development and supply agreement with AMAG to distribute a variation of our VIBEX\u00ae QuickShot\u00ae subcutaneous auto injector for use with AMAG\u2019s progestin hormone drug Makena\u00ae, the Makena\u00ae Auto Injector. Makena\u00ae was first approved by the FDA via the accelerated approval pathway in 2011. There is no guarantee that our partnership with AMAG will be successful, that AMAG will be able to maintain approval for Makena\u00ae or that AMAG will be able to successfully manufacture, supply, commercialize, and distribute the product. The FDA is currently seeking withdrawal of Makena\u00ae. For more information regarding Makena\u00ae and AMAG, see additional risk factors associated with information concerning our or our partners\u2019 products in this section.\nAdditionally, AMAG controls the manufacture and supply of the drug, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, and has complete control over the launch and continuous commercialization and marketing of Makena\u00ae Auto Injector worldwide. If, at any time, AMAG ceases to manufacture and supply us with hydroxyprogesterone caproate or fails to produce sufficient supplies of the drug, we will be unable to produce a finished product or sell our auto injectors for this product to AMAG. In addition, if AMAG is unable to produce sufficient supplies of the drug in accordance with cGMPs or otherwise fails to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, we also will be unable to produce a finished product and/or we and/or AMAG may be subject to regulatory enforcement action, which would impact the ability to produce, market, commercialize, sell, and distribute the finished drug product, and, in turn, impact our revenue. We rely on AMAG to commercialize and distribute the product worldwide and if AMAG is unsuccessful in commercializing the product, the resulting revenue may be lower than expected. Additionally, we may disagree with AMAG on certain business strategies or its manufacturing and distribution decisions. Such decisions by AMAG may be beyond our control and may impact the success of the Makena\u00ae Auto Injector and we may receive less revenue than desired or expected.\nWe and AMAG are subject to competition for generic versions of the intramuscular formulation of Makena\u00ae, which is less costly for patients. This competition could result in more patients utilizing the intramuscular formulation rather than the subcutaneous auto injector, thus resulting in us receiving potentially less revenue than expected.\nWe may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting or have in the past promoted the \u201coff-label\u201d use of drugs or medical devices, or otherwise promoted or marketed approved products in a manner inconsistent with the FDA\u2019s requirements.\nIn the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions, companies may not promote drugs or medical devices for \u201coff-label\u201d uses, that is, uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those that were approved or cleared by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies. Under what is known as the \u201cpractice of medicine,\u201d physicians and other healthcare practitioners may prescribe drug products and use medical devices for off-label or unapproved uses, and such uses are common across some medical specialties. Although the FDA does not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of medications, treatments or product uses, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations significantly restrict permissible communications on the subject of off-label uses of drug products and medical devices by pharmaceutical and medical device companies. As the sponsors of FDA approved products, we and our partners will not only be responsible for the actions of the companies but also can be held liable for the actions of employees and contractors, requiring that all employees and contractors engaging in regulated functions, such as product promotion, be adequately trained and monitored, which requires time and monetary expenditures.\nIf the FDA determines that a company has improperly promoted a product \u201coff label\u201d or otherwise not in accordance with the agency\u2019s promotional requirements, the FDA may issue a warning letter or seek other enforcement action to limit or restrict certain promotional activities or materials or seek to have product withdrawn from the market or seize product, among other enforcement requirements. In addition, a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil fines, criminal fines and penalties, civil damages and exclusion from federal funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and/or government contracting, consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements, as well as potential liability under the federal FCA and applicable state false claims acts. Conduct giving rise to such liability could also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by such conduct.\nMoreover, in addition to the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, there are other FDA restrictions on and requirements concerning product promotion and advertising, such as requirements that such communications be truthful and non-misleading and adequately supported. The FDA also has requirements concerning the distribution of drug samples. The FDA and other authorities may take the position that we are not in compliance with promotional, advertising, and marketing requirements, and, if such non-compliance is proven, we may be subject to significant liability, including but not limited to administrative, civil and criminal penalties and fines, in addition to regulatory enforcement actions.\nWe currently depend on a limited number of customers for the majority of our revenue, and the loss of any one of these customers could substantially reduce our revenue and impact our liquidity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 40% of our revenue from Teva. In addition, we derived a significant portion of our product sales revenue from wholesale distributors including McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health, which each accounted for approximately 12%, 12% and 11% of total revenues in 2020, respectively. The loss of any of these significant customers or partners or reduction in our business activities could cause our revenues to decrease significantly and increase our continuing losses from operations. If we do not broaden our customer base, we will continue to depend on these few customers for the majority of our revenues. Additionally, if we are unable to negotiate favorable business terms with these customers in the future, our revenues and gross profits may be insufficient to allow us to achieve and/or sustain profitability or continue operations.\nThe failure of our licensees to perform under any of our existing licensing agreements or the failure of our licensees/partners to develop and obtain regulatory approval for their product candidates or the failure to enter into new licensing agreements could substantially affect our revenue.\nOne of our business strategies is to enter into license agreements with pharmaceutical companies covering the development, manufacture, use and marketing of our drug delivery devices with specific drug therapies. Under these arrangements, the partners typically assist us in the development of the product and sponsor the collection of the appropriate data for submission for regulatory approval of the use of the drug delivery device with the licensed drug therapy. Our licensees may also be responsible for distribution and marketing of the product or technologies for these therapies either worldwide or in specific territories. We are currently a party to a number of such agreements, all of which are currently in varying stages of development. We may not be able to meet future milestones established in our agreements (such milestones generally being structured around satisfactory completion of certain phases of clinical development, regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product), and thus would not receive the fees expected from such arrangements, related future royalties or product sales. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing additional collaborative agreements or that existing or future agreements will result in increased sales of our drug delivery technologies or products. In such event, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, and our revenues and gross profits may be insufficient to allow us to achieve and/or sustain profitability.\nAs a result of our collaborative agreements, we are dependent upon the development, data collection and marketing efforts of our licensees. The amount and timing of resources such licensees devote to these efforts are not within our control, and such licensees could make material decisions regarding these efforts that could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. If one or more of these pharmaceutical company partners fail to pursue the development or marketing of, or are unable to receive marketing approval for our and our partners\u2019 products as planned, or fail to perform their contractual obligations in accordance with all regulatory requirements, our revenues and profits may not reach expectations or may decline. In addition, factors that adversely impact the introduction and level of sales of any drug or drug device covered by such licensing arrangements, including competition within the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, the timing of regulatory or other approvals and intellectual property litigation, may also negatively affect sales of our drug delivery technology. For instance, competition in this market could also force us or our partners to reduce the prices of our technologies below currently planned levels, which could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability. Moreover, our partners and licensees will be subject to many of the same regulatory risks as we are. To the extent that they are not able to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, or are not able to obtain or maintain regulatory product approvals, we and they may be subject to regulatory enforcement action, the performance of their obligations under their contracts with us may be inhibited, and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the relationship.\nWe are relying on partners such as Teva, AMAG, Pfizer and Idorsia for future milestone, sales and royalty revenue. Our partners may fail to obtain FDA or foreign approvals of a product with our technologies or may be unsuccessful in commercializing a product. There is no assurance that development of our partners\u2019 products will continue or that they will ultimately receive FDA approval in a timely manner or at all, or if FDA approved, they will be a significant revenue source for us. Significant delays in anticipated launches of these products in development may occur. While we assist our partners in some cases in obtaining regulatory approvals and advancing new products, we depend on these partners and cannot control their decision-making or progress in achieving such goals. Any potential loss of anticipated future revenue could have an adverse effect on our business and the value of your investment.\nAn increase in the number of competitors targeting generic and 505(b)(2) ANDA opportunities and seeking U.S. market exclusivity may adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nOur ability to achieve continued growth and profitability through sales of pharmaceuticals is dependent on our and our partners\u2019 continued success in challenging patents, developing non-infringing products or developing products with increased complexity to provide opportunities with U.S. market exclusivity or limited competition. There is substantial competition in the pharmaceutical industry. We and our partners will face competition from generic drug products, drug products that are similar to our or our partners\u2019 products, drug products containing the same active ingredient as our or our partners\u2019 products, and drug products for the same indication as our or our partners\u2019 products.\nOur or our partners\u2019 products may be eligible for periods of regulatory exclusivity, as described elsewhere in this annual report. This exclusivity, however, may not adequately protect our or our partners\u2019 products from competition. If any periods of exclusivity that we or our partners may have do not adequately protect the applicable product or if we or they do not receive or lose anticipated periods of regulatory exclusivity, we or they may be subject to abbreviated new drug application (\u201cANDA\u201d) and/or 505(b)(2) competition sooner than we anticipate. We or our partners may also be subject to increased generic competition sooner than anticipated as the FDA, Congress, and the Administration have taken steps to facilitate the approval of generic products and increase competition in the prescription drug market. New legislative and regulatory efforts could ultimately have an adverse impact on our business and results of operation.\nFurther, regardless of any granted exclusivities, we or our partners may face competition from products or product uses that are not otherwise blocked by our or our partners\u2019 patents or exclusivities. For example, exclusivity does not prevent physicians from prescribing a similar product even if it is not approved for the same indication. By further example, in 2019, the FDA approved Clarus Therapeutic, Inc.\u2019s product, Jatenzo\u00ae, an oral testosterone undecanoate capsule for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. The introduction of Jatenzo\u00ae, which was launched for commercial sale in February 2020, and other oral or competing testosterone products may materially impact our sales of XYOSTED\u00ae. Moreover, we or our partners may face competition from other products intended for the same use and/or that otherwise contain the same active ingredients, which may be less expensive than our or our partners\u2019 products. Any increase or changes in the competitive landscape for our or our partners\u2019 products may impact product sales and the amount that can be charged for a given product.\nAdditionally, the number of generic manufacturers targeting significant new generic opportunities with Hatch-Waxman exclusivity, or which are complex to develop, continues to increase. Other companies may also be developing drugs using the 505(b)(2) pathway that are substantially similar to our products and/or product candidates. The failure to successfully develop and commercialize highly complex products could adversely affect our sales and profitability. For instance, to the extent that another company receives a period of regulatory exclusivity, the FDA may not make our application effective during that company\u2019s exclusivity period. This would delay our and our partners\u2019 marketing of products and may prevent us or them from establishing a sufficient market share for our product. Similarly, should another company obtain FDA approval for a pharmaceutically equivalent product to one of our product candidates, we may no longer be able to use the 505(b)(2) pathway. In that case, it is the FDA\u2019s policy that the appropriate submission would be an ANDA. We may, however, not be able to immediately submit an ANDA or have an ANDA approval made effective, as we could be blocked by others\u2019 periods of patent and regulatory exclusivity protection.\nAlthough we have applied for and/or have received several patents and trademarks, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce patents for our products and device technologies and to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary information. If we cannot do so, our competitors may exploit our innovations and deprive us of the ability to realize revenues and profits from our developments.\nWe currently hold numerous patents and have numerous patent applications pending in the United States and other countries. Our current patents may not be valid or enforceable and may not protect us against competitors that challenge our patents, obtain their own patents that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business, or are able to otherwise circumvent our patents. Additionally, our products and technologies are complex and one patent may not be sufficient to protect our products where a series of patents may be needed. Further, we may not have the necessary financial resources to enforce or defend our patents or patent applications. Even issued patents may later be modified or declared invalid by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by analogous foreign offices or in legal proceedings. In addition, any patent applications we may have made or may make relating to inventions for our actual or potential products and technologies may not result in patents being issued or may result in patents that provide insufficient or incomplete coverage for our inventions.\nWe may seek to protect our patent rights by asserting an allegation of infringement against third parties. For instance, for any products approved via the NDA pathway, we will be required to submit certain patent information for inclusion in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book. There is no guarantee, however, that we will be able to obtain patents that may be included in the Orange Book. Moreover, the rules for submitting patents to the Orange Book are detailed and complex. To the extent that we do not include a patent in the Orange Book, we would not be able to avail ourselves of the protections provided in the Hatch Waxman Act, including the possibility of a 30-month stay. To the extent that we include a patent in the Orange Book that should not be included, we could also face legal action.\nIf third parties identify our products as reference listed drugs in any ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications, they will be required to provide patent certifications in their applications for our listed patents, and notifications to us. In the event such third parties make paragraph IV certifications, we would be entitled to file a patent infringement lawsuit, and if that is accomplished within 45 days after receiving the notification, it would trigger a 30-month stay against the FDA making the approval of the third party\u2019s application effective. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming and the outcome is uncertain. There is no assurance of success with any patent litigation. Depending on the ultimate outcome of the litigation it may have an adverse effect on results of operations and our market penetration. We may also determine that it is not in our business interest to file a patent infringement lawsuit in response to a paragraph IV certification.\nTo protect our trade secrets and proprietary technologies and processes, we rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure, or if others lawfully and independently develop the same or similar information. In addition, we may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties. We employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and if we do not prevail, we could be required to pay substantial damages and could lose rights to important intellectual property. Even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees.\nOthers may bring infringement claims against us, which could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and the outcomes could be uncertain.\nThird parties may claim that the manufacture, use or sale of our drug delivery technologies infringes their patent rights. As with any litigation where claims may be asserted, we may have to seek licenses, defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the courts. If these claims are not resolved favorably, we may not be able to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Even if we were able to obtain rights to a third party\u2019s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors potential access to the same intellectual property. If we are found liable for infringement or are not able to have these patents declared invalid or unenforceable, we may be liable for significant monetary damages, encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of products or methods of drug delivery covered by others\u2019 patents. Any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We may not have identified, or be able to identify in the future, U.S. or foreign patents that pose a risk of potential infringement claims. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our product candidates as a result of patent infringement claims, which could potentially harm our business.\nAdditionally, we are developing and may develop other products in the future for ourselves and/or our partners using the ANDA and/or 505(b)(2) pathways. Our partners may also do the same. There can be no assurance that those products will not be subject to litigation, which could delay or prohibit the launch of those potential products. We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our partners\u2019 products and/or product candidates and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights, including litigation resulting from filing under paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act. These lawsuits could claim that there are existing patent rights for such drugs and this type of litigation can be costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our commercialization partners are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our partners to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents. Moreover, regardless of whether we and/or our partners are ultimately successful in defending a patent infringement suit, we and/or they may be significantly delayed by a 30 month stay in the event we and/or they make a paragraph IV certification. In addition, a 505(b)(2) application or ANDA approval will not be made effective until any existing nonpatent exclusivity have expired or, if possible, is carved out from the label. Accordingly, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of one or more product candidates only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before such product candidates may be commercialized, if at all.\nProduct liability, product recalls and related claims could harm our business.\nThe development, manufacture, testing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products and medical devices are associated with significant risks of product liability claims or recalls. Side effects or adverse events known or reported to be associated with, or manufacturing defects in, the products sold by us could exacerbate a patient\u2019s condition or could result in serious injury or impairments or even death. This could result in product liability claims and/or recalls of one or more of our products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief for themselves, or by groups seeking to represent a class of injured patients. Further, third party payers, either individually or as a putative class, may bring actions seeking to recover monies spent on one of our products. While we have not had to defend against any product liability claims to date, as sales of our products increase, we may have product liability claims made against us. The risk of product liability claims may also increase if a company receives a warning letter from a regulatory or other enforcement agency. We cannot predict the frequency, outcome or cost to defend any such claims. Product liability insurance coverage is expensive, can be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Our product liability insurance may not cover all of the future liabilities we might incur in connection with the development, manufacture or sale of our products. In addition, we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts.\nWhile we maintain product and clinical trial liability insurance and evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis, a successful claim or claims brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Such claims could also harm our reputation and the reputation of our products, adversely affecting our ability to market our products successfully.\nProduct liability claims can also result in regulatory consequences, including, but not limited to investigations and regulatory enforcement actions, as well as recalls, revocation of approvals, or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions or changes. In addition, defending a product liability lawsuit is expensive and can divert the attention of key employees from operating our business. Such claims can also impact our ability to initiate or complete clinical trials.\nTo the extent that a product fails to conform to its specifications or comply with the applicable laws or regulations, we or our partners may be required to or may decide to voluntarily recall the product or regulatory authorities may request or require that we recall a product even if there is no immediate potential harm to a patient. Any recall of our products or products or their components that we supply to our partners could materially adversely affect our business by rendering us unable to sell those products or components for some time and by adversely affecting our reputation. Recalls are costly and take time and effort to administer. Even if a recall only initially relates to a single product, product batch, or a portion of a batch, recalls may later be expanded to additional products or batches or we or our partners may incur additional costs and need to dedicate additional efforts to investigate and rule out the potential for additional impacted products or batches. Moreover, if any of our partners recall a product due to an issue with a product or component that we supplied, they may claim that we are responsible for such issue and may seek to recover the costs related to such recall or be entitled to certain contractual remedies from us, Recalls may further result in decreased demand for our or our partners\u2019 products, could cause our partners or distributors to return products to us for which we may be required to provide refunds or replacement products, or could result in product shortages. Recalls may also require regulatory reporting and prompt regulators to conduct additional inspections of our or our partners\u2019 or contractors\u2019 facilities, which could result in findings of noncompliance and regulatory enforcement actions. A recall could also result in product liability claims by individuals and third-party payers. In addition, product liability claims or other safety issues could result in an investigation of the safety or efficacy of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities, or our marketing programs conducted by the FDA or the authorities of the EU member states. Such investigations could also potentially lead to a recall of our products or more serious enforcement actions, limitations on the indications for which they may be used, or suspension, variation, or withdrawal of approval. Any such regulatory action by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) or the competent authorities of the EU member states could lead to product liability lawsuits as well.\nWe depend on information technology and computer systems to operate our business, and any failures or interruptions in our internal computer systems, including a data breach or cybersecurity incident, could have a negative impact on our business.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future partners, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks including damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, attacks by computer hackers and ransomware, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our manufacturing activities, development programs and business operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, protected health or proprietary information, we could incur liability or damage to our reputation, and the further commercialization and development of our products and product candidates could be delayed. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, or trade secrets or the personal information of our employees, patients or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. There can be no assurance that our efforts, or the efforts of our partners and vendors, will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.\nOur corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable laws and regulations and we have incurred and will continue to incur costs relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nAs a pharmaceutical technology company, we are subject to a large body of legal and regulatory requirements, guidance, and recommendations from a variety of regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, the EMA, and HHS OIG. In addition, as a publicly traded company we are subject to significant regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices and continue to update the program in response to newly implemented regulatory requirements and guidance, we cannot ensure that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations. Failure to comply with all potentially applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of fines, cause the value of our common stock to decline, and impede our ability to raise capital or list our securities on certain securities exchanges.\nWe face uncertainty and risks related to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, which could significantly disrupt our operations and may materially and adversely impact our business and financial conditions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic (the \u201cPandemic\u201d) continues to evolve, including the spread of new more contagious virus strains, and the related risks and uncertainty could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial conditions.\nOur sales force has been subject to varying limitations on its ability to visit physicians, and we are utilizing virtual meeting platforms and other forms of social media to connect with our existing and potential customers and healthcare professionals. The restrictions and closures imposed as a result of the Pandemic have also limited patient access to physicians, and we have experienced, and may continue to experience, a decrease in new prescriptions for our proprietary products. Our partners may also experience a decrease in demand for our partnered products due to the Pandemic or the related restrictions. While we have taken measures to help minimize the potential impact of the various government orders, the effects of these restrictions may negatively impact productivity and demand for our products, disrupt our business and delay development programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These restrictions and others in the future, as well as the continued uncertainty on the duration, scope and severity of the Pandemic, could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe currently rely on many third parties to source active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug products, manufacture and assemble our devices, distribute finished products and provide various logistics activities for our business. If any of these third parties are adversely impacted by the Pandemic or the restrictions resulting from the outbreak, for example, one of our third party manufacturers\u2019 facility had a temporary shutdown as a result of a positive COVID-19 diagnosis by an employee, if they are not able to obtain necessary supplies, or if they need to prioritize other products or customers over us or our partners, we may experience delays or disruptions in our product supply chain which could have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, to the extent that we or our partners are conducting clinical trials, the Pandemic could cause delays or disruptions in these or future development programs. The foregoing may require that we consult with relevant review and ethics committees, Institutional Review Boards (\u201cIRBs\u201d) and the FDA, and could negatively impact our business.\nThe full extent to which the Pandemic may impact our business or the economy as a whole is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, such as the ultimate spread and rate of infection, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing requirements, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and in other countries to contain and treat the disease and to address its impact, including on financial markets or otherwise. These effects could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. To the extent the Pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section and in the \u201cRisk Factor\u201d section in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nOur and our partners\u2019 product candidates are subject to the inherent risk of product development and clinical trials, in that product development and clinical trials may not be successful, and they may not receive regulatory marketing approval on a timely basis or at all. If we or our partners fail to obtain, or have delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals for any product candidates, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe design, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical compounds and medical devices are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, including the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries and is an inherently risky and uncertain process. To conduct our and our partners\u2019 clinical and preclinical studies, we and they rely on third parties, including CROs and clinical trial sites to carry out the studies in accordance with the written protocol, the instructions, our and our partners\u2019 agreements with them, and the applicable regulatory requirements. There is no guarantee that we or our partners will be able to negotiate agreements with these third parties on acceptable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. To the extent that these third parties do not carry out their responsibilities, as is required, or to the extent that we, our partners, or such third parties terminate the applicable agreements, we or our partners may need to replace them, which may take significant time, effort, and expense. Additionally, we or our partners may be subject to regulatory enforcement action for such third parties\u2019, our, or our partners\u2019 actions, and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may find that the study data that is generated cannot form the basis for approval of a marketing application, requiring that we or our partners conduct additional preclinical and clinical studies. Moreover, investigators and CROs may be subject to conflicts of interest that compromise or appear to compromise the resulting data. Such third-parties may also have relationships with other entities that they may prioritize over the conduct of our or our partners\u2019 studies.\nDespite the time and expense associated with preclinical and clinical studies, failure can occur at any stage, and we or our partners could encounter problems that cause us or they to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies, chemistry, manufacturing and controls (\u201cCMC\u201d) studies or clinical trials. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates or that may increase the\ncost of development, including, failure to receive FDA or IRB authorization to begin or continue a trial, negative or inconclusive results, slow or insufficient subject enrollment, failure to obtain adequate clinical supply of product candidates that meet the applicable regulatory quality requirements, and failure by us, our partners, CROs, and clinical trial sites to follow the applicable regulatory requirements, including GCPs. We or our partners may also not have sufficient funding to conduct or complete a clinical trial or pay the substantial FDA application user fees.\nThe FDA and similar foreign authorities could also delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including because they: may not deem a product candidate to be adequately safe and effective or, in the case of a generic drug product, bioequivalent to the reference listed drug; may not find that we have adequately bridged to the reference listed drug, in the case of a 505(b)(2) application; may not find the data, including foreign data, from preclinical studies, CMC studies and clinical trials to be sufficient to support a claim of safety and efficacy; may interpret data from preclinical studies, CMC studies and clinical trials significantly differently than we or our partners do; may not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities associated with our product candidates; may not agree with the pathway that we or our partners have chosen for our product candidates, requiring us to pursue more difficult approval pathways, including submitting full NDAs, or may not agree with our or our partners\u2019 intended indications; may find that our or our partners reliance on a reference listed drug for an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application or literature for a 505(b)(2) application is not appropriate; may not agree with the design and/or implementation of our clinical and/or pre-clinical studies; may require us to conduct additional clinical and/or pre-clinical studies or gather additional information or data; may find safety or efficacy issues with respect to a reference listed drug, either before or after a product candidate\u2019s approval; may change approval policies (including with respect to our product candidates\u2019 class of drugs), or adopt new regulations; may not meet their review goal dates; or may not accept a submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission. Significant delays also could shorten any periods during which we or our partners may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates, which would allow competitors to bring products to market before we do.\nUndesirable side effects caused by any product candidate that we or our partners develop, a lack of bioequivalence for ANDA product candidates, and/or an inability to demonstrate product candidate efficacy could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or cause us or our partners to evaluate the future of our development programs. Undesirable side effects could also interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials. The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and inherently uncertain.\nOur and our partners\u2019 reliance on FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) and ANDA pathways may also impact the risk of development that we would not be subject to under a full NDA. These pathways are continually evolving. Based on evolving regulatory policies, we or our partners may not be able to use the 505(b)(2) or ANDA pathway in the future, requiring that we or they pursue the costlier and time consuming 505(b)(1) full NDA pathway. We or our partners may also face delays or impediments to the approval of any product candidates if a competitor files a citizen petition with the FDA. Moreover, any FDA intervening approvals of drug products that are the same or similar to our or our partners\u2019 product candidates could impact our potential market position and prospects, as well as impact the approval of our or our partners\u2019 product candidates. By example, should the FDA approve a product that is pharmaceutically equivalent to one of our or our partners\u2019 505(b)(2) NDA product candidates before we or they submit a marketing application, we or they would be required to change the marketing application to an ANDA application. Similarly, should FDA approve a product that is more similar to any of our or our partners\u2019 ANDA product candidates than the current reference listed drug, we or our partners may be required to change the reference listed drug for the ANDA. Either of these scenarios could require additional development work, and clinical or preclinical studies. FDA intervening approvals could also delay the timeframe within which we or our partners may submit product applications to the FDA or within which the FDA may make approvals of such applications effective, due to periods of patent protections and regulatory exclusivities for the newly approved product. Because the FDA cannot disclose whether such predicate product is under development or has been submitted at any time during another company\u2019s review cycle, we would not know whether there are any intervening products or applications until such product or application is approved.\nShould the FDA or another regulatory authority refuse to approve any of our or our partners\u2019 product candidates, we or they will be delayed in marketing, may need to conduct additional studies and collect additional data and information, and may need to make changes to the product candidates or their manufacturing processes, any of which could materially harm our business and results of operation. Moreover, if granted, any regulatory approvals may be subject to certain limits or other costly and burdensome requirements, such as labeled warnings, including box warnings, limitations on the indicated use, and post-approval requirements. The FDA also can withdraw product clearances and approvals for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if unforeseen problems follow initial marketing. Any limitation on use imposed by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies would adversely affect the marketing of these products and our ability to generate product revenue, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn other jurisdictions, we, and the pharmaceutical companies with which we are developing technologies (both drugs and devices), must obtain required regulatory approvals from regulatory agencies and comply with extensive regulations regarding safety and quality. If approvals to market the products are delayed, if we fail to receive these approvals, or if we lose previously received approvals, our revenues may not materialize or may decline. We may not be able to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals.\nAdditionally, clinical data that we generate or obtain from partners from FDA regulatory filings may not be sufficient for regulatory filings in other jurisdictions and we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining those regulatory approvals.\nBecause our and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates are considered to be drug/device combination products, the approval and post-approval requirements that we and they are required to comply with will be more complex.\nMost of our and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates are considered to be drug/device combination products by the FDA, consisting of a drug product and a drug delivery device. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its pre-market review and regulation based on a determination of the product\u2019s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the products, which means that the Center of Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the products\u2019 premarket development and review. These products and product candidates will be and have been subject to the FDA drug approval process, and will not require a separate FDA clearance or approval for the device component. Even though these products and product candidates will not require a separate FDA clearance or approval, both the drug and device centers within the FDA will review the marketing application for safety, the efficacy of both the drug and device component, including the design and reliability of the injector, and a number of other different areas, such as to ensure that the drug labeling adequately discloses all relevant information and risks, and to confirm that the instructions for use are accurate and easy to use. These reviews could increase the time needed for review completion of a successful application and may require additional studies, such as usage studies, to establish the validity of the instructions. Such reviews and requirements may extend the time necessary for the approval of drug-device combinations. In the case of combination product candidates for which we or our partners are seeking approval via the ANDA pathway, it is also possible that the agency may decide that the unique nature of combination products leads it to question the claims of bioequivalence and/or same labeling, resulting in the need to refile the application under Section 505(b)(2). This may result in delays in product approval and may cause us or our partners to incur additional costs associated with testing, including clinical trials. Approval via the 505(b)(2) pathway may also result in additional selling expenses and a decrease in market acceptance due to the lack of substitutability by pharmacies or formularies. In addition, approval under the 505(b)(2) or ANDA regulatory pathway is not a guarantee of an exclusive position for the approved product in the marketplace.\nFurther, although precedent and guidance exist for the approval of such combination products, there is no assurance that the FDA will not change what it requires or how it reviews submissions. Changes in review processes or the requirement for the study of combination products could delay anticipated launch dates or be cost prohibitive. Such delay or failure to launch these products or devices could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability. If our or our partners\u2019 combination product candidates are approved, we, our partners, and any of our respective contractors will be required to comply with FDA regulatory requirements related to both drugs and devices. For instance, drug/device combination products must comply with both the drug cGMPs and device QSRs. Depending on whether the drug and device components are at the same facility, however, the FDA regulations provide a streamlined method to comply with both sets of requirements. The FDA has specifically promulgated guidance on injectors, which discuss FDA\u2019s requirements with respect to marketing application and post-market injector design controls and reliability analyses. Additionally, drug/device combination products will be subject to additional FDA and constituent part reporting requirements. These requirements will require additional effort and monetary expenditure to ensure that our and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates.\nWe and our partners are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense for our and their approved and unapproved products. Failure to comply with these obligations could result in regulatory and/or legal consequences.\nOur and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by the FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies, including requirements related to research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing before and after product approval, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, deviation, approval, facility registration and product listing, the payment of user fees, advertising, marketing, promotion, sale, distribution, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical and medical device products. Because our and our partners\u2019 products and product candidates are drug/device combination products, we and they will have to comply with more regulatory requirements that would otherwise be required for products that are not combination products. Failure to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions. Moreover, were we or our partners to seek regulatory approval for additional indications or uses of any products that we or they may have already received marketing approval for, we or they would be subject to the risks of product development, including the failure to obtain regulatory approval. The applicable FDA, HHS and other governmental policies, laws, and regulations may also change and additional laws, policies, and regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or products, or that could impose additional regulatory obligations on us. By example, the change in administration in the U.S. may result in new regulatory, revised, postponed or frozen requirements and associated compliance obligations.\nThe FDA will continue to monitor products after approval for continued safety, efficacy, and compliance. We, our partners, and our independent contractors will also be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or that the drug is less effective than previously\nthought or other problems with our products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements both before and after approval, may yield various results, including warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, manufacturing and distribution restrictions, changes to product labeling, post-marketing study or other requirements such as REMS, refusal to approve marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of marketing application approvals, removal of the product from the market, labeling or promotional material modifications, product recalls, market withdrawals, field corrections, clinical holds and suspensions of clinical studies, fines, penalties, disgorgement, corporate integrity agreements, consent decrees, seizure, injunctions, prohibition on importing and exporting, dear healthcare provider letters, adverse publicity, FDA debarment, debarment from government contracts or refusal of orders under existing contracts, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs, among other consequences. Any of these events could have other material adverse effects on our operations and business.\nWe and our independent contractors, distributors, prescribers, and dispensers are required to comply with regulatory requirements related to controlled substances for XYOSTED\u00ae, which will require the expenditure of additional time and will incur additional expenses to maintain compliance.\nXYOSTED\u00ae is a drug/device combination product in which the drug product is testosterone, a Schedule III controlled substance. Accordingly, we, and our contractors, distributors, prescribers, and dispensers must comply with Federal controlled substances laws and regulations, enforced by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), as well as state-controlled substances laws and regulations enforced by state authorities. These requirements include, but are not limited to, registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, and other requirements. These requirements are enforced by the DEA through periodic inspections. Not only must continuous controlled substance registration be maintained, but compliance with the applicable controlled substance requirements will require significant efforts and expenditures, which could also inhibit the successful commercialization of XYOSTED\u00ae. If we and our contractors, distributors, prescribers, and dispensers do not comply with the applicable controlled substance requirements, we or they may be subject to administrative, civil or criminal enforcement, including civil penalties, refusals to renew necessary registrations, revocation of registrations, criminal proceedings, or consent decrees.\nAny relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers (actual and potential) and third-party payers in connection with our current and future business activities are and will continue to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, marketing expenditure tracking and disclosure (or \u201csunshine\u201d) laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings.\nOur business operations and activities may be directly, or indirectly, subject to various federal, state and local fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal FCA and similar laws in some state and foreign markets. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with principal investigators and research subjects, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by the federal government, state governments and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws in the U.S. that may affect our ability to operate are further discussed above in the \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d section of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict and these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together \u201cthe Healthcare Reform Act\u201d) substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Recently, the law\u2019s individual health insurance mandate was repealed and manufacturers\u2019 responsibility for the cost of prescriptions in the Medicare Part D donut hole has increased. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures at the federal and state level that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. For example, CMS recently has finalized a rule establishing a pricing model for Medicare Part B drugs based on the average price among other industrialized countries. This type of regulatory development, including if extended to other federal healthcare programs, could have a significant impact on our business.\nTo help patients afford our products XYOSTED\u00ae and OTREXUP\u00ae, we offer discount, rebate, and co-pay coupon programs. Co-pay coupon programs have received some negative publicity related to their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. CMS recently has issued a regulation imposing additional obligations on manufacturers in order to continue excluding such programs from government pricing calculations to avoid payment of increased Medicaid rebates. In recent years, other pharmaceutical manufacturers have been named in class action lawsuits challenging the legality of their co-pay programs under a variety of federal and state laws. In addition, at least one insurer has directed its network pharmacies to no longer accept co-pay coupons for certain specialty drugs the insurers identified. Our co-pay coupon programs could become the target of similar lawsuits or insurer actions. It is possible that the outcome of litigation against other manufacturers, changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay coupons, and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise negatively affect these programs.\nWe are dependent on third parties to decide to use our and our partners\u2019 products and to make them readily available at the point of care throughout their networks of pharmacies.\nIn addition to extensive internal efforts, the successful commercialization of our and our partners\u2019 products require many third parties, over which we have no control, to decide to use them, and to make them readily available at the point of care throughout their networks of pharmacies. These third parties include HMOs, long term care facilities, and pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which use pharmacy and therapeutics committees, commonly referred to as P&T committees, to make purchasing and reimbursement decisions. We cannot guarantee that we and/or our partners will be successful in getting the approvals we need from sufficient P&T committees quickly enough to maintain and grow sales of our or our partners\u2019 products.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate significantly, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe trading price for our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation, clinical trial results, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our partners or our competitors, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.\nWe are at risk of securities class action and similar litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. For example, on October 23, 2017, Randy Smith filed a complaint in the District of New Jersey, on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Antares securities against us, Robert F. Apple and Fred M. Powell. In addition, in January 2018, three stockholders filed separate derivative actions, one in the District of New Jersey and two in the Superior Court of New Jersey Chancery Division, Mercer County, purportedly on our behalf, against certain directors and officers, as well as the Company as a nominal defendant. There can be no assurance that we will ultimately prevail in these legal proceedings. Even if we are successful and ultimately prevail, litigation could be costly to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture conversions or exercises by holders of options could dilute our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 10.8 million stock options outstanding and exercisable, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.49 per share. Purchasers of our common stock could therefore experience dilution of their investment when and if the above options are exercised.\nSales of our common stock by our officers and directors may lower the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our officers and directors beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 10.4 million shares or 6% of our outstanding common stock, including stock options exercisable within 60 days. If our officers and directors, or other stockholders, sell a substantial amount of our common stock, it could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nIf we do not generate sufficient net taxable income in the future, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nAnti-takeover effects of certain certificate of incorporation and bylaw provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without action of our stockholders, to designate and issue preferred stock in one or more series, with such rights, preferences and privileges as the board of directors shall determine. In addition, our bylaws grant our board of directors the authority to adopt, amend or repeal all or any of our bylaws, subject to the power of the stockholders to change or repeal the bylaws. In addition, our bylaws limit who may call meetings of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 88905, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "ATRS"}
