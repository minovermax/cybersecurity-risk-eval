{"cik": "1580905", "company": "Installed Building Products, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are a number of business risks and uncertainties that affect our business. These risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results. We consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our business activities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may also adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.\nFor a summary of the following risks, please see \"Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors Summary\" which appears immediately prior to Item 1, Business, of this Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nOur business and the industry in which we operate are highly dependent on general and local economic conditions, the housing market, the level of new residential and commercial construction activity and other important factors, all of which are beyond our control.\nOur business is cyclical, seasonal and highly sensitive to economic and housing market conditions over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022the number of new home and commercial building construction starts;\n\u2022short- and long-term interest rates;\n\u2022inflation;\n\u2022employment levels and job and personal income growth;\n\u2022housing demand from population growth, household formation and other demographic changes;\n\u2022housing affordability;\n\u2022rental housing demand;\n\u2022availability and cost of labor;\n\u2022availability and cost of land;\n\u2022changes in material prices;\n\u2022local zoning and permitting processes, including the length of building cycles from permit to completion, based on local economic or environmental factors;\n\u2022federal, state and local energy efficiency programs, regulations, codes and standards;\n\u2022availability and pricing of mortgage financing for homebuyers and commercial financing for developers of multi-family homes and commercial projects;\n\u2022foreclosure rates;\n\u2022consumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular;\n\u2022U.S. and global financial system and credit market stability;\n\u2022federal government economic, trade, and spending laws and policies;\n\u2022private party and government mortgage loan programs and federal and state regulation, oversight and legal action regarding lending, appraisal, foreclosure and short sale practices;\n\u2022federal and state personal income tax rates and provisions, including provisions for the deduction of mortgage loan interest payments, state and local income and real estate taxes and other expenses;\n\u2022general economic conditions, including in the markets in which we compete; and\n\u2022pandemics, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism and response to these events.\nUnfavorable changes in any of the above conditions could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our business generally or be more prevalent or concentrated in particular markets in which we operate. Any deterioration in economic or housing market conditions or continuation of uncertain economic or housing market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nA downturn in the housing market could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn 2021, the U.S. Census Bureau reported an estimated 1.6 million non-seasonally adjusted total housing starts, up from 1.4 million starts in 2020. Despite the increase, any future decline in new home construction and resulting product demand levels may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In particular, increases in mortgage interest rates and rising home prices, along with other economic factors, may lead to a decline in the home construction market. The demand for residential construction could be negatively impacted if the number of renting households increases, as we have seen in the recent past, or by a shortage in the supply of affordable housing which could result in lower home ownership rates. Demand can also be negatively impacted by changing consumer tastes and demographic changes.\nOther factors that might impact growth in the homebuilding industry include: uncertainty in financial, credit and consumer lending markets amid slow growth or recessionary conditions; levels of mortgage repayment; limited credit availability; federal and state personal income tax rates and changes to the deductibility of certain state and local taxes; Federal Reserve policy changes; shortages of suitable building lots in many regions; shortages of experienced labor; soft housing demand in certain markets; and rising materials prices. Given these factors, we can provide no assurance that present growth trends will continue, whether overall or in our markets. The economic downturn in 2007-2010 severely affected our business. Another reduction in housing demand in the future could have a similar effect on our business.\nOur business relies on commercial construction activity, which has faced significant challenges and is dependent on business investment.\nA portion of the products we sell are for the commercial construction market. If this market does not grow in the future, the growth potential of our business, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. The commercial construction market, as measured by investment dollars, increased 8% in 2021 from 2020. However, this market has not rebounded from the pandemic as quickly as the new residential market as investment dollars in 2021 were below 2019 levels.\nAccording to Dodge Data & Analytics, commercial building starts in 2022, measured by investment dollars, are expected to increase 12% from 2021 while institutional building starts (a subset of the nonresidential construction market in which we participate) are expected to increase 6% from 2021.\nThe strength of the commercial construction market depends on business investment which is a function of many national, regional and local economic conditions beyond our control, including capital and credit availability for commercial construction projects, material costs, interest rates, employment rates, demand for office space due to COVID-19-related changes in employment practices, vacancy rates, labor and healthcare costs, fuel and other energy costs and changes in tax laws affecting the real estate industry. Adverse changes or continued uncertainty regarding these and other economic conditions could result in a decline or postponement in spending on commercial construction projects, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeakness in the commercial construction market would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Continued uncertainty about current economic conditions will continue to pose a risk to our businesses that serve the non-residential markets. If participants in these industries postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values or other factors such as unfavorable news surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, this could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products and services and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in the economy and/or a deterioration in expectations regarding the housing market or the commercial construction market could cause us to record significant non-cash impairment charges, which could negatively affect our earnings and reduce stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter. We also review our goodwill and other intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In doing so, we either assess qualitative factors or perform a detailed analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2021, 2020, or 2019; however, a decline in the expectation of our future performance, a decline in our market capitalization, deterioration in expectations regarding the general economy and/or the timing and the extent of new home construction, home improvement and commercial construction activity may cause us to recognize non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets, which are not determinable at this time. In addition, as a result of our acquisition strategy, we have recorded goodwill and may incur impairment charges in connection with prior and future acquisitions. If the value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired, our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2021, we had goodwill and other intangible assets in an aggregate amount of $586.9 million, or approximately 36% of our total assets, which is in excess of our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and competitive, and increased competitive pressure may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe building products installation industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We face significant competition from other national, regional and local companies. Any of these competitors may: (i) foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do; (ii) offer services that are deemed superior to ours; (iii) sell building products and services at a lower cost; (iv) develop stronger relationships with homebuilders and suppliers; (v) adapt more quickly to new technologies, new installation techniques or evolving customer requirements; or (vi) have access to financing on more favorable terms than we can obtain in the market. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with them. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn the event that increased demand leads to higher prices for the products we use in our business, we may have limited, if any, ability to pass on price increases in a timely manner or at all due to the fragmented and competitive nature of our industry. Residential homebuilders have, in the past, placed pressure on their suppliers to keep prices low, also contributing to the possibility of not being able to pass on price increases.\nProduct shortages or the loss of key suppliers could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers depends on our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers. We do not typically enter into long-term agreements with our suppliers but have done so from time to time, including in 2018 when we entered into a contract to provide a portion of the insulation materials we utilize across our\nbusinesses during 2019, 2020 and 2021. At this time, we do not have any agreements that exceed a one-year commitment in 2022. We have certain agreements that do not qualify as supply agreements due to a lack of a fixed price and/or lack of a fixed and determinable purchase quantity, but nonetheless may require us to purchase certain of our products from certain vendors, depending on the specific circumstances. Generally, our products are available from various sources and in sufficient quantities to meet our operating needs. However, the loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, unexpected events, such as incapacitation of supplier facilities due to extreme weather or fire, have temporarily reduced manufacturing capacity and production. The industry is currently experiencing manufacturer supply constraints for some of the materials we use in our business due to an unanticipated increase in demand as well as global supply chain bottlenecks caused by manufacturing curtailments due to COVID-19. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \"Key Factors Affecting our Operating Results\" for more information. In addition, during prior economic downturns in the housing industry, manufacturers have reduced capacity by closing plants and production lines within plants. Even if such capacity reductions are not permanent, there may be a delay in manufacturers\u2019 ability to increase capacity in times of rising demand. If the demand for products from manufacturers and other suppliers exceeds the available supply, we may be unable to source additional products in sufficient quantity or quality in a timely manner and the prices for the products that we use in our business could rise. These developments could affect our ability to take advantage of market opportunities and limit our growth prospects. We continually evaluate our supplier relationships and at any given time may move some or all of our purchases from one or more of our suppliers. There can be no assurance that any such action would have its intended effect.\nFailure by our suppliers to continue to provide us with products on commercially favorable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows. Our inability to source materials in a timely manner could also damage our relationships with our customers.\nChanges in the costs of the products we use in our business, an inability to increase our selling prices or a delay in the timing of such increases can decrease our profit margins.\nThe principal building products we use in our business have been subject to price changes in the past, some of which have been significant. For example, the industry supply of a portion of the insulation materials we install was disrupted due to historic winter storms in the southern United States during the first quarter of 2021. This event, coupled with other industry impacts such as sudden increased demand, resulted in insulation material allocation throughout the industry and, as a result, increased market pricing which impacted our results of operations in 2021 and will likely impact 2022 as well. Increased market pricing, regardless of the catalyst, could impact our results of operations in the future to the extent that price increases cannot be passed on to our customers. While we continue to work with our customers to adjust selling prices to offset the aforementioned higher costs, there can be no assurance that any such action would have its intended effect. In addition, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods can be, and have been, adversely affected by a delay between when building product cost increases are implemented and when we are able to increase prices for our products and services, if at all. Our supplier purchase prices often depend on volume requirements. If we do not meet these volume requirements, our costs could increase and our margins may be adversely affected. In addition, while we have been able to achieve cost savings through volume purchasing and our relationships with suppliers, we may not be able to continue to receive advantageous pricing for the products that we use in our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends on our key personnel.\nOur business results depend largely upon the continued contributions of our senior management team. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers other than Jeff Edwards, our Chief Executive Officer and President. Although Mr. Edwards\u2019 employment agreement requires him to devote the amount of time necessary to conduct our business and affairs, he is also permitted to engage in other business activities that do not create a conflict of interest or substantially interfere with his service to us, including non-competitive operational activities for his real estate development business. If we lose members of our management team, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the market price of our securities, could be adversely affected.\nOur business results also depend upon our branch managers and sales personnel, including those of companies recently acquired. While we customarily sign non-competition agreements, which typically continue for two years following the termination of employment, with our branch managers and sales personnel in order to maintain key customer relationships in our markets, such agreements do not protect us fully against competition from former employees.\nWe are dependent on attracting, training and retaining qualified employees while controlling labor costs.\nThe labor market for the construction industry is competitive, including within the sector in which we operate. We must attract, train and retain a large number of qualified employees to install our products while controlling related labor costs. We face significant competition for these employees from our industry as well as from other industries. Tighter labor markets may make it even more difficult for us to hire and retain installers and control labor costs. Our ability to attract qualified employees and control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including competitive wage rates and health and other insurance and benefit costs. A significant increase in competition, minimum wage or overtime rates in localities where we have employees could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we take steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs, expend resources responding to such increases and lower our margins.\nHigher labor and health care costs could adversely affect our business.\nOur labor costs have increased in recent years and may continue to increase as a result of competition, health and other insurance and benefit costs. In addition, health care coverage requirements, changes in workplace regulations and any future legislation could cause us to experience higher health care and labor costs in the future. Increased labor, health care and insurance costs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVariability in self-insurance liability estimates could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe carry insurance for risks including, but not limited to, workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property and our obligation for employee-related health care benefits. In most cases, these risks are insured under high deductible and/or high-retention programs that require us to carry highly subjective liability reserves on our balance sheet. We estimate these insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, including frequency, severity, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions, and periodically analyzing our historical trends with the assistance of external actuarial consultants. Our accruals for insurance reserves reflect these estimates and other management judgments, which are subject to variability. If our claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions and we then need to increase our reserves, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in union organizing activity and/or work stoppages could delay or reduce availability of products that we use in our business and increase our costs.\nCurrently, less than 4% percent of our employees are covered by collective bargaining or other similar labor agreements. However, if a larger number of our employees were to unionize, including in the wake of any future legislation that makes it easier for employees to unionize, or if we acquire an entity with a unionized workforce in the future, our business could be negatively affected. Any inability by us to negotiate collective bargaining arrangements could cause strikes or other work stoppages, and new contracts could result in increased operating costs. If any such strikes or other work stoppages occur, or if other employees become represented by a union, we could experience a disruption of our operations and higher labor costs.\nWe participate in various multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements in Washington, Oregon, California and Illinois with other companies in the construction industry. We also participate in various multiemployer health and welfare plans that cover both active and retired participants. These plans cover most of our union-represented employees. If a participating employer stops contributing to the multiemployer plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. In addition, if a participating employer chooses to stop participating in these multiemployer plans, the employer may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability based upon the underfunded status of the plan.\nIn addition, certain of our suppliers have unionized workforces and certain of our products are transported by unionized truckers. Strikes or work stoppages could result in slowdowns or closures of facilities where the products that we use in our business are manufactured or could affect the ability of our suppliers to deliver such products to us. Any interruption in the production or delivery of these products could delay or reduce availability of these products and increase our costs.\nIncreases in fuel costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe price of oil has fluctuated over the last few years, creating volatility in our fuel costs. We do not currently hedge our fuel costs. Increases in fuel costs can negatively impact our cost to deliver our products to our customers and thus increase our cost of sales. If we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to our customers to cover any increases in fuel costs, net income may be adversely affected.\nBecause we operate our business through highly dispersed locations across the United States, our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent practices and the operating results of individual branches may vary.\nWe operate our business through a network of highly dispersed locations throughout the United States, supported by executives and services at our corporate office, with local branch management retaining responsibility for day-to-day operations and adherence to applicable local laws. Our operating structure can make it difficult for us to coordinate procedures across our operations in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our branches may require significant oversight and coordination from our corporate office to support their growth. Inconsistent implementation of corporate strategy and policies at the local level could materially and adversely affect our overall profitability, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, the operating results of an individual branch may differ from those of another branch for a variety of reasons, including market size, management practices, competitive landscape, regulatory requirements, state and local taxes and local economic conditions. As a result, certain of our branches may experience higher or lower levels of growth than other branches. Therefore, our overall financial performance and results of operations may not be indicative of the performance and results of operations of any individual branch.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are required to obtain performance bonds and licensing bonds, the unavailability of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe are often required to obtain performance bonds and licensing bonds to secure our performance under certain contracts and other arrangements. In addition, the commercial construction end market also requires higher levels of performance bonding.\nOur ability to obtain performance bonds and licensing bonds primarily depends on our credit rating, capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers. The ability to obtain performance bonds and licensing bonds can also be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds and licensing bonds. If we are unable to obtain performance bonds and licensing bonds when required, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders regarding our environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nInvestor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, lenders and other market participants, shareholders, and customers have focused increasingly on the ESG or \u201csustainability\u201d practices of companies and have placed increasing importance on the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor, lender, or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our access to capital may be negatively impacted based on an assessment of our ESG practices. These limitations, in both the debt and equity markets, may negatively affect our ability to manage our liquidity, our ability to refinance existing debt, grow our businesses, implement our strategies, our results of operations, and the price of our common stock.\nWe released our inaugural ESG report in 2021. The report includes our policies and practices on a variety of social and environmental matters, including, diversity and inclusion initiatives, training and development programs, and employee health and safety practices as well as other sustainable business practices and environmental targets. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards or targets set forth in the sustainability report could negatively impact our reputation and stock price, employee retention, and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us.\nRISKS TO OUR BUSINESS FROM EXTERNAL THREATS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely impact the U.S. economy as well as our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d), in December 2019 China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province later identified as a novel strain of coronavirus. In response, the WHO declared the situation a pandemic and the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Many public health organizations and international, federal, state and local governments implemented measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 during 2020 and 2021. Some of\nthese measures included restrictions on movement such as quarantines, vaccine and/or masking requirements, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders and social distancing ordinances and restricting or prohibiting outright some or all forms of commercial and business activity. There is still significant uncertainty surrounding the duration and scope of the pandemic as well as its continued impact on the economy. We cannot predict if federal, state and local governments will implement additional restrictions, when restrictions currently in place will expire or whether restrictions currently in place will become more restrictive.\nCOVID-19 adversely affected many industries as well as the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the United States, causing a significant deceleration of economic activity during a portion of 2020. This slowdown reduced production, decreased the level of trade, and led to widespread corporate downsizing, causing a sharp increase in unemployment in 2020 from which the economy is still recovering. The continued impact of this pandemic on the U.S. and world economies is uncertain and these adverse impacts could worsen, impacting all segments of the global economy, and result in a significant recession or worse.\nOur business has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the global response. The Company and its customers\u2019 businesses were classified as \u201cessential\u201d businesses in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, permitting us to continue operations in most of our markets when COVID-19-related shutdowns occurred during 2020. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will continue to be classified as \u201cessential\u201d in the future, or that we will not voluntarily limit or cease operations in one or more of our markets if we believe it is in our best interest. For example, during portions of March, April and May of 2020, we saw a temporary but significant reduction in activity in our branches located in seven states and the Bay Area of California, which collectively accounted for 10% of our net revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. The reduced activity in these areas was attributable to construction being temporarily deemed non-essential during that time period. While operations have resumed to normal levels in all of these areas, future mandatory shutdowns or reductions in operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. During 2020, we laid off or furloughed approximately 600 employees in areas where construction was not deemed \u201cessential.\u201d We have since rehired or brought back substantially all of those employees, but we may need to layoff or furlough other employees in the future. Any employee layoffs or furloughs associated with future branch closures or slowdowns are assumed to be temporary in nature but could result in long-term labor shortages in certain markets if we cannot rehire these employees once operations resume. During the second half of 2021, new variants of COVID-19 emerged that were more contagious than previous variants and caused some of our local branches to be shut down or operations to be limited. We continue to assess this evolving situation and may adjust our policies and processes to continue to operate effectively.\nWhile the U.S. housing industry quickly rebounded from the initial onset of the pandemic in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse impact on our customers and the homebuilding industry in the future. Unemployment levels have stabilized, but inflation has been rising which could raise interest rates and may adversely affect consumer spending or consumer confidence, both of which would typically decrease demand for homes. In the commercial sector, we have experienced delays in the onset of certain large-scale infrastructure programs due to declining need for such structures and/or project funding declines. Commercial spending rose in 2021, but remains below 2019 levels. Commercial projects could decline in the future if consumer behaviors change in the wake of COVID-19 disruptions to the economy and changes to our general ways of life. For example, reduced demand for office buildings, decreased airport traffic or decreased usage of sports arenas could continue to impact our commercial end market.\nThe industry is currently experiencing manufacturer supply constraints for many of the materials we use in our business due to an unanticipated increase in demand as well as global supply chain bottlenecks as a result of manufacturing curtailments due to COVID-19. These factors affected our ability to complete installation work for certain customers during 2021 and also required us to source many of the materials we install from distributors and retail outlets at a premium. These higher costs had an adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. For example, we estimate our cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were approximately $8.8 million higher than they would have been if we purchased these materials through regular channels. We anticipate this trend of higher materials costs as a result of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to continue into 2022.\nOur management is focused on mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on our business and the risk to our employees, which has partially diverted management\u2019s attention away from normal business operations. Additionally, we have taken a number of precautionary measures intended to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business and the risk to our employees, including increasing the frequency of regular cleaning and disinfecting processes at our facilities, adhering to social distancing and mask protocols, limiting the number of workers in a branch or warehouse at any given time and periodically allowing employees to work remotely when possible, which could adversely affect our business. Despite these measures, our key management personnel and/or a portion of our installer base could be unable to work due to sickness or the need to quarantine, or become temporarily or permanently incapacitated by COVID-19 or related complications. This could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. While these and other measures we may take are believed\nto be temporary, they may continue until the pandemic is contained or indefinitely and could increase costs and amplify existing risks or introduce new risks that could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to, internal controls and cybersecurity risks.\nConsiderable uncertainty still surrounds COVID-19 and its duration and potential effects, as well as the extent of, and effectiveness of, any responses taken on a local, national and global level. To date, vaccines have been developed and treatments have improved, but it is too soon to know if they will protect against a worsening of the pandemic due to new variants of the virus or other factors, or to prevent COVID-19 from becoming endemic. While we expect the COVID-19 pandemic and related events may have a negative effect on us in the future, the full extent and scope of the impact on our business and industry, as well as national, regional and global markets and economies, depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, additional government actions taken in response to the pandemic, the impact on construction activity and demand for homes (based on employment levels, consumer spending and consumer confidence). Accordingly, our ability to conduct our business in the manner previously or currently expected could be materially and negatively affected, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur business is seasonal and may be affected by adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\nWe tend to have higher sales during the second half of the year as our homebuilder customers complete construction of homes placed under contract for sale in the traditionally stronger spring selling season. In addition, some of our larger branches operate in states impacted by winter weather and, as such, experience a slowdown in construction activity during inclement months. This winter slowdown contributes to traditionally lower sales and profitability in our first quarter.\nIn addition, climate change and/or adverse weather conditions, such as unusually prolonged cold conditions, rain, blizzards, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, other natural disasters, epidemics or other catastrophic events could accelerate, delay or halt construction or installation activity or impact our suppliers. For example, the February 2021 winter storms in the southern United States significantly impacted our operations across the entire state of Texas. The impact of these types of events on our business may adversely impact quarterly or annual net revenue, cash flows from operations and results of operations. Weather is one of the main reasons for annual seasonality cycles of our business, and any adverse weather conditions can enhance this seasonality.\nWe may be adversely affected by disruptions in our information technology systems.\nOur operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, including our web-enabled internal software technology, jobCORE. The jobCORE software provides in-depth operational and financial performance data from individual branch locations to the corporate office. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage customer orders on a timely basis, coordinate our sales and installation activities across locations and manage invoicing. As a result, the proper functioning of our information technology systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. Although our information technology systems are protected through physical and software safeguards, our information technology systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized access, delays and outages in our service, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, telecommunication failures, computer viruses and other problems. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or installing our products on a timely basis for our customers, which could adversely affect our reputation and customer relationships.\nIn the event of a cybersecurity incident, we could experience operational interruptions, incur substantial additional costs, become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation.\nIn addition to the disruptions that may occur in our information technology systems, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security policies, processes and defenses designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our information technology systems and information and disruption of our operations. Despite these efforts, our information technology systems, including but not limited to jobCORE, financial systems, Human Resource and payroll systems, fleet management software, and risk management systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and other costs. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation.\nAs cyberattacks become more sophisticated generally, we may be required to incur significant costs to strengthen our systems to protect against outside intrusions and/or continue to maintain insurance coverage related to the threat of such attacks. While we have invested in industry appropriate protections and monitoring practices of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and test our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches of our or our third-party providers\u2019 databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.\nWe carry cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate the financial exposure and related notification procedures in the event of intentional intrusion. The measures that we implement to reduce and mitigate these risks may not be effective. While to date these threats have not had a material impact on our business or operations, if such an event occurred, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTerrorist attacks or acts of war against the United States or increased domestic or international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nAdverse developments in the war on terrorism, terrorist attacks against the United States or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States and any foreign power may cause disruption to the economy. Since our business is dependent on the housing and construction industries, such adverse effects on the economy could negatively affect these industries and, therefore, our business, our employees and our customers, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR GROWTH STRATEGY\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully expand into new products or geographic markets and further diversify our business, which could negatively impact our future sales and results of operations.\nGenerally, we seek to acquire businesses that will complement, enhance, or expand our current business or product offerings, or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities into new or existing lines of business, including the expansion of our national footprint and end markets. Our business depends in part on our ability to diversify and grow our businesses and also expand the types of complementary building products that we install and sell. Our product and geographic expansion may not be successful and may not deliver expected results, which could negatively impact our future sales and results of operations.\nOur expansion into new geographic markets may present competitive, local market and other challenges that differ from current ones. We may be less familiar with the target customers and may face different or additional risks, as well as increased or unexpected costs, compared to existing operations. Expansion into new geographic markets may also bring us into direct competition with companies with whom we have little or no past experience as competitors. To the extent we rely upon expansion into new geographic markets for growth and do not meet the new challenges posed by such expansion, our future sales growth could be negatively impacted, our operating costs could increase, and our business operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions.\nAcquisitions are a core part of our strategy and we may be unable to continue to grow our business through acquisitions. In addition, acquired businesses may not perform in accordance with expectations, and our business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of acquired businesses may not prove to be correct. We may also be unable to achieve expected improvements or achievements in businesses that we acquire. The value of our common stock following the completion of an acquisition could be adversely affected if we are unable to realize the expected benefits from the acquisition on a timely basis or at all. Future acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, legal liabilities, goodwill impairments, increased interest expense and amortization expense and significant integration costs. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilution of existing stockholders if we issue shares of common stock as consideration.\nAcquisitions involve a number of special risks, including:\n\u2022our inability to manage acquired businesses or control integration costs and other costs relating to acquisitions;\n\u2022potential adverse short-term effects on operating results from increased costs, business disruption or otherwise;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022loss of suppliers, customers or other significant business partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022failure to retain existing key personnel of the acquired business and recruit qualified new employees at the location;\n\u2022failure to successfully implement infrastructure, logistics and systems integration;\n\u2022potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u2022risks associated with new lines of business and business models;\n\u2022risks associated with the internal controls of acquired businesses;\n\u2022exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition and inability to realize on any indemnification claims, including with respect to environmental and immigration claims;\n\u2022the risks inherent in the systems of the acquired business and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities; and\n\u2022our inability to obtain financing necessary to complete acquisitions on attractive terms or at all.\nOur strategy could be impeded if we do not identify, or face increased competition for, suitable acquisition candidates and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected if any of the foregoing factors were to occur.\nOur continued expansion into the commercial construction end market and other new lines of business could affect our revenue, margins, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn December 2021, we acquired a new entity with a different business model than our traditional installation business. See Note 19, Subsequent Events in the notes to our financial statements for additional information. This new line of business, our commercial construction end market business and any other future lines of business we may enter or acquire involve competitive, operational, financial and accounting challenges and other risks that differ from our traditional residential installation business. For example, the typical contractual terms and arrangements and billing cycle for the commercial construction end market are different than the residential new construction end market. In addition, our expansion into these businesses may include opening new branches that have higher start-up costs compared to our acquired branches. These factors and any other challenges we encounter could adversely affect our margins, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our estimated backlog associated with the commercial end market was approximately $143.2 million. In accordance with industry practice, many of our contracts are subject to cancellation, reduction, termination or suspension at the discretion of the customer in respect of work that has not yet been performed. In the event of a project cancellation, we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog but instead would collect revenues in respect of all work performed at the time of cancellation as well as all other costs and expenses incurred by us through such date. Projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project, delays in execution of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. Additionally, the risk of contracts in backlog being canceled, terminated or suspended generally increases at times, including as a result of periods of widespread macroeconomic and industry slowdown, weather, seasonality and many of the other factors impacting our business. Many of\nthe contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. The revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates. Therefore, the timing of performance on our individual contracts can affect our margins and future profitability. There can be no assurance that backlog will result in revenues within the expected timeframe, if at all.\nOur customers could purchase materials directly from manufacturers or other sources.\nWe do not have any exclusivity agreements with the manufacturers of the products that we sell. The manufacturers that we acquire products from could decide to invest more resources in selling their own products such as hiring salespeople and building distribution centers. Our ability to grow our business would be impacted and it could negatively affect future net sales and earnings. Additionally, if we are unable to secure favorable arrangements on the products we sell from our suppliers, we may not be able to offer competitive pricing to our customers.\nWe may be subject to claims arising from the operations of our various businesses for periods prior to the dates we acquired them.\nWe have consummated over 180 acquisitions. From time to time we are subject to claims or liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of acquired businesses for the periods prior to our acquisition of them, including environmental, employee-related and other liabilities and claims not covered by insurance. Any future claims or liabilities could be significant. Our ability to seek indemnification from the former owners of our acquired businesses for these claims or liabilities may be limited by various factors, including the specific time, monetary or other limitations contained in the respective acquisition agreements and the financial ability of the former owners to satisfy our indemnification claims. In addition, insurance companies may be unwilling to cover claims that have arisen from acquired businesses or locations, or claims may exceed the coverage limits that our acquired businesses had in effect prior to the date of acquisition. If we are unable to successfully obtain insurance coverage of third-party claims or enforce our indemnification rights against the former owners, or if the former owners are unable to satisfy their obligations for any reason, including because of their financial position, we could be held liable for the costs or obligations associated with such claims or liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nChanges in employment laws may adversely affect our business.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and impact operating costs. These laws include:\n\u2022employee classification as exempt or non-exempt for overtime and other purposes;\n\u2022workers\u2019 compensation rates;\n\u2022immigration status;\n\u2022mandatory health benefits;\n\u2022tax reporting; and\n\u2022other wage and benefit requirements.\nWe have significant exposure to changes in laws governing our relationships with our employees, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. Significant additional government-imposed increases in the preceding areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by changes in immigration laws or failure to properly verify the employment eligibility of our employees.\nSome states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws or enforcement programs, and the federal government from time to time considers and implements changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. These changes may increase our compliance and oversight obligations, which could subject us to\nadditional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we verify the employment eligibility status of all our employees, including through participation in the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program in the states that require it, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. In addition, use of the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and, if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized, we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees due to work authorization or other regulatory issues may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration laws. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, immigration laws have been an area of considerable political focus in recent years, and the U.S. Congress, Department of Homeland Security and the Executive Branch of the U.S. government from time to time consider or implement changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. Changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and potential liability and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. We are subject to regulations of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, and Department of Labor, and we are audited from time to time by these parties for compliance with work authentication requirements. While we believe we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, if we are found not to be in compliance as a result of any audits, we may be subject to fines or other remedial actions.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if pending or future legal claims against us are not resolved in our favor.\nWe are subject to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including wage and hour lawsuits. The ultimate resolution of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties. It is possible that the costs to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows for the periods in which the matters are resolved. Similarly, if additional claims are filed against us in the future, the negative outcome of one or more of such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to product liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, negligence, construction defect, breach of contract and other claims and legal proceedings.\nWe are subject to product liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, negligence, construction defect, breach of contract and other claims and legal proceedings relating to the products we install or manufacture that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with most of the products we use in our business. Other than for our manufacturer of cellulose insulation, we do not have direct control over the quality of such products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers. As such, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products.\nIn addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of our employees, homebuilders and other subcontractors, for which we may be contractually liable. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to fines, penalties and other liabilities in connection with injury or damage incurred in conjunction with the installation of our products. The nature and extent to which we use hazardous or flammable materials in our manufacturing processes creates risk of damage to persons and property that, if realized, could be material. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance, we may be unable to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. In addition, some liabilities may not be covered by our insurance.\nProduct liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, negligence, construction defect, breach of contract and other claims and legal proceedings can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, lawsuits relating to construction defects typically have statutes of limitations that can run as long as ten years. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in us and our services. Current or future claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information, see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nFederal, state, local and other laws and regulations could impose substantial costs and/or restrictions on our operations and could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and other laws and regulations, including, among other things, worker and workplace health and safety regulations promulgated by the OSHA, employment regulations promulgated by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and tax regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service and various other state and local tax authorities. Our primary manufacturing facility is also subject to additional laws and regulations which may increase our exposure to health and safety liabilities. In addition, we are subject to increased regulation of data privacy and information security, including the adoption of more stringent state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act, which goes into effect in January 2023. These types of data privacy and security laws, which continue to evolve, create a range of new compliance obligations for us and increase financial penalties for non-compliance. Additional or more burdensome regulatory requirements in these or other areas may increase our expenses, reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to offer services in certain geographies, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, our failure to comply with any of the regulatory requirements applicable to our business could subject us to substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur transportation operations, which we depend on to transport materials from our locations to job sites or customers, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the DOT. The DOT has broad administrative powers with respect to our transportation operations. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration or driver hours of service would increase our costs, which may increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows. If we fail to comply with DOT regulations or the regulations become more stringent, we could experience increased inspections, regulatory authorities could take remedial action, including imposing fines or shutting down our operations, and we could be subject to increased audit and compliance costs. We organize our transportation operations as a separate legal entity in certain states, including Ohio and Indiana, to take advantage of sales tax exemptions relating to vehicle operating costs. If legislation is enacted that modifies or eliminates these exemptions, our costs may increase. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the residential construction and commercial construction industries are subject to various federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, contractors\u2019 licensing, energy conservation and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements on the residential new construction industry or that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Regulatory restrictions and industry standards may require us to alter our installation processes and our sourcing, increase our operating expenses and limit the availability of suitable building lots for our customers, any of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental regulation and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that we operate our business, including each of our locations, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and maintain all material permits required under such laws and regulations to operate our business, we may be held liable or incur fines or penalties in connection with such requirements. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, including those related to energy use and climate change, may become more stringent over time, and any future laws and regulations could have a material impact on our operations or require us to incur material additional expenses to comply with any such future laws and regulations.\nOur primary manufacturing facility is also subject to additional laws and regulations which may increase our exposure to environmental liabilities. Despite providing a benefit to the environment by making structures more energy efficient, certain types of insulation, particularly spray foam applications, require our employees to handle potentially hazardous or toxic substances. While our employees who handle these and other potentially hazardous or toxic materials, including lead-based paint, receive specialized training and wear protective clothing, there is still a risk that they, or others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and others, including site occupants, and damage to our property or the property of others, including natural resource damage. Our personnel and others at our work sites are also at risk for other workplace-related injuries, including slips and falls.\nIn addition, as owners and lessees of real property, we may be held liable for, among other things, hazardous or toxic substances, including asbestos or petroleum products on, at, under or emanating from currently or formerly owned or operated properties, or any off-site disposal locations, or for any known or newly discovered environmental conditions at or relating to any of our properties, including those arising from activities conducted by previous occupants or at adjoining properties, without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for such release. We may be required to investigate, remove,\nremediate or monitor the presence or release of such hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. We may also be held liable for fines, penalties or damages, including for bodily injury, property damage and natural resource damage in connection with the presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. In addition, expenditures may be required in the future as a result of releases of, or exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions or changes in environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation or enforcement and, in certain instances, such expenditures may be material.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nWe have debt principal and interest payment requirements that may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our obligations.\nOur degree of leverage and level of interest expense may have important consequences, including:\n\u2022our leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared with our less leveraged competitors and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in any of our businesses;\n\u2022our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate may be limited;\n\u2022a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, future business opportunities or obligations to pay rent in respect of our operating leases; and\nOur ability to service our debt and other obligations will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow, and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds, to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategies. See Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \"Liquidity and Capital Resources, Credit Facilities.\"\nRestrictions in our existing credit facilities, senior notes, and any future facilities or any other indebtedness we may incur in the future, limit our ability to take certain actions and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the value of our common stock.\nOur credit facilities, or any future facilities we may enter into, the indenture governing our senior notes, or other indebtedness we may incur, impose certain restrictions and obligations on us. Under certain of these instruments, we must comply with defined covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;\n\u2022make distributions or dividends on or redeem or repurchase shares of common stock;\n\u2022make certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022make capital expenditures;\n\u2022incur certain liens or permit them to exist;\n\u2022enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022acquire, merge or consolidate with another company; or\n\u2022transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur credit facilities contain, and any future facilities or other debt instruments we may enter into may contain, covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios and meet certain tests, such as an excess cash flow test, fixed charge coverage ratio, leverage ratio or debt to earnings ratio. See Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \"Liquidity and Capital Resources, Credit Facilities.\" Our ability to comply with those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to comply with those ratios and tests when required to do so under the applicable debt instruments.\nThe provisions of our credit facilities, or other debt instruments, may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition,\na failure to comply with the provisions of our credit facilities, any future credit facility, the indenture governing our senior notes, or other debt instruments could result in a default or an event of default that could enable our lenders or other debt holders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and our stockholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.\nOur use of interest rate hedging instruments could expose us to risks and financial losses that may adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge the cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The purpose of these instruments is to substantially reduce exposure to market risks on our Term Loan. We designated our interest rate swaps in existence at the time of this Form 10-K as a cash flow hedge in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 815, Derivatives and Hedging. However, in the future, we may fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under these standards for a number of reasons, including if we fail to satisfy hedge documentation and hedge effectiveness assessment requirements or if our derivative instruments are not highly effective. If we fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, losses on the swaps caused by the change in its fair value would be recognized as part of net income, rather than being recognized as part of other comprehensive income. Any such adverse developments could result in material liabilities and expense and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInterest rate derivative instruments can be expensive and we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement or early termination of the agreements. In addition, our hedging transactions may expose us to certain risks and financial losses, including, among other things:\n\u2022the risk that the other parties to the agreements would not perform;\n\u2022the risk that the duration or amount of the hedges may not match the duration or amount of the related liability;\n\u2022the risk that the hedging instruments and the related liabilities do not transition to the same LIBOR replacement rate or that the timing or mechanics of such transition do not match between the hedging instruments and the related liabilities, in which case any such differences could decrease the effectiveness of the hedging instruments and increase our net liability;\n\u2022the risk that hedging transactions may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair values including downward adjustments which would affect our stockholders\u2019 equity; and\n\u2022the risk that we may not be able to meet the terms and conditions of the hedging instruments, in which case we may be required to settle the instruments prior to maturity with cash payments that could significantly affect our liquidity.\nIf we default on our obligations under the instruments governing our indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on our debt and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA failure by us to comply with the agreements governing our indebtedness, including, without limitation, our existing credit facilities or any future facilities, the indenture governing our senior notes and our other contractual obligations (including restrictive, financial and other covenants included therein), to pay our indebtedness and fixed costs or to post collateral (including under hedging arrangements) could result in a variety of material adverse consequences, including a default under our indebtedness and the exercise of remedies by our creditors, lessors and other contracting parties, and such defaults could trigger additional defaults under other indebtedness or agreements.\nAny such default under the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to make payments to pay principal of, or premium, if any, and interest on the senior notes, substantially decrease the market value of the senior notes and result in a cross-default under the senior notes. In the event of a default under our existing credit facilities or any future facilities or in respect of other indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness may be able to cause all of our available cash flow to be used to pay such indebtedness, may be able to terminate outstanding credit commitments and/or may be able to cease making loans to us and, in any event, could elect to declare all of the funds borrowed under the applicable agreement to be immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may need to seek waivers from the holders of our indebtedness to avoid being in default under the instruments governing such indebtedness. If we breach our covenants under our indebtedness, we may not be\nable to obtain a waiver from the holders of such indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all. If this occurs, we would be in default under such indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness and other lenders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nAdverse credit ratings could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to capital markets and commercial credit.\nMoody\u2019s Investor Service and Standard & Poor\u2019s routinely evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have assigned ratings for our long-term debt. If these rating agencies downgrade any of our current credit ratings, our borrowing costs could increase and our access to the capital and commercial credit markets could be adversely affected. Additionally, some rating agencies have started to incorporate ESG factors into their credit ratings. Unfavorable ESG ratings could have a negative impact on our access to and costs of capital.\nOur indebtedness exposes us to interest expense increases if interest rates increase.\nIf interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness, if any exists at the balance sheet date, would increase even though the amount borrowed would remain the same, and our net income and cash flows would correspondingly decrease. Specifically, we had no outstanding borrowings on our Revolver, as hereinafter defined, as of December 31, 2021, but should we have a balance in the future, we would incur interest based on a rate that varies per the conditions set forth in our agreement.\nIn addition, advances under our credit facilities generally bear interest based on, at our election, either the Eurodollar rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or the base rate (which approximated the prime rate) plus a margin based on the type of rate applied and leverage ratio. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) (\"FCA\") announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced in November 2020 a consultation regarding its intention to extend the publication of certain LIBOR settings, including the setting we use as a reference rate, to June 2023. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month USD LIBOR rates would continue to be published until June 30, 2023. The FCA is currently considering whether to use its powers to compel the publication of non-representative synthetic rates for one- month, three-month and six-month USD LIBOR beyond June 2023. Both our Term Loan Agreement, and our ABL Credit Agreement, as hereinafter defined, include a provision related to the potential discontinuance of LIBOR to be replaced with one or more Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") values or another alternate benchmark rate. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist after June 2023, the SOFR rates or other interest rates under the alternative rate could be higher than LIBOR. To the extent that these interest rates are higher, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur term loan bears interest at a variable rate, however interest rate hedges in place mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations associated with a portion of the outstanding debt balance. These derivative instruments are indexed to LIBOR, the value of which could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued. For some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative reference rate may be challenging, especially if we cannot agree with the respective counterparty about how to make the transition. If a contract is not transitioned to an alternative reference rate and LIBOR is discontinued, the impact on our contracts is likely to vary by contract. If LIBOR is discontinued or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. While we currently expect LIBOR to be available to us as a reference rate in substantially its current form until June 2023, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point. This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including industry and market conditions, our ability to successfully complete future business combinations and expansion of our existing operations. We anticipate that we may need to raise additional funds in order to grow our business and implement our business strategy. We anticipate that any such additional funds may be raised through equity or debt financings. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and will be subject to changes in interest rates and the capital markets environment. Even if we are able to raise capital through equity or debt financings, as to which there can be no assurance, the interest of existing stockholders in our company may be diluted, and the securities we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock or may otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing\nstockholders. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and your investment may decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by factors, such as:\n\u2022market conditions affecting the residential construction, commercial construction and building products industries;\n\u2022quarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u2022changes in government regulations;\n\u2022the announcement of acquisitions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in general economic and political conditions;\n\u2022volatility in the financial markets;\n\u2022results of our operations and the operations of others in our industry;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022the reduction, suspension or elimination of dividend payments;\n\u2022threatened or actual litigation and government investigations;\n\u2022the addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022actions taken by our stockholders, including the sale or disposition of their shares of our common stock;\n\u2022the extent of short-selling of shares of our common stock and the stock of our competitors; and\n\u2022differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts and changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections.\nThese and other factors may lower the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFurthermore, in recent years the stock market and the price of our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the price of our common stock and materially affect the value of your investment.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff.\nTesting and maintaining internal controls can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock or make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nWe have approximately 29.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2021. The shares of common stock are freely tradable, except for any shares of common stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, the sale of which will be restricted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 1.8 million of the 3.0 million shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan were available for issuance. These shares will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nJeff Edwards has significant ownership of our common stock and may have interests that conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Jeff Edwards beneficially owned approximately 17.8% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of his beneficial ownership of our common stock, he has sufficient voting power to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions, and he has significant influence over our management and policies. This concentration of voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares of common stock, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock. These actions may be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. The interests of Jeff Edwards may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and he may act in a manner that advances his best interests and not necessarily those of our other stockholders. In addition, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Jeff Edwards is permitted to pursue corporate opportunities for himself, rather than for us.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law could delay, discourage or prevent an acquisition of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could make it more difficult for our stockholders to change our management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove members of our board of directors. These provisions include a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms; no cumulative voting in director elections; the exclusive right of our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board; the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms without stockholder approval; a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; a requirement that a special meeting of stockholders be called only by a resolution duly adopted by our board; and advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors and management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then-current market price for their shares of our common stock.\nWe pay dividends to holders of our common stock, but may reduce, suspend, or eliminate dividend payments in the future.\nOur board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program in 2021. We also announced that our board of directors has approved our first annual variable dividend, payable on March 31, 2022 at a rate of 90 cents per common share.\nHowever, part of our business strategy includes retaining our future earnings, if any, in order to reinvest in the development and growth of our business, including our continued growth by acquisition strategy, and, therefore, we may reduce, suspend or eliminate dividend payments in the future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, the limits imposed by the terms of our credit facilities, or any then-existing debt instruments, and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, investors in our common stock may need to sell their shares to realize a return on their investment in our common stock, and investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices paid for them.\nIf securities analysts do not publish favorable reports about us or if we, or our industry, are the subject of unfavorable commentary, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading price for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports about us that are published by analysts in the financial industry. Analysts could issue negative commentary about us or our industry, or they could downgrade our common stock. We may also not receive sufficient research coverage or visibility in the market. Any of these factors could result in the decline of the trading price of our common stock, causing investors in our common stock to lose all or a portion of their investment.", "PERMNO": 14479, "SIC": 1700, "TIC": "IBP"}
