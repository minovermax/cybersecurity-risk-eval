{"cik": "1417398", "company": "Hillenbrand, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-11-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn this section of the Form 10-K, we describe the risks we believe are most important for you to think about when you consider investing in, selling, or owning securities. This information should be assessed along with the other information we provide you in this Form 10-K and that we file from time to time with the SEC. Like most companies, our business involves risks. The risks described below are not the only risks we face, but these are the ones we currently think have the potential to significantly\naffect stakeholders in our Company if they were to develop adversely (due to size, volatility, or both). We exclude risks that we believe are inherent in all businesses broadly as a function of simply being \u201cin business.\u201d Additional risks not currently known or considered immaterial by us at this time and thus not listed below could also result in adverse effects on our business. We have assigned the risks into categories to help you understand from where they emanate (e.g. the overall Company or a specific segment).\nRisks Related to Hillenbrand\n1.A key component of our growth strategy is making significant acquisitions, some of which may be outside the industries in which we currently operate. We may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from these acquisitions. If an acquisition were to perform unfavorably, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nAll acquisitions involve inherent uncertainties, which may include, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully identify the most suitable targets for acquisition;\n\u2022\nnegotiate reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nproperly perform due diligence and determine all the significant risks associated with a particular acquisition;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully transition the acquired company into our business and achieve the desired performance;\n\u2022\navoid diversion of Company management\u2019s attention from other important business activities; and\n\u2022\nwhere applicable, implement restructuring activities without an adverse impact to business operations.\nWe may acquire businesses with unknown liabilities, contingent liabilities, internal control deficiencies, or other risks. We have plans and procedures to review potential acquisition candidates for a variety of due diligence matters, including compliance with applicable regulations and laws prior to acquisition. Despite these efforts, realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position, or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.\nWe generally seek indemnification from sellers covering these matters; however, the liability of the sellers is often limited, and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot be assured that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.\nWe may not achieve the intended benefits of our acquisitions. Under such circumstances, management could be required to spend significant amounts of time and resources in the transition of the acquired business, and we may not fully realize benefits anticipated from application of the HOM. We may also decide to sell previously acquired businesses, or portions thereof, that no longer meet our strategic objectives, potentially resulting in a loss, accounting charge, or other negative impact. As a result of these factors, our business, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially impacted.\nIf we acquire a company that operates in an industry that is different from the ones in which we currently operate, our lack of experience with that company\u2019s industry could have a material adverse impact on our ability to manage that business and realize the benefits of that acquisition.\n2.Global market and economic conditions, including those related to the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Continuing uncertainties in the eurozone, including future implications from the voluntary exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and uncertainties in China and emerging markets may depress demand in these areas and create additional risk to our financial results.\nInstability in the global economy and financial markets can adversely affect our business in several ways, including limiting our customers\u2019 ability to obtain sufficient credit or pay for our products within the terms of sale. Competition could further intensify among the manufacturers and distributors with whom we compete for volume and market share, resulting in lower net revenue due to steeper discounts and product mix-down. In particular, if certain key or sole suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies.\nSubstantial losses in the equity markets could have an adverse effect on the assets of the Company\u2019s pension plans. Volatility of interest rates and negative equity returns could require greater contributions to the defined benefit plans in the future.\n3.International economic, political, legal, and business factors could negatively affect our operating results, cash flows, financial condition, and growth.\nWe derived approximately 48%, 44%, and 44% of our revenue from our operations outside the U.S. for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016. This revenue is primarily generated in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, South America, and Canada. In addition, we have manufacturing operations, suppliers, and employees located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S., we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., including in emerging markets.\nOur international business is subject to risks that are often encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:\n\u2022\ninterruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers, including conditions where recovery from natural disasters may be delayed due to country-specific infrastructure and resources;\n\u2022\ndifferences in terms of sale, including payment terms;\n\u2022\nlocal product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic condition, including with respect to safety and health issues;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including unfavorable changes with respect to tax, trade, or sanctions compliance matters;\n\u2022\nlimitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contract and property rights under local law;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and\n\u2022\ndiffering protection of intellectual property.\nSuch risks may be more likely or pronounced in emerging markets, where our operations may be subject to greater uncertainty due to increased volatility associated with the developing nature of their economic, legal, and governmental systems.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n4.\nUncertainty in the United States political environment and in trade policy could negatively impact our business.\nThe political environment in the United States has created significant uncertainty with respect to, and has resulted in and could result in additional changes in, legislation, regulation, international relations, and government policy. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such additional changes will occur, changes at the local, state or federal level could significantly impact our business and the industries in which we compete. Specific legislative and regulatory developments and proposals that could have a material impact on us involve matters including (but not limited to) changes to existing trade agreements or entry into new trade agreements, sanctions policies, import and export regulations, tariffs, taxes and customs duties, public company reporting requirements, environmental regulation, and antitrust enforcement. In addition, certain countries that are central to our businesses have imposed and/or been subject to imposition or have threatened imposition of retaliatory tariffs in response to tariffs imposed by the U.S. upon various raw materials and finished goods, including steel and others that are important to our businesses. To the extent changes in the political or regulatory environment have a negative impact on the Company or the markets in which we operate, it may materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition in the periods to come.\nThe U.S. government has at times indicated a willingness to significantly change, and has in some cases significantly changed, trade policies and/or agreements. This exposes us to risks of disruption and cost increases in our established patterns for sourcing our raw materials, and creates increased uncertainties in planning our sourcing strategies and forecasting our margins. Changes in U.S. tariffs, quotas, trade relationships or agreements, or tax law could reduce the supply of goods available to us or increase our cost of goods. Although such changes would in many cases have implications across the entire industry, we may fail to effectively adapt to and manage the adjustments in strategy that would be necessary in response to those changes. In addition to the general uncertainty and overall risk from potential changes in U.S. laws and policies, as we make business decisions in the face of uncertainty, we may incorrectly anticipate the outcomes, miss out on business opportunities or fail to\neffectively adapt our business strategies and manage the adjustments that are necessary in response to those changes. These risks could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition in the periods to come.\n5.We rely upon our employees, agents, and business partners to comply with laws in many different countries and jurisdictions. We establish policies and provide training to assist them in understanding our policies and the regulations most applicable to our business; however, our reputation, ability to do business, and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by these parties.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback, false claims, competition, export and import compliance, trade sanctions promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), anti-money laundering, and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions; could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and related shareholder lawsuits; could cause us to incur significant legal fees; and could damage our reputation.\n6.We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. The Company\u2019s predominant exposures are in European, Canadian, Swiss, Mexican, and Asian currencies, including the Chinese Renminbi. In preparing financial statements for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated using weighted-average exchange rates. With respect to the effects on translated earnings, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to local currencies, the Company\u2019s earnings could be negatively impacted. Although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.\n7.Increased prices for, or unavailability of, raw materials used in our products could adversely affect profitability.\nOur profitability is affected by the prices of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. These prices fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, fuel-related delivery costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates, and, in some cases, government regulation. Significant increases in the prices of raw materials that cannot be recovered through increases in the price of our products could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot guarantee that the prices we are paying for raw materials today will continue in the future or that the marketplace will continue to support current prices for our products or that such prices can be adjusted to fully or partially offset raw material price increases in the future. Any increases in prices resulting from a tightening supply of these or other commodities could adversely affect our profitability. We do not engage in hedging transactions for raw material purchases, but we do enter into some fixed-price supply contracts.\nOur dependency upon regular deliveries of supplies from particular suppliers means that interruptions or stoppages in such deliveries could adversely affect our operations until arrangements with alternate suppliers could be made. Several of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products currently are procured from a single source. If any of these sole-source suppliers were unable to deliver these materials for an extended period of time as a result of financial difficulties, catastrophic events affecting their facilities, or other factors, or if we were unable to negotiate acceptable terms for the supply of materials with these sole-source suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. We may not be able to find acceptable alternatives, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs. Extended unavailability of a necessary raw material could cause us to cease manufacturing one or more products for a period of time, which could also lead to loss of customers.\n8. The Company could face labor disruptions that would interfere with operations.\nAs of September 30, 2018, approximately 42% of Hillenbrand\u2019s employees work under collective bargaining agreements. Although we have not experienced any significant work stoppages in the past 20 years as a result of labor disagreements, we cannot ensure that such a stoppage will not occur in the future. Inability to negotiate satisfactory new agreements or a labor disturbance at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n9. Increasing competition for highly skilled and talented workers could adversely affect our business.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain a skilled workforce. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on a thoroughly trained and highly skilled workforce, including, for example, our engineers. In many of the geographies where we operate, we face a potential shortage of qualified employees. The increasing competition for highly skilled and talented employees could result in higher compensation costs, difficulties in maintaining a capable workforce, and leadership succession planning challenges. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n10. We are involved from time to time in claims, lawsuits, and governmental proceedings relating to our operations, including environmental, antitrust, patent infringement, business practices, commercial transactions, and other matters. The ultimate outcome of these claims, lawsuits, and governmental proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty but could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to other potential claims, including product and general liability, workers compensation, auto liability, and employment-related matters. While we maintain insurance for certain of these exposures, the policies in place are often high-deductible policies. It is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to litigation or other potential claims, and the ultimate outcome of claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For a more detailed discussion of claims, see Note 11 to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\n11. Our capital allocation strategy could result in a significant amount of debt, which could adversely affect the Company and limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or make future desirable acquisitions.\nAs of September 30, 2018, our outstanding debt was $344.6. This level of debt and additional debt we may incur in the future could have important consequences to our businesses. For example:\n\u2022\nWe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, because we have lower borrowing capacity.\n\u2022\nWe may be required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts and acquisitions.\n\u2022\nWe will continue to be exposed to the risk of increased interest rates, because a portion of our borrowings is at variable rates of interest.\n\u2022\nWe may be more limited in our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which they operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness.\n\u2022\nWe may be more vulnerable to credit rating downgrades which could have an impact on our ability to secure future financing at attractive interest rates.\n12. The performance of the Company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology, cyber-attacks, or catastrophic losses affecting infrastructure.\nThe Company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions. Computer systems are important to production planning, customer service, and order management, as well as other critical processes.\nDespite efforts to prevent such situations and the existence of established risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks, the Company\u2019s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from, among other causes, power outages, system failures, or computer viruses. Computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations, such as email, telephone and other functionality, is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various geographies in which the Company operates.\nIn addition, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of the Company\u2019s information technology systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality and integrity of the Company\u2019s data. Cyber-attacks, security breaches, and other cyber incidents could include, among other things, computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), hacking, denial-of-service attacks, and other attacks. Sensitive information is also stored by our vendors and on the platforms and networks of third-party providers. Cyber-attacks on the Company, our vendors, or our third-party providers could result in inappropriate access to intellectual property, personally identifiable information of our global workforce, suppliers, or customers, or personal credit card or other payment information of our customers. Potential consequences of a successful cyber-attack or other cybersecurity incident include remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack, litigation and legal risks including governmental or regulatory enforcement actions, increased insurance premiums, reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence, and damage to the Company\u2019s competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value. While we have taken steps to maintain and enhance the appropriate cybersecurity and address these risks by implementing enhanced security technologies, internal controls, and business continuity plans, these measures may not be adequate.\nRegulators globally are increasingly imposing greater fines and penalties for privacy and data protection violations. For example, in 2018 the European Union enacted a new and expanded set of compliance requirements on companies, like ours, that collect or process personal data from citizens living in the European Union. Failure to comply with these or other data protection regulations could expose us to potentially significant liabilities. If the Company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to security breaches, and if business continuity plans do not effectively address these issues on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruption in its ability to manage operations, as well as reputational, competitive, or business harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n13. The effective tax rate of the Company may be negatively impacted by economic downturns as well as future changes to tax laws in global jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various other global jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, or if there is a change to the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in a material increase in our effective tax rate.\nIn addition, the recently enacted Tax Act makes significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Such changes include a reduction in the domestic corporate tax rate, limitations on certain corporate deductions and credits, and a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the \u201cTransition Tax\u201d). Some of the Tax Act changes could have a negative impact on our business. The estimated impact of the new law is based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions; recognized 2018 impacts could be materially different from current provisional amounts based on our further analysis of our international operations and data gathering efforts. We continue to analyze the impacts of certain provisions of the Tax Act as it pertains to provisions that are effective beginning with our fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. Changes in other tax laws or tax rulings could also have a material impact on our effective tax rate. Additionally, many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. Certain proposals could include recommendations that could increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business. Any changes in the taxation of our activities in such jurisdictions may result in a material increase in our effective tax rate.\n14. Provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws and facets of Indiana law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, as well as Indiana law, contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of our shareholders. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our Company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable our Board of Directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that the Board of Directors believes is\nnot in the best interests of shareholders, but which some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests.\nThese provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe division of our Board of Directors into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our shareholders to act by less than unanimous written consent;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors.\nIndiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe believe these provisions are important for a public company and protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise potentially unfair takeover tactics by encouraging potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with appropriate time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make our Company immune from takeovers; however, they may apply if the Board of Directors determines that a takeover offer is not in the best interests of our shareholders, even if some shareholders believe the offer to be beneficial.\nRisks Related to the Process Equipment Group\n1.A significant portion of our investments in the Process Equipment Group includes goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to periodic impairment evaluations. An impairment loss on these assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe acquired intangible assets with the acquisitions of Coperion, K-Tron (including TerraSource Global), Rotex, Abel, and Red Valve, portions of which were identified as either goodwill or indefinite-lived assets. We periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures, and market capitalization declines may impair these assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.\n2.The Process Equipment Group operates in cyclical industries.\nAs an industrial capital goods supplier, the Process Equipment Group serves industries that are cyclical. During periods of economic expansion, when capital spending normally increases, the Process Equipment Group generally benefits from greater demand for its products. During periods of economic contraction, when capital spending normally decreases, the Process Equipment Group generally is adversely affected by declining demand for new equipment orders, and it may be subject to increases in uncollectible receivables from customers who become insolvent. There can be no assurance that economic expansion or increased demand will be sustainable, and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n3.The Process Equipment Group derives significant revenues from the plastics industry. Any decrease in demand for plastics or equipment used in the plastics industry, changes in technological advances, and changes in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Process Equipment Group sells equipment, including extruders and compounding systems, to the plastics industry. Sales volume is tied to the need for equipment used to produce plastics products, which may be significantly influenced by the demand for plastics, the capital investment needs of companies in the plastics industry, changes in technological advances, and changes in laws or regulations. As a result, any downturn in or disruption to the plastics industry or decrease in the demand for plastics could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n4.The Process Equipment Group derives revenues from the energy industry. Any decrease in demand for electricity, oil, natural gas, coal, and mining equipment or an increase in regulation of the energy industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA portion of the Process Equipment Group\u2019s sales are affected by the consumption of resources including oil, natural gas, and coal. The demand for oil, natural gas, coal, and mining equipment is dependent upon, among other things, the availability and cost of alternative sources of energy, such as solar, wind, or nuclear power. Additionally, the cost of compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations on the energy industry may impact the demand for our products. As a result, any downturn in or disruption to the oil, natural gas, or international coal and mining industries or decrease in the demand for electricity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Batesville\n1.Continued fluctuations in mortality rates and increased cremations may adversely affect the sales volume of our burial caskets.\nThe life expectancy of U.S. citizens has increased since the 1950s. However, we do anticipate a modest increase in deaths for the foreseeable future driven by the aging U.S. population.\nCremations as a percentage of total U.S. deaths have increased steadily since the 1960s and are expected to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. The increase in the number of cremations in the U.S. has resulted in a contraction in the demand for burial caskets. This has been a contributing factor to lower burial casket sales volumes for Batesville in recent years. We expect these trends will continue in the foreseeable future and will likely continue to negatively impact burial casket volumes.\nFinally, the number of deaths can vary over short periods of time and among different geographical areas due to a variety of factors, including the timing and severity of seasonal outbreaks of illnesses such as pneumonia and influenza. Such variations could cause the sale of burial caskets and cremation products to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n2.Batesville\u2019s business is dependent on several major contracts with large national funeral providers. The relationships with these customers pose several risks.\nBatesville has contracts with a number of national funeral home customers that constitute a sizeable portion of its overall sales volume. Also, while contracts with national funeral service providers give Batesville important access to purchasers of death care products, they may obligate Batesville to sell products at contracted prices for extended periods of time, therefore limiting Batesville\u2019s ability, in the short or medium term, to raise prices in response to significant increases in raw material prices or other factors. Any decision by national funeral home customers to discontinue or limit purchases from Batesville could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n3.Batesville is facing competition from caskets manufactured abroad and imported into North America and from a number of non-traditional sources.\nSome foreign casket manufacturers, mostly from China, import caskets into the U.S. and Canada. In addition, non-traditional death care product providers, such as large discount retail stores, casket stores, and internet casket retailers could present more of a competitive threat to Batesville and its sales channel than is currently anticipated. Sales from these foreign and non-traditional providers currently represent less than 10% of total casket sales in North America, but this percentage could grow. It is not possible to quantify the financial impact that these competitors will have on Batesville in the future. These competitors and any new entrants into the funeral products business may drive pricing and other competitive actions in an industry that already has domestic production over-capacity. Such competitive developments could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 92597, "SIC": 3530, "TIC": "HI"}
