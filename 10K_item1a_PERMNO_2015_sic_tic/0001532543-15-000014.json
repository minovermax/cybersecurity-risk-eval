{"cik": "1532543", "company": "EveryWare Global, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe caution readers that our business activities involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently expected by us. If any of such risks and uncertainties were to actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The most significant of those risks are:\nRisks Related to Filing Under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code\nWe have filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in accordance with the terms of the RSA. As a result, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings.\nWe have filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Filing\u201d) in accordance with the terms of the RSA. For the duration of the Chapter 11 proceedings, we will be subject to various risks including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, consummate and implement the Plan with respect to the Chapter 11 proceedings;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court and creditor approval of the Plan;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to our motions in the Chapter 11 proceedings and the outcomes of Bankruptcy Court rulings and of the Chapter 11 proceedings in general;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with third-party motions in the Chapter 11 proceedings, which may interfere with our ability to formulate and implement the Plan;\n\u2022\nincreased costs related to the Chapter 11 proceedings;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources to fund the Plan and meet future obligations;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain key employees;\n\u2022\nthe disposition or resolution of all pre-petition claims against us; and\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain existing customers and vendor relationships and expand sales to new customers.\nWe will also be subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties who have interests in the Chapter 11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with our plans. In addition, the Chapter 11 proceedings subject us to risks related to litigation and/or claims asserted by creditors or other stakeholders in the Chapter 11 proceedings. These risks and uncertainties could affect us in various ways and may significantly increase the time it has to operate under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 proceedings, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 proceedings may have on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe duration of the Chapter 11 proceedings is difficult to estimate and could be lengthy. If we fail to consummate the Plan, a non-prearranged proceeding under Chapter 11 would delay our emergence from bankruptcy.\nThe Plan results in limited recovery for holders of our existing common stock and preferred stock. If certain of our stockholders fail to comply with the RSA, our stockholders will not receive any of our new common stock or releases under the Plan.\nUnder the terms of the Plan, the holders of our existing common stock will receive shares representing an aggregate of 4% of our common stock following emergence from the bankruptcy, subject to dilution for issuances pursuant to a new management incentive plan. The holders of our preferred stock will receive shares representing an aggregate of 2.5% of our common stock following emergence from the bankruptcy. All of our existing warrants (other than outstanding warrants with an exercise price of $0.01) and options would be cancelled. If certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code are met, a Chapter 11 plan can be confirmed notwithstanding its rejection by our equity security holders and notwithstanding the fact that such equity security holders do not receive or retain any property on account of their equity interests under the Plan. Our capital structure will be significantly altered under any Chapter 11 plan confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, and there can be no assurances regarding the amount of any distribution holders of claims against, or equity interests in, us ultimately will receive with respect to their claims or equity interests. In addition, we cannot predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 proceedings may have on our corporate or capital structure.\nFurthermore, if any Consenting Equity Holder objects to, delays, interferes with the Restructuring or the DIP Facility, holders of our common stock will not receive any new common stock or releases under the Plan.\nOn April 8, 2015, we received a letter from the staff of the NASDAQ Global Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) stating that NASDAQ has determined that our securities will be delisted from NASDAQ. Accordingly, trading of our common stock will be suspended at the opening of business on Friday, April 17, 2015, and NASDAQ will file a Form 25-NSE with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove our securities from listing and registration on the NASDAQ Global Market. We currently do not intend to appeal NASDAQ\u2019s determination. If we do not appeal, we expect that our securities will be immediately eligible to trade over-the-counter. Accordingly, trading in our securities is limited, and holders of such securities may not be able to resell their securities for their purchase price or at all. Accordingly, trading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of such securities. Trading prices for our securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by holders thereof in our Chapter 11 proceedings.\nThere may not be an active trading market for our common stock upon our emergence from Chapter 11, which may affect a stockholder\u2019s ability to sell any shares of common stock received upon emergence from bankruptcy or the price at which such shares can be sold.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11, new shares of our common stock will be issued to our lenders under the Term Loan, holders of our preferred stock, holders of our common stock and certain holders of warrants to purchase shares of our common\nstock. After emergence, we do not anticipate that we will continue to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and we do not intend to seek to list our new common stock on any national securities exchange. Limited access to information regarding the Company and the lack of an exchange listing may limit stockholders\u2019 ability to trade our new common stock. While our new common stock may trade in the over-the-counter market or \u201cpink sheets\u201d on or about the effective date of the Plan, no assurance can be given that a market for the new common stock will develop, or if one develops, that it will provide stockholders with liquidity for their common stock.\nIf the Plan is consummated, we may be controlled by holders of a significant amount of our new common stock.\nUnder the Plan, the lenders under the Term Loan will receive 96% of our new common stock. If these lenders were to act as a group, such lenders might be in a position to control the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors. In addition, a majority of the Consenting Term Lenders will have exclusive control over the selection of four out of the reorganized Company\u2019s five directors, and a majority of the Consenting Term Lenders, along with us, will determine the terms and conditions to be contained in the reorganized Company\u2019s governance documents.\nThe RSA is subject to significant conditions and milestones that may be difficult for us to satisfy.\nThere are certain material conditions we must satisfy under the RSA, including the timely satisfaction of milestones in the Chapter 11 proceedings, such as confirmation of the Plan and effectiveness of the Plan. Our ability to timely complete such milestones is subject to risks and uncertainties that may be beyond our control.\nThe Bankruptcy Court may find the solicitation of acceptances inadequate.\nUsually, votes to accept or reject a plan of reorganization are solicited after the filing of a petition commencing Chapter 11 proceedings. Nevertheless, debtors may solicit votes prior to the commencement of Chapter 11 proceedings, as long as the solicitation complies with applicable nonbankruptcy law, the plan of reorganization is transmitted to substantially all creditors and other interest holders entitled to vote and the time prescribed for voting is not unreasonably short. If the bankruptcy court finds, after notice and a hearing, that the plan was not transmitted in accordance with reasonable procedures, holders of a claim or interest who has accepted or rejected a plan prior to commencement of a case will not be deemed to have accepted or rejected the plan. If there is an objection to our solicitation procedures and the court agrees, we may be required to re-solicit votes to accept or reject the Plan.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur capital structure will be significantly altered under any Chapter 11 plan confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a Chapter 11 plan, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements.\nIf we fail to consummate the Plan, a non-prepackaged proceeding could delay our emergence from bankruptcy.\nIf we are not able to consummate the Plan, we would likely become subject to a \u201ctraditional\u201d bankruptcy proceeding, which would be lengthy, costly and highly disruptive and have a more pronounced adverse effect on our business than the pre-packaged plan contemplated by the RSA. A \u201ctraditional\u201d bankruptcy proceeding would likely involve contested issues with multiple creditors. A non-prepackaged proceeding could also cause critical members of our senior management team to pursue other opportunities.\nThe uncertainty surrounding a prolonged restructuring would also have other adverse effects on us. For example, it would also adversely affect:\n\u2022\nour ability to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nour liquidity;\n\u2022\nhow our business is viewed by investors, lenders and credit ratings agencies; and\n\u2022\nour enterprise value.\nThe DIP Facilities may be insufficient to fund our cash requirements through our emergence from bankruptcy.\nThe Company believes that the DIP Facilities contemplated by the RSA will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements through the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings. However, if the effective date of the Plan does not occur during the term of the DIP Facilities, we may not be able to obtain sufficient additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. For the duration of the Chapter 11 proceedings, we will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to (1) the inability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for operations or to fund any reorganization plan and meet future obligations, and (2) increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 proceedings and our reorganization.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nAs a result of our recent operating performance and need to conserve cash, we implemented a temporary shutdown of our two U.S. manufacturing facilities, which resulted in some customer order losses. We may experience further customer order losses as a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings. If we are unable to reclaim or replace lost sales orders or if we experience further customer order losses, our business may be adversely affected.\nAs part of our efforts to conserve cash and reduce glassware inventory, we temporarily shut down our two U.S. manufacturing facilities, while serving customer demand out of existing inventory and through purchased product. The shutdown commenced on May 15, 2014, and the facilities restarted operations at varying dates to fulfill customer demand. As a result of the shutdown and recent liquidity constraints that impacted our vendor relationship and caused our customers to be uncertain about our future and their relationships with us, which resulted in some customer order losses and missed opportunities for seasonal promotional sales. This uncertainty adversely affected our ability to attract and retain key customers. The shutdown and liquidity challenge also negatively impacted our ability to fulfill customer orders and we continue to face shortages of inventory and delayed shipments as we work to return our inventory and service levels to more normalized levels. If we are unable to restore customer confidence and reclaim or replace lost sales orders, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The Chapter 11 proceedings may make it more difficult for us to restore customer confidence. As a result, we may experience further customer order losses. The uncertainty of product orders can make it difficult to forecast our sales and allocate our resources in a manner consistent with actual sales, and our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future sales. If our expectations regarding future sales are inaccurate, we may be unable to reduce costs in a timely manner to adjust for sales shortfalls, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a purported securities class action lawsuits that could adversely affect our business. This litigation, and potential similar or related litigation, could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nOn October 7, 2014, we were named as a defendant in a series of purported class action lawsuits in complaints filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The complaints allege that we and certain of our current and former executive officers violated Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) by issuing allegedly false or misleading statements concerning us. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages.\nWe intend to vigorously defend these claims. Nonetheless, the lawsuits discussed above may result in costly and protracted litigation, which may require significant commitment of our financial and management resources and time. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and could result in substantial damages. Either favorable or unfavorable outcomes could have a material negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations, due to defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, we may in the future be the target of securities class action lawsuits similar to those described above.\nOur ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers, and key executives is critical to our success.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. We have recently experienced turnover in several senior management positions, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing and Senior Vice President of Operations and Supply Chain. Our\nChapter 11 proceedings may make it more difficult to retain our key officers and employees. The loss of certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Our industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for personnel with successful track records. Our ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to offer competitive wages, benefits, and professional growth opportunities. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nUnexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical processing equipment, such as furnaces, forming machines, stamping presses, spinning machines and lehrs. This equipment may incur downtime as a result of unanticipated failures, accidents, natural disasters or other force majeure events. We may in the future experience facility shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such failures or events. Unexpected interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our productivity and results of operations for the affected period. We also may face shutdowns if we are unable to obtain enough energy during the peak demand periods.\nFluctuations in buying decisions of our customers and changing policies and requests of our customers could harm our business.\nOur consumer segment customers include mass merchants, discount retailers, specialty stores, department stores, grocery stores, and other retailers; our foodservice segment customers include equipment and supply dealers, the hotel and gaming industry, broadline distributors and chain restaurants, airlines, and cruise lines; and our specialty segment customers include candle and floral wholesalers, direct sellers, industrial lighting manufacturers and distillers, and distributors of premium spirits. Unanticipated changes in purchasing and other practices by our customers, including a customer\u2019s pricing and payment terms, could adversely affect our profitability. Our customers have requested, and may continue to request, increased service and other accommodations, including design services, rebates, volume discounts, payment term discounts, and packaging customization. We may face substantially increased expenses to meet these requests, which would reduce our margins. For example, in the consumer segment, retailers may engage in inventory destocking (which may also affect our specialty segment), impose limitations on shelf space, or use private label brands, and these actions may negatively affect the sales or profitability of our products. As a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend among retailers to make purchases on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis. This requires us to shorten our lead time for production in certain cases and more closely anticipate demand, which could in the future require us to carry additional inventories. Our success and growth is also dependent on our evaluation of consumer preferences and changing trends.\nMany of our customers are significantly larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources and also purchase goods directly from vendors in Asia and elsewhere. Decisions by large customers to increase their purchases directly from overseas vendors could have a material adverse effect on us. Significant changes in or financial difficulties of our customers, including consolidations of ownership, restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations, or other events, could result in fewer stores selling our products, fewer distributors and foodservice customers ordering our products, an increase in the risk of extending credit to these customers or limitations on our ability to collect amounts due from these customers. Purchases by our customers are generally made using individual purchase orders. As a result, these customers may cancel their orders, change purchase quantities from forecast volumes, delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond our control, or change other terms of their business relationship with us. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in purchases, or changes in business practices by customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2014, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates (including Sam\u2019s Club and Asda Superstore) accounted for approximately 16% of our revenues. A material reduction in purchases by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. could have a significant adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, pressures by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. that would cause us to materially reduce the price of our products could result in reductions of our operating margin.\nSlowdowns in the retail or foodservice industries could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOur operations and financial performance are directly impacted by changes in the retail and foodservice industries, which in turn are impacted by changes in the economy. The retail and foodservice industries are directly affected by general economic factors including recession, inflation, deflation, new home sales and housing starts, levels of disposable income, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, unemployment trends, fuel and energy costs, material input costs, foreign currency translation, labor cost inflation, interest rates, the impact of natural disasters, political and social unrest and terrorism, and other matters that influence consumer spending.\nAny significant downturn in the economy may significantly lower consumer discretionary spending, which may in turn lower the demand for our products, particularly in our consumer segment. In particular, demand for our consumer products is correlated to the strength of the housing industry because consumers are more likely to purchase tabletop, food preparation, and pantry products in connection with purchasing a new home. When home sales and housing starts are weak, demand for our products can be adversely affected. Expenditures in the foodservice industry are also affected by discretionary spending levels and may decline during a general economic downturn. Hotels, airlines, and restaurants are less likely to invest in new flatware, dinnerware, barware, hollowware, and banquetware when there is a slowdown in their industry.\nCurrently, uncertainty about global economic conditions may cause consumers of our products to postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news, or declines in income or asset values. These factors could have adverse effects on the demand for our products and on our operating results and financial condition. Substantial deterioration in general economic conditions would likely exacerbate these adverse effects and could result in a wide-ranging and prolonged impact on general business conditions, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur operations and financial performance are directly impacted by changes in the economy.\nA general decline in the economy could negatively affect our business and results of operations. The volatility of the current economic climate makes it difficult for us to predict our results of operations. In periods of economic uncertainty, our customers may face financial difficulties, including the unavailability of or reduction in commercial credit, or both, that may result in decreased sales by our company. Certain of our customers may cease operations or seek bankruptcy protection, which would reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our results of operations. Our customers that are financially viable and that do not experience economic distress may nevertheless elect to reduce the volume of orders for our products or close facilities in an effort to remain financially stable or as a result of the unavailability of commercial credit, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe may also have difficulty accessing the global credit markets due to the tightening of commercial credit availability and the financial difficulties of our customers. In addition, we may experience challenges in forecasting revenues and operating results due to these global economic conditions. The difficulty in forecasting revenues and operating results may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nOur business requires us to maintain a large fixed-cost base that can affect our profitability.\nThe high fixed cost levels involved in operating manufacturing plants encourage high levels of output, even during periods of reduced demand, which can lead to excess inventory levels and exacerbate the pressure on profit margins. In addition, significant portions of our selling, administrative, and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionally with sales. Our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to spread fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped, and if we reduce our rate of production, the cost per unit increases, negatively impacting our gross margins. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our results of operations. For example, beginning in May 2014, we shut down production for a period of time at our two U.S. manufacturing facilities to preserve cash and reduce inventory. We restarted two out of three furnaces at our Lancaster facility on July 14, 2014. We had previously shut down the third furnace indefinitely. As a result of the shutdowns of our manufacturing facilities and the furlough of employees, we substantially reduced production, which caused a related increase in cost per unit of inventory produced, because $22.4 million less of our overhead costs were absorbed as a result of lower production levels. Market conditions did not allow us to absorb this increased cost per unit by increasing prices, which resulted in substantially lower gross margins, which declined from 19.3% in 2013 to 12.5% in 2014. This reduction in gross margin negatively affected our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute any material part of our strategy, our ability to return to profitability and to grow our business would be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to profitably expand our business. Our ability to return to profitability and to grow in the future will depend upon a number of factors, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nour ability to consummate the Plan on the time frame contemplated and emerge from bankruptcy;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute on our business strategies during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings;\n\u2022\nrestoring customer confidence;\n\u2022\nreducing our cost structure;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain efficient, timely and cost-effective production and delivery of our products;\n\u2022\nthe level of competition in the consumer products industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to offer new products and to extend existing brands and products into new markets, including international markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to remain competitive in our pricing;\n\u2022\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts in building product and brand awareness and cross-marketing our brands;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and respond successfully to emerging trends in the consumer products industry;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer acceptance of our products; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and consumer confidence.\nWe may not be successful in executing our operational strategies, and even if we do so, we may not be able to sustain profitability.\nOur foodservice segment is sensitive to safety concerns, including acts of terrorism, unstable political conditions, or public health catastrophes, which could adversely affect our customers\u2019 businesses and could reduce demand for our products.\nWithin the foodservice industry, the travel and hospitality businesses are sensitive to safety concerns, and these businesses may decline after acts of terrorism, during periods of political instability in which travelers become concerned about safety issues, or when travel might involve health-related risks. For example, sales to the airline industry greatly decreased in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and the security measures implemented in response to such attacks, including removing metal flatware and knives from aboard commercial flights. Acts of terrorism, unstable political conditions, or a public health catastrophe could negatively affect our customers in the foodservice segment and reduce their purchases from us, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nIf our products do not appeal to a broad range of consumers, our sales and our results of operations would be harmed.\nOur success depends on our products\u2019 appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. If our current products do not meet consumer demands, our sales will decline. In addition, our growth depends upon our ability to develop new products and product improvements, which involve numerous risks. As we grow, our reliance on new products may increase. We may not be able to accurately identify consumer preferences, translate our knowledge into consumer-accepted products, or successfully integrate new products with our existing product platform or operations. We may also experience increased expenses incurred in connection with product development or marketing and advertising that are not subsequently supported by a sufficient level of sales, which would negatively affect our results of operations. Unsuccessful product launches could also result in increased inventory write-downs. We may not be able to successfully develop new products in the future, and our newly developed products may not contribute favorably to our results of operations. Furthermore, product development may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could cause sales of our existing products to suffer.\nWe are subject to certain risks associated with our foreign operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe conduct business outside of the United States in Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability in countries where we operate, which may have an adverse effect on both our operations in those countries and in other parts of the world in which we operate;\n\u2022\nwar, civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\nthe taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation;\n\u2022\ntax rates in certain foreign countries, which may exceed those in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nchanges in government policies, laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ndelays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions;\n\u2022\nineffective intellectual property protection;\n\u2022\nhyperinflation in certain countries;\n\u2022\ndisadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; and\n\u2022\ncomplications in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, which may differ from or conflict with U.S. law.\nOur success will be dependent, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with foreign operations. These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business, financial condition, or results of operations as a whole.\nWe may incur fines or penalties, damage to our reputation or other adverse consequences if our employees, agents or business partners violate, or are alleged to have violated, anti-bribery, competition, or other law.\nOur internal controls may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. or other laws, including world-wide anti-bribery, competition, trade sanctions and regulations, and other related laws. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries, and could damage our reputation. Even the allegation or appearance of our employees, agents, or business partners acting improperly or illegally could damage our reputation and result in significant expenditures in investigating and responding to such actions.\nProduct liability claims or product recalls could adversely affect our results of operations or harm our reputation or the value of our brands.\nThe marketing of our products involves an inherent risk of product liability claims or recalls or other regulatory or enforcement actions initiated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, by other regulatory authorities, or through private causes of action. Any defects in products that we market could harm our credibility, adversely affect our relationship with our customers, and decrease market acceptance of our products and the strength of our brand names. We could also be required to recall potentially defective products, which could result in further adverse publicity and significant expenses. We are subject to product liability litigation in the ordinary course of business, and failures of our products in the future may subject us to additional product liability claims and associated litigation. Potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or could be excluded under the terms of our insurance policy and could materially damage our business and our financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if we are accused of intellectual property infringement, our ability to compete would be negatively impacted.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade dress and trade secret laws, licenses, and confidentiality and other agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. However, this protection may not be sufficient. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged or invalidated, an infringement suit by us against a third party may not be successful and third parties could adopt trademarks similar to ours. In the past, other companies have infringed upon our trademarks, copied our patented and copyrighted products, and otherwise violated our intellectual property. The cost associated with actively protecting our intellectual property is oftentimes very high in relation to the net sales of a particular product is impacted. Furthermore, we operate in jurisdictions that make it difficult to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we have been accused of infringing or violating the intellectual property rights of third parties in the past and may be accused again. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation. Failure to protect our intellectual property or prevail in any intellectual property litigation could materially and adversely affect our competitive position or otherwise harm our business.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nWe have customers in Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, which accounted for approximately 2% of our revenues in 2014. Gross sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 4% of our revenues in 2014. We have operations in Canada, China, and Mexico which accounted for approximately 6% of our operating expenses in 2014. As a result, we generate a portion of our revenue and incur a portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of our non-U.S. subsidiaries affect our results as reported in U.S. dollars.\nMajor fluctuations in the value of the pound sterling, euro, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar could also reduce the cost competitiveness of our products as compared to foreign competition. For example, if the U.S. dollar appreciates against the pound sterling, euro, Canadian dollar, and Mexican peso, the purchasing power of those currencies effectively would be reduced compared to the U.S. dollar, making our U.S.-manufactured products more expensive in Europe, Canada and Mexico, respectively, compared to the products of local competitors, and making products manufactured by our foreign competitors in those locations more cost-competitive with our U.S. manufactured products. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling, euro, Canadian dollar, and Mexican peso also would increase the cost of U.S. dollar-denominated purchases for our operations in Canada and Mexico, including raw materials. We would be forced to deduct these cost increases from our results of operations or attempt to pass them along to consumers. These fluctuations could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition and competitive pressures, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is highly competitive. We compete with many other suppliers, some of which are larger than we are, have greater financial and other resources, employ brands that are more established, have greater consumer recognition or are more favorably perceived by consumers or retailers than our brands. Some of our competitors have invested and continue to invest heavily to achieve increased production efficiencies. Competitors may have incorporated more advanced technology in their manufacturing processes, including more advanced automation techniques. Our labor and energy costs also may be higher than those of some foreign producers of glass tableware. We may not be successful in managing our labor and energy costs, increasing output at our manufacturing facilities, or gaining operating efficiencies that may be necessary to remain competitive. In addition, our products may be subject to competition from low-cost imports that intensify the price competition faced in various markets. Some of our competitors are privately owned and have more latitude to operate than we do as a public company. If we do not successfully compete with these competitors on factors such as new product development, innovation, brand, delivery, customer service, price, and quality, our customers may consider changing manufacturers. Competitive pressures from our competitors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe source some of our products from third-party suppliers located in Asia, Europe and Mexico, which reduces our control over the manufacturing process and may cause variations in quality or delays in our ability to fill orders.\nWe source all of our metal flatware and crystal stemware and much of our dinnerware from third party suppliers located in Asia, Europe and Mexico. We depend on these suppliers to deliver products that are free from defects, comply with our specifications, meet health, safety and delivery requirements, and are competitive in cost. If our suppliers deliver products that are defective or that otherwise do not meet our specifications, our return rates may increase, and the reputation of our products and brands may suffer. In addition, if our suppliers do not meet our delivery requirements or cease doing business with us for any reason, we might miss our customers\u2019 delivery deadlines, which could in turn cause our customers to cancel or reduce orders, refuse to accept deliveries, or demand reduced prices. The overseas sourcing of product subjects us to the numerous risks of doing business abroad, including but not limited to, rapid changes in economic or political conditions, civil unrest, political instability, war, terrorist attacks, international health epidemics, work stoppages or labor disputes, currency fluctuations, increasing export duties, trade sanctions and tariffs, and variations in product quality. We may also experience temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather or transportation delays. Even if acceptable alternative suppliers are found, the process of locating and securing such alternatives is likely to disrupt our business, and we may not be able to secure alternative suppliers on acceptable terms that provide the same quality product or comply with all applicable laws. Any of these events would cause our business, results of operations, and financial condition to suffer.\nIf we or our suppliers are unable to obtain raw materials at favorable prices, it could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nSand, limestone and soda ash are the principal materials we use in the manufacture of our glassware and crystal products. Resins, clay, flint, aluminum oxide, glass frit and colorants are the principal materials we use in the manufacture of our dinnerware products. Stainless steel, nickel, brass, silver and gold are the principal materials our suppliers use in the manufacture of our flatware and hollowware products. All of these raw materials are purchased in highly competitive, price-sensitive markets, which have historically exhibited price, demand and supply cyclicality. From time to time, some of these raw materials have been in short supply due to weather or other factors, including disruptions in supply caused by raw material transportation or production delays. We may experience shortages of raw materials in the future. If we experience temporary shortages in raw materials, we or our suppliers may be forced to procure materials from alternative suppliers, and they may not be able to do so on terms as favorable as their current terms or at all. If we or our suppliers are unable to purchase certain raw materials required for operations for a significant period of time, our or their operations would be disrupted, and our results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, material increases in the cost of any of these raw materials on an industry-wide basis would have an adverse effect on our results of operations if we were unable to pass on these increased costs to our customers in a timely manner or at all.\nNatural gas, the principal fuel we use to manufacture our glass products, is subject to fluctuating prices that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nNatural gas is the primary source of energy in most of our glass production processes, and variability in the price for natural gas has had and will continue to have an impact on our profitability. We do not have long-term contracts for natural gas and, as a result, our operating results are strongly linked to the cost of natural gas. We have, from time to time, entered into short-term contracts to hedge certain of our energy costs, including natural gas. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we spent approximately $9.8 million and $13.2 million, respectively, on natural gas. Natural gas prices may rise in the future. To the extent that we are not able to offset increases in natural gas prices, such as by passing along the cost to our customers, these increases could adversely impact our margins and results of operations. In addition, potential legislation, regulatory action, and international treaties related to climate change, especially those related to the regulation of greenhouse gases, may result in significant increases in raw material and energy costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup any past or future increases in the cost of energy and raw materials.\nTransportation disruptions and increased transportation costs could adversely affect our business.\nWe import certain of our products for delivery to our distribution centers, as well as arrange for our customers to import goods to which title has passed overseas or at port of entry. Accordingly, we are subject to risks incidental to such transportation. These risks include, but are not limited to, increases in fuel costs, the availability of ships, increased security restrictions, work stoppages, and carriers\u2019 ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs. We deliver our products to our customers from our distribution centers or make such products available for customer pickup from our distribution centers. Prolonged domestic transportation disruptions, as well as workforce or systems issues related to our distribution centers, could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver goods to our customers.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.\nWe are potentially subject to work stoppages and other labor disputes because a significant number of production and maintenance employees at our manufacturing facilities are represented by labor unions. These facilities have experienced work stoppages and strikes in the past, and there potentially could be work stoppages and strikes in the future. Any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal manufacturing facilities could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are party to collective bargaining agreements that cover most of our manufacturing employees. Our intent is to negotiate and enter into new collective bargaining agreements with labor unions representing employees at each facility upon expiration of the existing agreements; however, we may be unable to do so without lock-outs, strikes, or work stoppages. In addition, in connection with our plant closures, we sought to renegotiate our union contracts in order to reduce operating expenses that we believe were required in order to return to profitability. We could also experience operating inefficiencies as a result of preparations for disruptions in production, such as increasing production and inventories. Any such disruptions or difficulties could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we could experience increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members upon the execution of new agreements with our labor unions. We may be unable to manage our growth effectively, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on increasingly complex information systems for management of our manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting and other functions. If our information systems fail to perform these functions adequately, or if we experience an interruption in our operations, our business and results of operations could suffer.\nAll of our major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon complex information systems. Our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from: earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; power loss, computer systems failure, internet and telecommunications or data network failure; and hackers, computer viruses, software bugs or glitches. Any damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of our information systems to perform as expected could disrupt our business or result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages. We have taken significant steps to mitigate the potential impact of each of these risks, but these procedures may not be completely successful.\nOur products are subject to various health and safety requirements and may be subject to new health and safety requirements in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur products are subject to certain legal requirements relating to health and safety. These legal requirements frequently change and vary among jurisdictions. Compliance with these requirements, or the failure to comply with these requirements, may have a material adverse effect on our operations. If any of our products become subject to new regulations, or become specifically regulated by additional governmental or other regulatory entities, the cost of compliance could be material. For example, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (the \u201cCPSC\u201d) regulates many consumer products, including our products sold to our consumer customers. New regulations or policies by the CPSC could require us to change our manufacturing processes, which could materially raise our manufacturing costs. In addition, new regulations could reduce sales of our consumer products. Furthermore, a significant order or judgment against us by governmental or regulatory authority relating to health or safety matters, or the imposition of a significant fine relating to such matters, or a voluntary or mandatory recall of regulated products may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulation related to environmental and health and safety matters could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must comply with extensive laws, rules and regulations in the United States and in each of the countries in which we engage in business regarding environmental matters, such as air, soil, and water quality, waste disposal, and climate change. We must also comply with extensive laws, rules, and regulations regarding safety, health, and corporate responsibility matters. These legal requirements frequently change and vary among jurisdictions. These laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, as well as personal injury and property damage claims. Compliance with these requirements, or the failure to comply with these requirements, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d). We have incurred fines and penalties from time to time as a result of failures to comply with OSHA standards, none of which have\nbeen material individually or in aggregate, to date. As a result, we will be subject to more frequent OSHA inspections in the future. Potential additional fines and penalties incurred in connection with future inspections could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe have incurred, and expect to incur, costs to comply with environmental legal requirements, including requirements limiting greenhouse gas emissions, and these costs could increase in the future. For example the U.S. EPA issued a finding in 2009 that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. The endangerment finding and EPA\u2019s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act, may lead to regulation of stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The failure to comply materially with existing and new laws, rules, and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Many environmental legal requirements provide for substantial fines, orders, and criminal sanctions for violations. In addition, certain environmental laws impose strict liability and, under certain circumstances, joint and several liabilities on current and prior owners and operators of these sites, as well as persons who sent waste to them, for costs to investigate and remediate contaminated sites. These legal requirements may apply to conditions at properties that we presently or formerly owned or operated, as well as at other properties, for which we may be responsible, including those at which wastes attributable to us were disposed. Historically, we have incurred costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, including at a former ceramics facility in Buffalo, New York, and a silverware manufacturing plant in Sherrill, New York. A significant order or judgment against us, the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the internet and e-commerce and may be subject to future laws and regulations governing the Internet and e-commerce, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the internet and e-commerce. These existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services, broadband residential internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, and personal privacy apply to the internet and e-commerce. Unfavorable resolutions of these issues would harm our business. This could, in turn, diminish the demand for our products on the internet and increase our cost of doing business.\nA substantial portion of our operating income is derived from license fees. Any significant or material reduction of these fees or any failure by licensees to adequately promote our brands could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have entered into license agreements under which we license the ONEIDA\u00ae trademark for use by third parties on their products, and a substantial portion of our operating income is derived from license fees under these agreements. License fees from these third parties represented $6.4 million or 1.8% of our consolidated revenues and 14.5% of our consolidated gross margin for 2014. We have granted Robinson Home Products, Inc., our largest licensee by revenues, the exclusive right to market ONEIDA\u00ae branded flatware, dinnerware, glassware, kitchen tools and accessories and table linens in the consumer sales channels (excluding e-commerce) in the U.S. In 2014, we recognized $6.1 million in license fees from Robinson Home Products, which represented 1.7% of our consolidated revenues and 13.8% of our consolidated gross margin for 2014. If we were to lose our license fees from Robinson Home Products due to a change in our relationship with them or in their business, we would seek to terminate our agreement with them and either market the ONEIDA\u00ae branded products directly in our Consumer segment or enter into an alternative arrangement with a new licensee, either of which would result in a disruption in royalty payments the significance and duration of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating income and results of operations for the period in which this disruption occurs. Furthermore, if Robinson Home Products fails to adequately promote the ONEIDA\u00ae branded products or otherwise fails to maximize the value of the ONEIDA\u00ae brand in the market, it could be costly and difficult for us to enforce or terminate the licensing agreement with them, and it could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and results of operation.\nOur pension plans are underfunded and, in the future, the underfunding levels of our pension plans and our pension expense could materially increase.\nMany of our employees participate in, and many of our former employees are entitled to benefits under, funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement welfare plans. All of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans are frozen. Over\ntime, we have experienced periods of declines in interest rates and pension asset values. As a result, our pension plans and our other-postretirement benefit plans are underfunded. Further declines in interest rates or the market value of the securities held by the plans, or certain other changes, could materially increase the underfunded status of our plans in 2015 and beyond and affect the level and timing of required contributions in 2016 and beyond. The current underfunded status of our pension plans will, and a further material increase in the underfunded status of the plans would, significantly increase our required contributions and pension expense, and could impair our ability to achieve or sustain future profitability and could adversely affect our financial condition. The unfunded amount of the projected benefit obligation for our global defined benefit pension plans was $20.8 million and 13.0 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The unfunded amount of the projected benefit obligation for our global post-retirement welfare plans was $0.8 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to the global funded defined benefit pension plans of approximately $0.9 million in 2015.\nCharges related to employee pension and other-postretirement benefit plans resulting from market risk and headcount realignment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with our employee pension and other-postretirement benefit plans, we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets. Changes in long-term interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure our obligations and related expense. To the extent that we experience headcount changes, we may incur further expenses related to our employee pension and other-postretirement benefit plans that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 proceedings, net operating losses and other tax attributes are not expected to be available upon emergence from the Chapter 11 proceedings.\nCertain tax attributes, such as net operating loss carry-forwards and certain tax credits, are expected to be utilized in connection with the Chapter 11 proceedings. Under Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code, tax attributes are reduced to the extent discharge of indebtedness income is excluded from gross income arising from a Chapter 11 case. If any attributes are still available after the application of Section 108, such attributes will be limited or lost due to the Company\u2019s experiencing an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of the foregoing rules, any pre-emergence net operating losses and certain tax credits are not expected to be available to the Company and its subsidiaries to reduce taxable income for tax periods beginning after emergence from Chapter 11.\nIf our goodwill, other intangible assets and indefinite-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record significant charges to earnings.\nWe review our definite-lived intangible assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates in our markets, reduced expected future cash flows and a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We consider available current information when calculating our impairment charge. If there are indicators of impairment, our long-term cash flow forecasts for our operations deteriorate or discount rates increase, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in later periods. In light of our higher than expected losses in the previous and current quarter and expected losses going forward, we recognized an impairment of $0.1 million relating to our international goodwill and $3.1 million relating to our tradename and tradename licenses in the three months ended June 30, 2014.", "PERMNO": 13378, "SIC": 3910, "TIC": "EVRYQ"}
