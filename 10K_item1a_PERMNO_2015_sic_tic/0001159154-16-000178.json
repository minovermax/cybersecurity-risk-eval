{"cik": "1159154", "company": "REPUBLIC AIRWAYS HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors, in addition to the information discussed elsewhere herein, should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business:\nRisks Related To Our Operations\nOur filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and our ability to successfully emerge as a stronger, more focused company may be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties.\nWe are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, which may lead to potential adverse effects on our liquidity, results of operations and business prospects. We cannot make any assurances regarding the outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings. Risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings include the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions in the Chapter 11 cases and the outcomes of Bankruptcy Court rulings in the case in general;\n\u2022\nthe length of time that we will operate under the Chapter 11 cases and our ability to successfully emerge from Chapter 11;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court and creditor approval of our plan of reorganization and the impact of alternative proposals, views and objections of the creditors\u2019 committee and other interested parties, which may make it difficult to develop and consummate a plan of reorganization in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with third parties seeking and obtaining court approval to (i) terminate or shorten our exclusivity period to propose and confirm a plan of reorganization; (ii) appoint a Chapter 11 trustee or (iii) convert the Chapter 11 cases to Chapter 7 liquidation cases;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with third-party motions in the Chapter 11 cases, which may interfere with our reorganization efforts;\n\u2022\nthe ability to maintain sufficient liquidity throughout the Chapter 11 proceedings;\n\u2022\nincreased costs related to the Bankruptcy Filing;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage contracts that are critical to our operation, to obtain and maintain appropriate terms with customers, suppliers and service providers; and\n\u2022\nthe outcome of pre-petition claims against us; and our ability to maintain existing customers, vendor relationships and expand our customer base.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, as well as with vendors and employees, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition, particularly if the Chapter 11 proceedings are protracted. Also, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities.\nBecause of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 cases, the ultimate impact of events that occur during the reorganization proceedings on our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified. If any one or more of these risks materializes, it could affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have substantial liquidity needs and face liquidity pressure.\nWe have substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business and face significant liquidity challenges due to the financial difficulties experienced in the airline industry. Accordingly, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will remain under pressure during 2016 and thereafter. Because substantially all of our assets are encumbered, we believe we will not be able to obtain any material amount of additional debt financing during our Chapter 11 proceedings.\nA number of other factors, including our financial results in the recent year, our substantial indebtedness, the difficult revenue environment we face, and the financial difficulties experienced in the airline industry, adversely affect the availability and terms of funding that might be available to us during, and upon emergence from, our Chapter 11 cases. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurances that we will be able to source capital at acceptable rates and on acceptable terms, if at all, to fund our current operations and our exit from Chapter 11. An inability to obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on us and on our ability to sustain our operations, both currently and upon emergence from Chapter 11.\nOur initiatives to reduce our idled aircraft costs and increase revenues may not be adequate or successful.\nAs we seek to improve our financial condition, we must continue to take steps to reduce our idled aircraft costs during the Chapter 11 proceedings. As of December 31, 2015, we have 41 50-seat regional jets under fixed-fee code-share agreements which are scheduled to expire May 2016. In most cases, the term of the aircraft lease or debt agreement exceeds the term of the aircraft under its respective code-share agreement. To the extent that aircraft are removed from service, we must either sell or sublease the aircraft to another party in order to cover our carrying expenses for that aircraft. Our inability to sell or sublease aircraft that are removed from fixed-fee service could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nOur future plan of reorganization will contain initiatives to increase our revenues. We should, however, note that given the structure and long-term nature of our code-share agreements and our relationships with our partners, it is very difficult to identify and implement significant cost savings initiatives. Moreover, whether our initiatives will be adequate or successful depends in large measure on factors beyond our control, notably the overall competitive environment, including passenger demand, yield and industry capacity growth. We also can provide no assurance that during the reorganization process we will not be required to provide consideration or other inducements or accept unfavorable contractual provisions into some of our CPAs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or the price of our common stock.\nWe may experience difficulty finding, training and retaining qualified pilots and maintenance technicians.\nThe regional airline industry is experiencing a shortage of qualified personnel, specifically pilots and maintenance technicians. In addition, as is common within the regional airline industry, we have, from time to time, faced considerable turnover of our employees. Our pilots, flight attendants and maintenance technicians sometimes leave to work for mainline airlines, which generally offer higher salaries and more extensive benefit programs than regional airlines are financially able to offer. Should the turnover of employees, particularly pilots and maintenance technicians, sharply increase, we may not be able to hire sufficient pilots and maintenance technicians to replace those leaving, and in any event our training costs would likely significantly increase.\nOn August 1, 2013, the congressionally-mandated pilot experience qualifications contained in the Airline Safety and FAA Extension Act of 2010 became effective. As a result of this legislation, the age and training requirements for the Company\u2019s first\nofficer pilots generally increased to 23 years and 1,500 hours of flight time. Military pilots are subject to somewhat lower standards, but as the wind-down of the U.S. involvement in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan has substantially concluded, there are fewer military-trained pilots entering the workforce. In addition, the FAA has implemented a new regulation that increases the flight crew duty, flight, and rest requirements for pilots. This update changed the length of time a pilot may be on duty and how much she or he may fly in a day, month, and year. These new limitations, together with the new, more restrictive certification and qualification requirements, have resulted in a growing scarcity of qualified new entrants and have contributed to the current severe nationwide pilot shortage.\nNegative events or publicity associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with our employees and lead to higher turnover. In addition, such negative events or publicity could adversely affect our ability to attract qualified pilots and maintenance technicians. This could continue to have adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition if we are not able to fulfill our contractual obligations under our capacity purchase agreements with our Partners.\nIncreases in our labor costs, which constitute a substantial portion of our total operating costs, will directly impact our earnings and our ability to compete for new fixed-fee business.\nLabor costs constitute a significant percentage of our total operating costs, and we have experienced pressure to increase wages and benefits for our employees. Under our code-share agreements, our reimbursement rates contemplate labor costs that increase on a set schedule generally tied to an increase in the consumer price index or the actual increase in the contract. We are entirely responsible for our labor costs, and we may not be entitled to receive increased payments for our flights from our Partners if our labor costs increase above the assumed costs included in the reimbursement rates. As a result, a significant increase in our labor costs above the levels assumed in our reimbursement rates could result in a material reduction in our earnings.\nOn October 27, 2015, the IBT Local 357 voted by a margin of 76% to ratify a new three-year Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), with approximately 90% of the eligible pilots voting. The three-year agreement became effective on its date of signing, October 29, 2015. The ratification of the CBA provides no assurance that the Company's operation and financial performance will be fully restored.\nThe CBA ratified by the Pilots on October 27, 2015 increased pilot labor costs approximately $50.0 million per year on average over the three-year duration of the agreement, including both the ratification bonus and the anniversary bonus. The ratification bonus of approximately $17.0 million was paid during the fourth quarter of 2015; and the anniversary bonus, currently estimated at approximately $14.0 million is expected to be paid during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWe have collective bargaining agreements with our pilots, flight attendants, and dispatchers. We cannot assure that future agreements with our employees' unions will be on terms in line with our expectations or comparable to agreements entered into by our competitors, and any future agreements may increase our labor costs and reduce both our income and our competitiveness for future business opportunities.\nOur fixed-fee business is dependent on our code-share relationships with our Partners.\nWe depend on relationships created by our regional jet fixed-fee code-share agreements with Delta, United and American for all of our fixed-fee service revenues. Any material modification to, or termination of, our code-share agreements with any of these Partners could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of our operations and the price of our common stock. Each of the code-share agreements contains a number of grounds for termination by our Partners, including our failure to meet specified performance levels.\nIn addition, because substantially all of our fixed-fee service revenues are currently generated under the fixed-fee code-share agreements, if any one of them is terminated, we cannot assure you that we would be able to enter into substitute code-share arrangements, or that any such substitute arrangements would be as favorable to us as the current code-share agreements.\nThe amounts we receive under our code-share agreements may be less than the corresponding costs we incur.\nUnder our code-share agreements, we are compensated for certain costs we incur in providing services. With respect to costs that are defined as pass through costs, our code-share partner is obligated to pay to us the actual amount of the cost. With respect to other costs, our code-share partner is obligated to pay to us amounts based, in part, on pre-determined rates for certain costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 16% of our costs were pass through costs and approximately 84% of our costs were reimbursable at pre-determined rates. These pre-determined rates are not based on the actual expenses we incur, and generally escalate based on a consumer price index, subject to a maximum cap. If our annual rate increases are less\nthan our actual cost escalations or if we incur expenses that are greater than the pre-determined amounts payable by our code-share partners, our financial results will be negatively affected.\nA majority of the Company's limited life parts are not under power by the hour agreements. Once the maintenance event occurs for the limited life part, the Company records the expense for the event under the direct expense method. However, these maintenance events are not a pass through cost under all of our fixed-fee arrangements. Therefore, we could experience a significant amount of volatility in our results of operations and cash flow depending on the amount and timing of when these non-pass through maintenance events occur.\nAny labor disruption or labor strikes by our employees or those of our Partners would adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nAll of our pilots, flight attendants, and dispatchers are represented by unions. Collectively, these employees represent approximately 69% of our workforce. Although we have never had a work interruption or stoppage, we are subject to risks of work interruption or stoppage and/or may incur additional administrative expenses associated with union representation of our employees.\nChanges to our business model may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties.\nWe are devoting significant attention and resources to restructuring our current business. If we are unable to simplify our current business operations in a manner that allows us to maintain cost synergies, or if achievement of such simplification takes longer or costs more than expected, this could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, it is possible that the simplification process could result in the loss of key employees, diversion of management's attention, the disruption or interruption of, or the loss of momentum in our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees.\nReduced utilization levels of our aircraft under the fixed-fee agreements would adversely impact our revenues, earnings and liquidity.\nOur agreements with our Partners require each of them to schedule our aircraft to a minimum level of utilization. However, the aircraft have historically been utilized more than the minimum requirement. Even though the fixed-fee rates may adjust, either up or down, based on scheduled utilization levels or require a fixed amount per day to compensate us for our fixed costs, if our aircraft are at or below the minimum requirement (including taking into account the stage length and frequency of our scheduled flights) we will likely lose both the opportunity to recover a margin on the variable costs of flights that would have been flown if our aircraft were more fully utilized and the opportunity to earn incentive compensation on such flights.\nOur maintenance expenses will increase as our fleet ages and may be higher than we anticipate.\nThe average age of our primary fleet of E170/175 aircraft is approximately 6.4 years old. Our aircraft require less maintenance now than they will in the future. We have incurred lower maintenance expenses because most of the parts on our aircraft are under multi-year warranties. Our maintenance costs will increase as these warranties expire and our fleet ages. For example, our recent engine expenses for our E170/175 aircraft do not reflect the full mature cost of maintaining the aircraft as they do not include any expenses for LLPs. As the Company incurs expense to replace these LLPs, only a portion of our expense may be passed through to our partners, thus our future results of operations and liquidity will be materially impacted.\nWe bear the cost of all routine and major maintenance on our owned and leased aircraft. Maintenance expenses comprise a significant portion of our operating expenses. In addition, we are required periodically to take aircraft out of service for heavy maintenance checks, which can increase costs and reduce revenue. We also may be required to comply with regulations and airworthiness directives the FAA issues, the cost of which our aircraft lessors may only partially assume depending upon the magnitude of the expense. Although we believe that our owned and leased aircraft are currently in compliance with all FAA issued airworthiness directives, additional airworthiness directives likely will be required in the future, necessitating additional expense.\nIf the financial strength of any of our Partners decreases, our financial strength is at risk.\nWe are directly affected by the financial and operating strength of the Partners. In the event of a decrease in the financial or operational strength of any of our Partners, such Partner may be unable to make the payments due to us under its code-share agreement. In addition, it may reduce utilization of our aircraft to the minimum levels specified in the code-share agreements, and it is possible that any code-share agreement with a code-share Partner that files for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code may not be assumed in bankruptcy and could be modified or terminated. Any such event could have an\nadverse effect on our operations and the price of our common stock. As of January 22, 2016, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s, respectively, maintained ratings of BB- and Ba3 for American Airlines Group Inc., BB+ and Ba2 for Delta Air Lines, Inc., and BB- and Ba3 for United Continental Holdings, Inc., the parent of United.\nOur Partners may choose to operate regional aircraft under a wholly owned subsidiary, thus limiting the expansion of our relationships with them.\nWe depend on major airlines, such as our Partners, to contract with us instead of purchasing and operating their own aircraft; however, some major airlines own their own regional airlines and operate their own aircraft instead of entering into contracts with us or other independent regional carriers. For example, Delta and American have acquired many aircraft which they fly under their affiliated carriers. We have no guarantee that in the future our Partners will choose to enter into contracts with us instead of purchasing their own aircraft or entering into relationships with competing regional airlines, as they are not prohibited from doing so under our code-share agreements. A decision by American, Delta or United to phase out our contract-based code-share relationships as they expire and instead acquire and operate their own aircraft or to enter into similar agreements with one or more of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nOur Partners may be restricted in increasing the level of business that they conduct with us, thereby limiting our growth.\nIn general, the pilots' unions of certain major airlines have negotiated \u201cscope clauses\u201d in their collective bargaining agreements, known as CBAs, that restrict the number and/or size of aircraft that can be operated by the regional code-share partners of such major airlines. These CBAs limit regional airlines to flying aircraft with a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 86,000 pounds and a maximum passenger configuration of 76 seats with certain exceptions expressly provided in certain CBAs.\nOur substantial aircraft indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nWe have substantial aircraft indebtedness, which could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligations under our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional money for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes, if needed, and increase the cost of any of these borrowings; and/or\n\u2022\nreduce our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nWe have historically needed substantial liquidity to fund the growth of our fixed-fee business.\nWe currently depend on Embraer and other original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") to support our fleet of aircraft.\nWe rely on Embraer as the primary manufacturer of all of our regional jets and other OEMs who supply critical aircraft parts. Our risks in relying primarily on a single manufacturer for each aircraft type include:\n\u2022\nthe failure or inability of Embraer or an OEM to provide sufficient parts or related support services on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe interruption of fleet service as a result of unscheduled or unanticipated maintenance requirements for these aircraft;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of FAA directives restricting or prohibiting the use of Embraer aircraft or requiring time-consuming inspections and maintenance; and\n\u2022\nthe adverse public perception of a manufacturer as a result of an accident or other adverse publicity.\nOur operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure or inability of Embraer or an OEM to provide sufficient parts or related support services on a timely basis or by an interruption of fleet service as a result of unscheduled or unanticipated maintenance requirements for our aircraft.\nOur business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel.\nOur business depends upon the efforts of our Chief Executive Officer, Bryan Bedford, and our other key management and operating personnel. We may have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and, therefore, the loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business. We maintain a \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance policy in the amount of $5 million for Mr. Bedford, but this amount may not adequately compensate us in the event we lose his services.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards may be limited.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had estimated federal net operating loss carry-forwards, which we refer to as NOLs, of $1.4 billion for federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in 2016. We have recorded a valuation allowance for $398.4 million of those NOLs. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, imposes limitations on a corporation's ability to utilize NOLs if it experiences an \u201cownership change.\u201d In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. In the event of an ownership change, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. Any unused NOLs in excess of the annual limitation may be carried over to later years. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has experienced a 31.0% change in ownership.\nThe imposition of a limitation on our ability to use our NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitation were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Based on analysis that we performed, we believe we have not experienced a change in ownership as defined by Section 382; however; certain of our NOLs generated prior to July 2005 and acquired from previous business acquisitions are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382.\nWe are at risk of losses stemming from an accident involving any of our aircraft.\nWhile we have never had a crash causing death or serious injury in over 41 years of operations, it is possible that one or more of our aircraft may crash or be involved in an accident in the future, causing death or serious injury to individual air travelers and our employees and destroying the aircraft and the property of third parties.\nIn addition, if one of our aircraft were to crash or be involved in an accident, we would be exposed to significant tort liability. Such liability could include liability arising from the claims of passengers or their estates seeking to recover damages for death or injury. There can be no assurance that the insurance we carry to cover such damages will be adequate. Accidents could also result in unforeseen mechanical and maintenance costs. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe, which could result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and a decrease in revenues. Such a decrease could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations\nand the price of our common stock.\nWe are increasingly dependent on technology, and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and compete in the current business environment. The performance and reliability of our technology are critical to our ability to compete effectively. Technology initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in order to deliver these expected benefits. If we are unable to make these investments or the expected benefit does not materialize, our business and operations could be negatively affected.\nIn addition, any internal technological error or failure or large scale external interruption in the technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt our internal network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. Like most companies, our technology systems and related data may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. While we have in place, and continue to invest in, technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and mitigate the resulting adverse financial consequences.\nRisks Associated with the Airline Industry\nIf passengers perceive the operations of regional aircraft as being unsafe, our business may be harmed.\nIn February 2009, Colgan Flight 3407, operating as Continental Connection, crashed on its approach into Buffalo, New York. A total of 50 people were killed. Since the date of this tragedy, there have been numerous press reports questioning some of the operating policies of regional airlines. In response, there have also been legislative initiatives aimed at heightening safety requirements, such as The Airline Safety and Pilot Training Improvement Act of 2009. Although our regional jets have never had a crash causing death or serious injury in over 41 years of operations, should the public perceive regional aircraft as less safe making our Partners less inclined to renew our contracts in the future, or should new legislation impose additional burdens on us, our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nThe airline industry has been subject to a number of strikes, which could affect our business.\nThe airline industry has been negatively impacted by a number of labor strikes. Any new collective bargaining agreement entered into by other carriers may result in higher industry wages and increase pressure on us to increase the wages and benefits of our employees. Furthermore, since each of our Partners is a significant source of our operating revenues, any labor disruption or labor strike by the employees of any one of our Partners could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nAirlines are often affected by certain factors beyond their control, including economic conditions and weather events, which can affect their operations.\nGenerally, revenues for airlines depend on the number of passengers carried, the fare paid by each passenger and service factors, such as the timeliness of departure and arrival. Demand for air travel could weaken in an economic recession. Economic weakness in the United States and international economies could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. During periods of fog, ice, low temperatures, storms or other adverse weather conditions, flights may be canceled or significantly delayed. For example, in the first three months of 2015, the Company canceled approximately 3% of its scheduled flights due to extreme weather, which had a negative impact to pre-tax earnings of roughly $7.0 million for the first quarter. Under our fixed-fee code-share agreements, our regional airline business is partially protected against cancellations due to weather or air traffic control, although these factors may affect our ability to receive incentive payments for flying more than the minimum number of flights specified in our code-share agreements.\nThe airline industry is heavily regulated.\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements, both domestically and internationally, that involve significant costs. In the last several years, the FAA has issued a number of directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that have required us to make significant expenditures. FAA requirements cover, among other things, retirement of older aircraft, security measures, collision avoidance systems, airborne wind shear avoidance systems, noise abatement, commuter aircraft safety and increased inspection and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft.\nWe incur substantial costs in maintaining our current certifications and otherwise complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject. We cannot predict whether we will be able to comply with all present and future laws, rules, regulations and certification requirements or that the cost of continued compliance will not significantly increase our costs of doing business.\nThe FAA has the authority to issue mandatory orders relating to, among other things, pilot rest rules, the grounding of aircraft, inspection of aircraft, installation of new safety-related items and removal, replacement or modification of aircraft parts that have failed or may fail in the future. A decision by the FAA to ground, or require time consuming inspections of or maintenance on, all or any of our Embraer or Bombardier aircraft, for any reason, could negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn addition to state and federal regulation, airports and municipalities enact rules and regulations that affect our operations. From time to time, various airports throughout the country have considered limiting the use of smaller aircraft, such as Embraer or Bombardier aircraft, at such airports. The imposition of any limits on the use of Embraer or Bombardier aircraft at any airport at which we operate could interfere with our obligations under our code-share agreements and severely interrupt our business operations.\nAdditional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. For instance, \u201cpassenger bill of rights\u201d legislation was introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would have, among other things, required the payment of compensation to passengers as a result of certain delays and limited the ability of carriers to prohibit or restrict usage of certain tickets. This legislation is not currently active, but if it is reintroduced, these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices, reducing revenue and increasing costs. Several state legislatures have also considered such legislation, and the State of New York in fact implemented a \u201cpassenger bill of rights\u201d that was overturned by a federal appeals court in 2008. The DOT has imposed restrictions on the ownership and transfer of airline routes and takeoff and landing slots at certain high-density airports, including New York LaGuardia and Reagan National. In addition, as a result of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. in September 2001, the FAA and the TSA have imposed stringent security requirements on airlines. We cannot predict what other new regulations may be imposed on airlines and we cannot assure you that laws or regulations enacted in the future will not materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive.\nWithin the airline industry, we not only compete with other regional airlines, some of which are owned by or operated as partners of major airlines, but we also face competition from low-fare airlines and major airlines on many of our routes, including carriers that fly point to point instead of to or through a hub.\nIn addition, some of our competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. Moreover, federal deregulation of the industry allows competitors to rapidly enter our markets and to quickly discount and restructure fares. The airline industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats.\nIn addition to traditional competition among airlines, the industry faces competition from video teleconferencing and other methods of electronic communication. New advances in technology may add a new dimension of competition to the industry as business travelers seek lower-cost substitutes for air travel.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile.\nSince our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ National Market (now the NASDAQ Global Select Market) on May 27, 2004, the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $1.61 to a high of $23.88 per share. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our Partners, competitors, the airline industry or the economy in general;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us, our Partners or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nthe results of our operations;\n\u2022\nmedia reports and publications about the safety of our aircraft or the aircraft types we operate;\n\u2022\nnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry specific economic conditions, including the price of oil;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock or other actions by investors with significant shareholdings; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, stockholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our stockholders or insiders could depress the price of our common stock.\nSales of a large number of shares of our common stock or the availability of a large number of shares for sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Sales of shares by insiders could be perceived negatively by the investment community.\nOur incorporation documents and Delaware law have provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could negatively affect your investment.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that stockholders may consider favorable. Certain of these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior stockholder approval, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimit the persons who can call special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprovide that a supermajority vote of our stockholders is required to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements to nominate directors for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese and other provisions in our incorporation documents and Delaware law could allow our board of directors to affect your rights as a stockholder by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace board members. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace the current management team. In addition, these provisions could deprive our stockholders of opportunities to realize a premium on the shares of common stock owned by them.\nOur charter documents include provisions limiting voting by foreign owners.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that shares of capital stock may not be voted by or at the direction of persons who are not citizens of the United States if the number of such shares would exceed applicable foreign ownership restrictions. U.S. law currently requires that no more than 25% of the voting stock of our company or any other domestic airline may be owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not citizens of the United States. However, up to 49% of the total equity of our company or any other domestic airline may be owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not citizens of the United States.", "PERMNO": 90192, "SIC": 4512, "TIC": "RJETQ"}
