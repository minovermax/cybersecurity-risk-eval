{"cik": "1067837", "company": "ENTERCOM COMMUNICATIONS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nMany statements contained in this report are forward-looking in nature. See \u201cNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d These statements are based on current plans, intentions or expectations, and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans, intentions or expectations. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are the following:\nBUSINESS RISKS\nOur results may be impacted by economic trends.\nOur net revenues increased in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of acquisitions made during 2017. Excluding the net revenues from those radio stations divested, exchanged or operated by third-parties as part of the Merger, net revenues were up in the low-single digits for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted by economic fluctuations or by future economic downturns. Also, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions. The risks associated with our business could be more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising. A decrease in advertising expenditures could adversely impact our business, financial condition and result of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse impact on our ability to access capital, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like or need to do so, which could have an adverse impact on our capacity to react to changing economic and business conditions.\nOur radio stations may be adversely affected by changes in programming and competition for advertising revenues.\nWe operate in a highly competitive business. Our radio stations compete for audiences with advertising revenue as our principal source of income. We compete directly with other radio stations, as well as with other media, such as broadcast, cable and satellite television, satellite radio and pure-play digital audio, newspapers and magazines, national and local digital services, outdoor advertising and direct mail. We also compete for advertising dollars with other large companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. Audience ratings and market shares are subject to change, and any decrease in our listenership ratings or market share in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our stations located in that market. Audience ratings and market shares could be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the format or content of programming (some of which may be outside of our control), personnel changes, demographic shifts and general broadcast listening trends. Adverse changes in any of these areas or trends could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile we already compete in some of our markets with stations with similarly programmed formats, if another radio station in a market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to one of our stations or if an existing competitor were to garner additional market share, our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and/or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses. Competing companies may be larger and/or have more financial resources than we do. There can be no assurance that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues.\nWe may be unable to effectively integrate our acquisitions, including the Merger with the CBS Radio business.\nThe integration of acquisitions involves numerous risks.\nIn particular, we now have significantly more sales, assets and employees than we did prior to the Merger. The integration process requires us to expend significant capital and expand the scope of our operations and financial systems. We have been required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the process of integrating the operations of the CBS Radio business. There is a great degree of difficulty and management involvement inherent in that process, which is not yet complete. These difficulties include:\n\u2022\nContinuing the integration process of the CBS Radio business while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business;\n\u2022\nmanaging a significantly larger company than before consummation of the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the integration process;\n\u2022\ncoordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations;\n\u2022\nCBS Radio\u2019s performance in the past was well below others in the industry and we may not be able to improve their results;\n\u2022\nretaining existing customers and attracting new customers;\n\u2022\nthe potential diversion of management\u2019s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters;\n\u2022\nmanaging tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company;\n\u2022\nunforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Merger;\n\u2022\nintegrating two separate employee cultures;\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining the necessary personnel for the combined company;\n\u2022\ncreating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and\n\u2022\nintegrating accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll, purchasing and regulatory compliance systems.\nThere is no assurance that the CBS Radio business will be successfully or cost-effectively integrated into our business. The process of integrating the CBS Radio business into our operations may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. If we are not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer and our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nIf any of the Internal Distributions or the Final Distribution does not qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) or the Merger does not qualify as a tax-free \u201creorganization\u201d under Section 368(a) of the Code, including as a result of actions taken in connection with the Internal Distributions, the Final Distribution or the Merger or as a result of subsequent acquisitions of shares of CBS, Entercom or CBS Radio, then CBS and/or holders of CBS Common Stock that received Radio Common Stock in the Final Distribution may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes, and, in certain circumstances, CBS Radio (now known as \u201cEntercom Media Corp.\u201d) and Entercom may be required to indemnify CBS for any such tax liability.\nStockholders of CBS generally will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the exchange offer or the Merger, except for any gain or loss attributable to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Entercom Class A Common Stock received in the Merger. CBS received an opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to CBS, that each of the Internal Distributions and the Final Distributions qualified as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code (the \u201cDistribution Tax Opinion\u201d).\nIt was intended that the Merger qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It was a condition to Entercom\u2019s obligation to complete the Merger that Entercom receive an opinion from Latham & Watkins LLP, counsel to Entercom, to the effect that the Merger be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and it was a condition to CBS and CBS Radio\u2019s obligations to complete the Merger that CBS receive an opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to CBS, to the effect that the Merger be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (each such opinion, a \u201cMerger Tax Opinion\u201d).\nThe Separation Agreement provided that if the condition that the Distribution Tax Opinion be delivered is waived by CBS, then unless such condition cannot be met solely as a result of one or more events, facts or circumstances that are not within the control of CBS, CBS shall pay to Entercom the Tax Opinion Waiver Penalty. The \u201cTax Opinion Waiver Penalty\u201d means a dollar amount equal to the product of (a) the sum of (i) the number of shares of CBS Common Stock subject to CBS options held by CBS Radio employees immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and (ii) the number of CBS Restricted Stock Unit (\u201cRSU\u201d) awards held by a CBS Radio employee outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, multiplied by (b) the Tax Opinion Waiver Ratio Impact, multiplied by (c) the volume-weighted average per share closing price of Entercom Class A Common Stock for the five consecutive trading days beginning 15 trading days prior to the date CBS publicly discloses that it has waived the condition regarding the Distribution Tax Opinion (the \u201cTax Opinion Waiver Date\u201d), as listed on the NYSE (the \u201cEntercom Unaffected Stock Value\u201d). The \u201cTax Opinion Waiver Ratio Impact\u201d means an amount equal to the greater of (a) (i) the quotient obtained by dividing the (A) volume-weighted average per-share closing price of CBS Class B Common Stock on the five trading days immediately prior to the date of the consummation of the Merger, as listed on the NYSE, by (B) volume-weighted average per-share closing price of Entercom Class A common Stock on the five trading days immediately following the date of the consummation of the Merger, as listed on the NYSE, minus (ii) (A) the volume-weighted average per-share closing price of CBS Class B Common Stock for the five consecutive trading days beginning 15 trading days prior to the Tax Opinion Waiver Date, as listed on the NYSE, divided by (B) the Entercom Unaffected Stock Value, or (b) zero.\nThe consummation of the separation of the radio business from the other businesses of CBS pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement (the \u201cSeparation\u201d and, together with the other transactions contemplated in the Separation Agreement and the CBS Radio Merger Agreement, the \u201cTransactions\u201d) was conditioned on the receipt by CBS of the Distribution Tax Opinion and a Merger Tax Opinion and by Entercom of a Merger Tax Opinion and a copy of the Distribution Tax Opinion.\nEntercom, CBS, CBS Radio and Merger Sub or their respective subsidiaries, in each case as applicable, have entered into certain other agreements relating to the Transactions and various interim and ongoing relationships between CBS, CBS Radio and Entercom.\nTo enable Entercom to manage an orderly transition in its operation of CBS Radio, CBS and Entercom entered into an agreement, pursuant to which CBS will provide certain services to Entercom in support of CBS Radio and Entercom will provide certain limited services to CBS for a period not to exceed twenty-four months following the consummation of the Transactions (the \u201cTransition Service Agreement\u201d).\nCBS Local Digital Media operates CBS local websites, which combine local radio and television content within markets where both CBS Radio and CBS television stations operate. CBS and Entercom entered into an agreement, pursuant to which CBS Local Digital Media will continue to operate the digital presences for CBS Radio\u2019s Sports and news Stations and CBS television stations (the \u201cJoint Digital Sales Agreement\u201d). The Joint Digital Sales Agreement represents a collaborative agreement between CBS and Entercom, providing for the sharing of revenues, costs and content, in connection with the operation of the CBS local websites.\nPursuant to an agreement executed by and between CBS Broadcasting, CBS Mass Media Corporation and other subsidiaries of CBS (together, the \u201cLicensors\u201d), Entercom Media Corp. and certain subsidiaries of Entercom Media Corp., as the licensees, Entercom Media Corp. will have the right to continue to use certain licensed trademarks and related property to operate various Entercom Media Corp. stations, subject to the terms and conditions of this license agreement (the \u201cTrademark License Agreement (TV Station Brands)\u201d). Pursuant to an agreement executed by and between CBS Broadcasting as licensor, CSTV Networks, Inc. d/b/a CBS Sports Network, on the one hand, and CBS Sports Radio Network Inc. and Entercom Media Corp., on the other hand as the licensees, the licensees will have the right to continue to use the CBS SPORTS RADIO trademark in connection with the CBS Sports Radio network and certain marketing and promotional uses (the \u201cTrademark License Agreement (CBS SPORTS RADIO Brand)\u201d and, together with the Trademark License Agreement (TV Station Brands), the \u201cTrademark License Agreements\u201d).\nConcurrently with the execution of the CBS Radio Merger Agreement, Entercom and Joseph M. Field, who held a controlling voting interest in Entercom, entered into a Voting Agreement dated as of February 2, 2017 (the \u201cVoting Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, Mr. Field committed to vote in favor of the issuance of shares of Entercom Class A Common Stock in the Merger, an amendment to Entercom\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (\u201cEntercom Articles\u201d) to provide that the Entercom board of directors will be classified after the Merger and not to tender into or vote for any alternative proposal for one year after the termination of the CBS Radio Merger Agreement (but only through the termination provisions as identified in the Voting Agreement).\nTogether, the Tax Matters Agreement (defined below), the Transition Service Agreement, the Joint Digital Services Agreement and the Trademark License Agreements are referred to as the \u201cAncillary Agreements.\u201d The Ancillary Agreements together with the Voting Agreement, the Side Letter, CBS Radio Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement, are referred to as the \u201cTransaction Agreements\u201d.\nThe opinions of counsel were based upon and relied on, among other things, current law, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements, and undertakings of CBS, CBS Radio (now Entercom Media Corp.), Entercom, and Merger Sub, including those relating to the past and future conduct of CBS, CBS Radio, Entercom, and Merger Sub. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if CBS, Entercom Media Corp., Entercom, or Merger Sub breaches any of its covenants in the Transaction Agreements, the opinions of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. Notwithstanding the opinions of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could determine that the Final Distribution and/or the Merger should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings upon which the opinions of counsel were based are false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions of counsel. The opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position.\nIf the Final Distribution fails to qualify as a transaction that is tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Section 355 of the Code, in general, CBS would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the Radio Common Stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and holders of CBS Common Stock who received shares of Radio Common Stock in the Final Distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nEven if the Final Distribution were to otherwise qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code, the Final Distribution or either Internal Distribution would be taxable to CBS (but not to CBS stockholders) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership of either CBS or CBS Radio (including stock of Entercom after the Merger), directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Final Distribution or such Internal Distribution, as applicable. For this purpose, any acquisitions of CBS or CBS Radio stock (including stock of Entercom after the Merger) within the period beginning two years before the Final Distribution or such Internal Distribution, as applicable, and ending two years after the Final Distribution or such Internal Distribution, as applicable, are presumed to be part of such a plan, although CBS may be able to rebut that presumption. Further, for purposes of this test, the Merger will be treated as part of such a plan, but the Merger standing alone should not cause the Final Distribution or either Internal Distribution to be taxable to\nCBS under Section 355(e) of the Code because pre-Merger holders of Radio Common Stock will hold at least 50.25% of the aggregate value of Entercom Common Stock and at least 50.25% of the aggregate voting power of Entercom Common Stock, in each case, immediately following the Merger. However, if the IRS were to determine that other acquisitions of CBS or CBS Radio stock (including stock of Entercom after the Merger), either before or after the Final Distribution or either Internal Distribution, were part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the Final Distribution or such Internal Distribution, as applicable, such determination could result in significant tax to CBS.\nUnder the agreement entered into by CBS, CBS Radio, and Entercom in connection with the Transactions, CBS Radio (and Entercom, if applicable) will be required to indemnify CBS against all or a portion of any taxes on the Internal Distributions and Final Distribution that arise as a result of certain actions or failures to act by Entercom or CBS Radio, certain events (or series of events) after the Transactions involving the stock or assets of CBS Radio or Entercom, or any breach by Entercom or, after the Transactions, CBS Radio of any representation or covenant made by them in the agreement (the \u201cTax Matters Agreement\u201d) (a \u201cdisqualifying action\u201d). If CBS were to recognize gain on either Internal Distribution or the Final Distribution for reasons not related to a disqualifying action by CBS Radio or Entercom, CBS would generally not be entitled to be indemnified under the Tax Matters Agreement and the resulting tax to CBS could have a material adverse effect on CBS. In addition, in certain circumstances, under the Tax Matters Agreement, CBS Radio (and Entercom) will be required to indemnify CBS against taxes on the Merger that arise as a result of a disqualifying action by CBS Radio or Entercom. If CBS were to recognize gain on the Merger for reasons not related to a disqualifying action by CBS Radio or Entercom, CBS would generally not be entitled to indemnification by CBS Radio (or Entercom) under the Tax Matters Agreement. If CBS Radio (or Entercom, if applicable) is required to indemnify CBS if the Final Distribution or the Merger is taxable, this indemnification obligation could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on Entercom, including with respect to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if Entercom and CBS Radio are not responsible for tax liabilities of CBS under the Tax Matters Agreement, CBS Radio nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if CBS were to fail to pay such taxes.\nEntercom Media Corp. and Entercom may be affected by significant restrictions following the Transactions in order to avoid significant tax-related liabilities.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement generally prohibits Entercom Media Corp., Entercom and their affiliates from taking certain actions that could cause the Internal Distributions, the Final Distribution and the Merger to fail to qualify as tax-free transactions. In particular, for a two-year period following the date of the Final Distribution (the \u201cFinal Distribution Date\u201d), except as described below, neither Entercom Media Corp. nor Entercom may:\n\u2022\nenter into any transaction or series of transactions (or any agreement, understanding or arrangement) as a result of which one or more persons would acquire (directly or indirectly) stock comprising 50% or more of the vote or value of Entercom Media Corp. or Entercom (taking into account the stock of CBS Radio acquired pursuant to the Merger);\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase any stock or stock rights, other than in certain open-market transactions;\n\u2022\namend its certificate of incorporation or take any other action affecting the relative voting rights of its capital stock;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with any other person (other than pursuant to the Merger or mergers or consolidations that do not result in Entercom Media Corp. ceasing to exist as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes);\n\u2022\ntake any other actions that would, when combined with any other direct or indirect changes in ownership of Entercom Media Corp. and Entercom capital stock (including pursuant to the Merger), have the effect of causing one or more persons to acquire stock comprising 50% or more of the vote or value of Entercom Media Corp. or Entercom, or would reasonably be expected to result in a failure to preserve the tax-free status of the Transactions;\n\u2022\ncause Entercom Media Corp. to liquidate;\n\u2022\ncause Entercom Media Corp. to discontinue the active conduct of certain of its businesses; or\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets (including stock of subsidiaries) of certain of Entercom Media Corp.\u2019s business beyond certain thresholds (subject to exceptions for, among other things, ordinary course dispositions and repayments or prepayments of Entercom Media corp. debt).\nIf Entercom Media Corp. (or Entercom, if applicable) intends to take any such restricted action, Entercom Media Corp. (or Entercom, if applicable) will be required to cooperate with CBS in obtaining an IRS ruling or an unqualified tax opinion satisfactory to CBS in its reasonable discretion to the effect that such action will not affect the status of any of the Internal Distributions, the Final Distribution or the Merger as tax-free transactions, unless CBS waives such requirement. However, if Entercom Media Corp. (or Entercom, if applicable) takes any of the actions above and such actions result in tax-related losses to CBS, then Entercom Media Corp. (or Entercom, if applicable) generally will be required to indemnify CBS for such losses, without regard to whether CBS has given Entercom Media Corp. and/or Entercom prior consent. In the event CBS does not receive a tax opinion from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz concluding at a comfort level of \u201cshould\u201d or higher that each of the Internal Distributions and the Final Distribution qualifies as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code or takes or fails to take, or permits any of its affiliates to take or fail to take, any action solely as a result of which (together with other actions or failures to act by CBS and its affiliates) either of the Internal Distributions and/or the Final Distribution would reasonably be expected to fail to qualify as tax-free transactions, then the restrictions set forth above shall not apply.\nDue to these restrictions and indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement, Entercom may be limited in its ability to pursue strategic transactions, equity or convertible debt financings or other transactions that may otherwise be in Entercom\u2019s best interests. Also, Entercom\u2019s potential indemnity obligation to CBS might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control during this two-year period that Entercom shareholders may consider favorable and its ability to pursue strategic transactions, equity or convertible debt financings, or other transactions that may otherwise be in Entercom\u2019s best interests.\nThe loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key personnel. We believe that the loss of one or more of these individuals could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur radio stations compete for creative and on-air talent with other radio stations and other media, such as broadcast, cable and satellite television, digital media and satellite radio. Our on-air talent are subject to change, due to competition and for other reasons. Changes in on-air talent could materially and negatively affect our ratings and our ability to attract local and national advertisers, which could in turn adversely affect our revenues.\nThe Merger with CBS Radio may not achieve its intended benefits.\nEven if we are able to successfully combine the two business operations, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits of the increased sales volume and other benefits, including the expected synergies, which we anticipate will result from the Merger, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected. For example, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, or the benefits from the Merger may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from the acquisition, our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe have incurred transaction- and merger-related costs in connection with the Merger.\nWe have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring direct and indirect costs associated with the Merger. These costs and expenses include fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, severance and other potential employment-related costs, including payments that may be made to certain Entercom and former CBS Radio executives, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges. There are also processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the Merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection with the Merger and the other operations contemplated by the CBS Radio Merger Agreement and continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses.\nThere may also be additional unanticipated costs in connection with the Merger that we may not recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the realization of efficiencies and strategic benefits we can expect to achieve from the Merger. Although we expect that these benefits will offset the transaction expenses and implementation costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.\nIncreases in or new royalties, including through legislation, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe pay royalties to song composers and publishers through performance rights organizations (\u201cPROs\u201d), currently American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), SESAC, Inc. and Global Music Rights (\u201cGMR\u201d) for the performance of music on our radio stations and websites. The emergence of new PROs could increase the royalties that we pay. Although we pay royalties to record labels and recording artists for distributing music content online, we do not pay royalties to record labels or recording artists for terrestrial broadcasts of music on our radio stations. From time to time, Congress considers legislation that could require that radio broadcasters pay performance royalties on terrestrial broadcasts of music to record labels and recording artists. The proposed legislation has been the subject of considerable debate and activity by the radio broadcast industry and other parties that could be affected. We cannot predict whether any proposed legislation will become law. In addition, royalty rates are subject to adjustment and it is possible that our royalty rates associated with obtaining rights to use musical compositions and sound recordings in our programming content could increase as a result of private negotiations, regulatory rate-setting processes, or administrative and court decisions. Various independent record companies that claim to own the rights to several hundred sound recordings created prior to February 15, 1972 (the \u201cPre-1972 Recordings\u201d) have sued several radio broadcasters (including CBS Radio) for allegedly infringing their exclusive right of public performance in certain states. In August 2015, CBS Radio was named as a defendant in two separate putative class action lawsuits in a federal court in each of California and New York for common law copyright infringement as well as related state law claims. In May 2016, the California court dismissed the California case against CBS Radio. In June 2016, the plaintiff record companies appealed this judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In March 2017, the New York federal court dismissed the New York suit with prejudice. In the California case, the plaintiffs sought to certify a class action related to other pre-1972 recordings. The California trial court: (a) struck the class certification claims; and (b) granted summary judgment in CBS\u2019 favor on the basis that CBS had publicly performed post-1972 digitally remastered recordings; those remastered recordings were derivative works sufficiently original to be copyrightable; and thus those works were governed exclusively by federal law, rather than California state law which governs the public performance of the original recordings. In August 2018, the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court opinion. The Company filed a petition for rehearing en banc on September 18, 2018. That petition was denied, however, the original decision was amended in part. Following remand, the trial court entered a stay, pending the outcome of a separate case, Flo & Eddie, Inc. v. Pandora Media, Inc., in which the California Supreme Court will decide whether California law recognizes a public performance right for pre-1972 works. An adverse decision in the California case against the Company could impede our ability to broadcast or stream the Pre-1972 Recordings and/or increase our royalty payments, as well as expose the Company to liability for past broadcasts. New or increased royalty payments could increase our expenses, which could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited rights to use the trademark,\u201d \u201cCBS Sports Radio\u201d and certain other trademarks owned by CBS, subject in each case to certain license agreements entered into upon consummation of the Merger. Certain trademarks may be limited to a period of no more than twelve months after the Merger. Any substantial failure to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights prior to the expiration of these rights to use Trademarks owned by CBS and its subsidiaries could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, early termination of the trademark licenses could result in our rebranding such trademarks before we are prepared to do so and could require that we spend significant unanticipated resources.\nOur ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is important to the success of our business. We endeavor to protect our intellectual property under trade secret, trademark, copyright and patent law, and through a combination of employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, other contractual restrictions, and other methods. We have registered trademarks in state and federal trademark offices in the United States and enforce our rights through, among other things, filing oppositions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Offices. There is a risk that unauthorized digital distribution of our content could occur, and competitors may adopt names similar to ours or use confusingly similar terms as keywords in internet search engine advertising programs, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and leading to confusion among our audience or advertisers. Moreover, maintaining and policing our intellectual property rights may require us to spend significant resources as litigation or proceedings\nbefore the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, courts or other administrative bodies, is unpredictable and may not always be cost-effective. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property. The failure to protect and enforce our intellectual property could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims and litigation from third parties claiming that our operations infringe on their intellectual property. Any intellectual property litigation could be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any such actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to operate our business.\nWe cannot predict the competitive effect on the radio broadcasting industry of changes in audio content distribution, changes in technology or changes in regulations.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services. We may lack the resources to acquire new technologies or introduce new services to allow us to compete with these new offerings. Competing technologies and services, some of which are commercial-free, include: personal audio devices; national and local digital audio services; satellite-delivered digital radio services; smart speaker driven services; content available over the Internet; HD Radio, which provides multi-channel, multi-format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional AM and FM radio services; and low-power FM radio, which could result in additional FM radio broadcast outlets, including additional low-power FM radio signals authorized under the Local Community Radio Act of 2010.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory changes may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive regulations and are dependent on federally-issued licenses to operate our radio stations. Failure to comply with such regulations could damage our business.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. See Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting under Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d We are required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate our radio stations. Licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable. Although the vast majority of FCC radio station licenses are routinely renewed, there can be no assurance that the FCC will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications. During the periods when a renewal application is pending, informal objections and petitions to deny the renewal application can be filed by interested parties, including members of the public, on a variety of grounds. The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of our licenses could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations. FCC regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market, which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations. The FCC\u2019s rules governing our radio station operations impose costs on our operations, and changes in those rules could have an adverse effect on our business. The FCC also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations. If the FCC relaxes these technical requirements, it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation. Moreover, these FCC regulations may change over time, and there can be no assurance that changes would not adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are currently the subject of several pending investigations by the FCC.\nCongress or federal agencies that regulate us could impose new regulations or fees on our operations that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThere has been in the past and there could be again in the future proposed legislation that requires radio broadcasters to pay additional fees such as a spectrum fee for the use of the spectrum. In addition, there has been proposed legislation which would impose a new royalty fee that would be paid to record labels and performing artists for use of their recorded music. It is currently unknown what impact any potential required royalty payments or fees would have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on selected market clusters of radio stations for a material portion of our revenues.\nFor 2018, we generated over 50% of our as reported net revenues in 10 of our 48 markets, which were Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Accordingly, we have greater exposure to adverse events or conditions in any of these markets, such as changes in the economy, shifts in population or demographics, or changes in audience tastes, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining key employees as a result of the merger with CBS Radio.\nAs a result of the Merger, our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Key employees may depart because of the uncertainty or potential difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company.\nImpairments to our broadcasting licenses and goodwill have reduced our earnings.\nWe have incurred impairment charges that resulted in non-cash write-downs of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill. A significant amount of these impairment losses were recorded in 2008 during the recession, and the most recent impairment loss to goodwill and broadcasting licenses was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of an interim impairment assessment. As of December 31, 2018, our broadcasting licenses and goodwill comprised approximately 76% of our total assets. Subsequent to the annual impairment test conducted during the second quarter of 2018, we determined that a sustained decrease in our share price required us to conduct an interim impairment assessment on our broadcasting licenses and goodwill. Due to changes in facts and circumstances, we revised our estimates with respect to our estimated operating profit margins and long-term revenue growth rates used in the interim impairment assessment. The interim impairment conducted during the fourth quarter of the current year indicated that the carrying value of our goodwill and broadcasting licenses exceeded their respective carrying amount. Accordingly, we recorded a $147.9 million impairment charge ($108.8 million, net of tax) on our broadcasting licenses and a $317.1 million impairment charge ($314.4 million, net of tax) on our goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2018. The valuation of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill is subjective and based on our estimates and assumptions rather than precise calculations. The fair value measurements for both our broadcast licenses and goodwill use significant unobservable inputs and reflect our own assumptions, including market share and profit margin for an average station, growth within a radio market, estimates of costs and losses during early years, potential competition within a radio market and the appropriate discount rate used in determining fair value. If events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the broadcasting licenses and goodwill below the amount reflected on the balance sheet, we may be required to recognize impairment charges, which may be material, in future periods. Current accounting guidance does not permit a valuation increase.\nWe have significant obligations relating to our current operating leases.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had future operating lease commitments of approximately $394.3 million that are disclosed in Note 20, Contingencies And Commitments, in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements. We are required to make certain estimates at the inception of a lease in order to determine whether the lease is operating or capital. In February 2016, the accounting guidance was modified to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The most notable change in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases with a term of more than one year. This change will apply to our leased assets such as real estate and broadcasting towers. While we are currently reviewing the effects of this guidance, we believe that this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets but will not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations. We believe that this modification to operating leases would result in: (i) an increase in the ROU assets and lease liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets to reflect the rights and obligations created by operating leases with a term of greater than one year; and (ii) no material change to the expense associated with the ROU assets. This guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2019.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems, and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nThe proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. If these information technology systems fail or are interrupted, our\noperations and operating results may be adversely affected. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the future growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party providers, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control. These include catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, computer system or network failures and natural disasters. Any material disruption, malfunction or similar challenges with our business processes or information systems, or disruptions or challenges relating to the transition to new processes, systems or providers, could adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe FCC has engaged in vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFCC regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Over the last decade, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency and has threatened on more than one occasion to initiate license revocation proceedings against a broadcast licensee who commits a \u201cserious\u201d indecency violation. Congress has dramatically increased the penalties for broadcasting obscene, indecent or profane programming, and these penalties may potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation, renewal or qualification proceedings in the event that they broadcast such material. In addition, the FCC\u2019s heightened focus on the indecency regulatory scheme, against the broadcast industry generally, may encourage third parties to oppose our license renewal applications or applications for consent to acquire broadcast stations. We may in the future become subject to inquiries or proceedings related to our stations\u2019 broadcast of obscene, indecent or profane material. To the extent that these inquiries or other proceedings result in the imposition of fines, a settlement with the FCC, revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely impacted.\nCybersecurity threats could have a material adverse effect on our business\nThe use of our computers and digital technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations give rise to cybersecurity risks, including viruses or malware, physical or electronic intrusions and unauthorized access to our data. A cybersecurity attack could compromise confidential information. There can be no assurance that we, or the security systems we implement, will protect against all of these rapidly changing risks. A cybersecurity incident could increase our operating costs, disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, or subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data. We maintain insurance coverage against certain of such risks, but cannot guarantee that such coverage will be applicable or sufficient with respect to any given incident or on-going incidents that go undetected.\nCybersecurity breaches may increase our costs and cause losses.\nOur security systems and processes, which are designed to protect information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, cannot provide absolute security. Cybersecurity breaches could result in an increase in costs related to redeveloping our systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory investigation, and other remediation costs associated with cybersecurity incidents.\nWe are exposed to credit risk on our accounts receivable. This risk is heightened during periods of uncertain economic conditions.\nOur outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables, which risk is heightened during periods of uncertain economic conditions, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and enable us to avoid losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe rely on key contracts and business relationships, and if our business partners or contracting counterparties fail to perform, or terminate, any of their contractual arrangements with us for any reason or cease operations, our business could be disrupted and our revenues could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on key contracts and business relationships, and if our business partners or contracting counterparties fail to perform, or terminate, any of their contractual arrangements with us for any reason or cease operations, our business could be disrupted and our revenues could be adversely affected. For instance, if\none of our business partners or counterparties is unable (including as a result of any bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding) or unwilling to continue operating in the line of business that is the subject of our contract, we may not be able to obtain similar relationships and agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. The failure to perform or termination of any of the agreements by a partner or a counterparty, the discontinuation of operations of a partner or counterparty, the loss of good relations with a partner or counterparty or our inability to obtain similar relationships or agreements, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, we had a senior secured credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) of $1.5 billion outstanding that is comprised of: (a) a $1,291.7 million term B-1 loan (the \u201cTerm B-1 Loan\u201d) and (b) a $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolver\u201d), of which $180.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2018. In addition to the Credit Facility, we also have outstanding $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.250% senior notes due October 2024 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d).\nThis significant amount of indebtedness could have an adverse impact on us. For example, these obligations:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to and limit the flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate, the economy and government regulations;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions including share repurchases\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowing under the Term B-1 Loan and Revolver are subject to variable rates of interest; and\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nThe undrawn amount of the Revolver was $64.1 million as of December 31, 2018. The amount of the Revolver available to us is a function of covenant compliance at the time of borrowing. Based on our financial covenant analysis as of December 31, 2018, we would not be limited in these borrowings.\nWe may from time to time seek to amend our existing indebtedness agreements or obtain funding or additional debt financing, which may result in higher interest rates.\nThe terms of the Credit Facility and the Senior Notes may restrict our current and future operations.\nThe Credit Facility and the Indenture governing the Senior Notes (the \u201cSenior Notes Indenture\u201d) contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into Sale and Lease-Back Transactions (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture);\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nprepay certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u2022\nissue or sell stock; and\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business.\nAs a result of our substantial indebtedness, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions could hinder our ability to pursue our business strategy or inhibit our ability to adhere to our intended dividend policies.\nWe may still be able to incur substantial additional amounts of indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur substantial additional amounts of indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with the indebtedness described above. Although the terms of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and additional liens, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new indebtedness is added to our existing indebtedness levels, the related risks that we face would intensify, and we may not be able to meet all of our respective indebtedness obligations. The incurrence of additional indebtedness may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must comply with the covenants in our debt agreements, which restrict our operational flexibility.\nThe Credit Facility contains provisions which, under certain circumstances: limit our ability to borrow money; make acquisitions, investments or restricted payments, including without limitation dividends and the repurchase of stock; swap or sell assets; or merge or consolidate with another company. To secure the indebtedness under our Credit Facility, we have pledged substantially all of our assets, including the stock or equity interests of our subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Facility requires us to maintain compliance with a financial covenant, including a maximum Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) that cannot exceed 4.0 times as of December 31, 2018. Under certain circumstances, the Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio can increase to 4.5 times for a limited period of time.\nOur ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by operating performance or other events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will comply with these covenants. A default under the Credit Facility could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of these financial instruments and the failure to negotiate and obtain any required relief from our lenders could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding indebtedness and our lenders could proceed against our assets, including the equity interests of our subsidiaries. Under these circumstances, the acceleration of our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA breach of the covenants under the Senior Notes Indenture or under the Credit Facility could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement. Such a default would allow the lenders under the Credit Facility and/or the holders of the Senior Notes to accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an uncured event of default under the Credit Facility would also permit the lenders under the Credit Facility to terminate all other commitments to extend additional credit under the Credit Facility.\nFurthermore, if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Facility, those lenders could seek to foreclose on the collateral that secures such indebtedness. In the event that creditors accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nBecause of our holding company structure, we depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow, and our access to this cash flow is restricted.\nWe operate as a holding company. All of our radio stations are currently owned and operated by our subsidiaries. Entercom Media Corp., our 100% owned subsidiary, is the borrower under the Credit Facility. All of our station operating subsidiaries and FCC license subsidiaries are subsidiaries of Entercom Media Corp. Entercom Media Corp.\u2019s subsidiaries are all full and unconditional joint and several guarantors under the Credit Facility.\nAs a holding company, our only source of cash to pay our obligations, including corporate overhead and other expenses, is cash distributed from our subsidiaries. We currently expect that the majority of the net earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations, including servicing Entercom Media Corp.\u2019s indebtedness obligations. Even if our subsidiaries elect to make distributions to us, there can be no assurance that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including the restricted payments covenants contained in our Credit Facility, would permit such dividends or distributions.\nOur variable-rate indebtedness gives rise to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. Any increase in our debt service obligations could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBorrowings under the Term B-1 Loan and the Revolver are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations under the Credit Facility could increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, could correspondingly decrease.\nAs of December 31, 2018, if the borrowing rates under London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) were to increase 100 basis points above the current rates, our interest expense on: (i) the Term B-1 Loan would increase $12.9 million on an annual basis; and (ii) the Revolver would increase by $2.5 million, assuming our entire Revolver was outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nIn the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate risk. We may, however, not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable-rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. An increase in our debt service obligations could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo service our indebtedness and other cash needs, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to satisfy our indebtedness obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend in part upon our future financial and operating performance, and upon our ability renew or refinance borrowings. There can be no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to draw under the Revolver or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs, including the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness.\nPrevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make these payments.\nIf we are unable to make payments or refinance our indebtedness or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including:\n\u2022\nsales of assets;\n\u2022\nsales of equity;\n\u2022\nreduction or delay of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances; or\n\u2022\nnegotiations with lenders to restructure the applicable indebtedness.\nThese alternative measures may not be successful and may not enable us to meet scheduled indebtedness service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial conditions at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future indebtedness agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of sufficient cash flow from operating results and other resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value, or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our indebtedness obligations, or to refinance such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nAny decline in the ratings of our corporate credit or any indications from the rating agencies that their ratings on our corporate credit are under surveillance or review with possible negative implications could adversely impact our ability to access capital, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STOCK\nOur Chairman Emeritus and our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer own a large minority equity interest in us and have substantial influence over our Company. Their interests may conflict with your interest.\nAs of February 15, 2019, Joseph M. Field, our Chairman Emeritus, beneficially owned 10,444,334 shares of our Class A common stock; and 3,295,949 shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 24.9% of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock. As of February 15, 2019, David J. Field, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, one of our directors and the son of Joseph M. Field, beneficially owned 3,485,135 shares of our Class A common stock and 749,250 shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 6.3% of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock. Joseph M. Field and David J. Field, beneficially own all outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Other members of the Field family and trusts for their benefit also own shares of Class A common stock.\nShares of our Class B common stock are transferable only to Joseph M. Field, David J. Field, certain of their family members or trusts for any of their benefit. Upon any other transfer, shares of our Class B common stock automatically convert into shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. Shares of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes only when Joseph M. Field or David J. Field vote them, subject to certain exceptions when they are restricted to one vote. Joseph M. Field is able to significantly influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.\nOur Class A common stock price and trading volume could be volatile.\nOur Class A common stock has been publicly traded on the NYSE since January 29, 1999. The market price of our Class A common stock and our trading volume have been subject to fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could experience volatility, regardless of our operating performance.\nThe difficulties associated with any attempt to gain control of our Company could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock.\nThere are certain provisions contained in our articles of incorporation, by-laws and Pennsylvania law that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our Company. In addition, FCC approval for transfers of control of FCC licenses and assignments of FCC licenses is required. These restrictions and limitations could adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.", "PERMNO": 86560, "SIC": 4832, "TIC": "ETM"}
