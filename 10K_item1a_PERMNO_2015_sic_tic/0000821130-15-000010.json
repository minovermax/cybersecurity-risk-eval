U.S. Cellular undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K to understand the material risks relating to U.S. Cellular\u2019s business.\nRISK FACTORS\n1) Intense competition in the markets in which U.S. Cellular operates could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s revenues or increase its costs to compete.\nCompetition in the telecommunications industry is currently intense and could intensify further in the future due to the general effects of the economy, as well as due to multiple wireless industry factors such as increasing market penetration, decreasing customer churn rates, introduction of new products, new competitors and changing prices. There is competition in handsets and other devices; network quality, coverage, speed and technologies; distribution; pricing; and other categories. U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the telecommunications industry. U.S. Cellular anticipates that, in the future, competition may cause the prices for products and services to continue to decline and the costs to compete to increase. Most of U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors are national or global telecommunications companies that are larger than U.S. Cellular, possess greater resources, possess more extensive coverage areas and more spectrum within their coverage areas, and market other services with their communications services that U.S. Cellular does not offer. In addition, U.S. Cellular may face competition from technologies that may be introduced in the future or from new entrants into the industry. New technologies, services and products that are more commercially effective than the technologies, services and products offered by U.S. Cellular may be developed. Further, new technologies may be proprietary such that U.S. Cellular is not able to adopt such technologies. There can be no assurance that U.S. Cellular will be able to compete successfully in this environment.\nSources of competition to U.S. Cellular\u2019s business typically include two to four competing wireless telecommunications service providers in each market, wireline telecommunications service providers, cable companies, resellers (including mobile virtual network operators), and providers of other alternate telecommunications services. Many of U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless competitors and other competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources than U.S. Cellular.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors offer a wide array of wireless service offerings and wireless devices. There is increasing complexity associated with these wireless product and service offerings and the related pricing. Further, new wireless services and products and pricing structures are frequently introduced. Multiple events related to new services, products and pricing offered by U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors occurring simultaneously or in close proximity may impact U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to respond to such events and compete effectively.\nIf U.S. Cellular does not adapt to compete effectively in such a highly competitive environment, such competitive factors could result in product, service, pricing or cost disadvantages and could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n2) A failure by U.S. Cellular to successfully execute its business strategy (including planned acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges) or allocate resources or capital could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular is a regional wireless carrier that operates on a customer satisfaction strategy, seeking to meet customer needs by providing a comprehensive range of wireless products and services, excellent customer support, and a high-quality network. U.S. Cellular seeks to operate controlling interests in wireless licenses in areas adjacent to or in proximity to its other wireless licenses, thereby building contiguous operating market areas. U.S. Cellular relies on roaming agreements with other carriers to provide roaming capability to its customers in areas of the U.S. outside its service areas and to improve coverage within selected areas of U.S. Cellular\u2019s network footprint. U.S. Cellular pursues a product and technology strategy which requires it to recognize product and technology advances and quickly adopt and execute rollouts of such advances. This strategy requires U.S. Cellular to make timely and effective strategic decisions related to technological advances and related products and services, and which of these technological advances to adopt and roll out to its customers.\nFurther, U.S. Cellular\u2019s strategic decisions related to the adoption of new technologies are ultimately impacted by such factors as consumer preferences for technologies and the related services and products, and original equipment manufacturer (\u201cOEM\u201d) and standard bodies support of such technologies, including Long-Term Evolution (\u201cLTE\u201d) and VoLTE, among other factors. If U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors adopt new technologies faster than U.S. Cellular, then consumers who are eager to adopt new technologies more quickly may select U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors rather than U.S. Cellular as their service provider. These customers who are early adopters of new technologies are often customers who generate higher average revenue per unit (\u201cARPU\u201d), and to the extent that U.S. Cellular does not attract these types of customers, U.S. Cellular could be at a competitive disadvantage and have a customer base that generates lower overall ARPU relative to its competition.\nThe successful execution of strategy and optimal capital allocation decisions depend on various internal and external factors, many of which are not in U.S. Cellular\u2019s control. U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to implement and execute its business strategy and optimally allocate its assets and capital and, as a result, achieve desired financial results, could be affected by such factors. Such factors include pricing practices by competitors, relative scale, purchasing power, roaming and other strategic agreements, wireless device availability, timing of introduction of wireless devices and other factors. In addition, there is no assurance that U.S. Cellular\u2019s strategy will be successful. Even if U.S. Cellular executes its business strategy as intended, such strategy may not be successful in the long term to profitably sustain growth in revenue or otherwise.\nA failure by U.S. Cellular to execute its business strategy successfully or to allocate resources or capital optimally could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless business, financial condition or results of operations.\n3) U.S. Cellular offers customers the option to purchase certain devices under installment contracts, which creates certain risks and uncertainties which could have an adverse impact on U.S. Cellular's financial condition or results of operations.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2014, U.S. Cellular expanded its offerings of equipment installment plans. Such plans offer customers the option to purchase certain devices under installment contracts over a period of up to 24 months. U.S. Cellular expects that sales of devices under these plans, when compared to sales of devices made under the traditional subsidy model, will reduce retail service revenue and ARPU but increase equipment revenue. Such plans also are expected to result in lower cash flows from operating activities in the near term. However, at this time, U.S. Cellular does not have significant experience in these new plans or a sufficient history to determine how these plans will affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial position or results of operations.\nCompared to equipment sales made under the traditional subsidy model, these equipment installment plans involve different business risks and accounting considerations. These plans could adversely impact bad debts expense, marketing expense, customer churn, cash flows, inventory valuation, and other financial results and metrics.\n4) Changes in roaming practices or other factors could cause U.S. Cellular's roaming revenues to decline from current levels and/or impact U.S. Cellular's ability to service its customers in geographic areas where U.S. Cellular does not have its own network, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s service revenues include roaming revenues related to the use of U.S. Cellular\u2019s network by other carriers\u2019 customers who travel within U.S. Cellular\u2019s coverage areas. Changes in the network footprints of carriers due to mergers, acquisitions or network expansions could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s roaming revenues. For example, consolidation among other carriers which have network footprints that currently overlap U.S. Cellular\u2019s network could decrease the amount of roaming revenues for U.S. Cellular.\nSimilarly, U.S. Cellular's customers can access another carrier\u2019s digital system automatically only if the other carrier allows U.S. Cellular's customers to roam on its network. U.S. Cellular relies on roaming agreements with other carriers to provide roaming capability to its customers in areas of the U.S., Mexico and Canada outside of its service areas and to improve coverage within\nselected areas of U.S. Cellular's network footprint. Such agreements cover traditional voice services as well as data services. Although U.S. Cellular currently has long-term roaming agreements with certain other carriers, these agreements generally are subject to renewal and termination if certain events occur. FCC rules and orders impose certain requirements on wireless carriers to offer certain roaming arrangements to other carriers. However, carriers frequently disagree on what is required. Also, at this time, there is no assurance that U.S. Cellular will be able to enter into agreements to provide roaming services using 4G LTE or other technologies or that it will be able to do so on reasonable or cost-effective terms. In addition, see Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, Annual Report section \u201cRegulatory Matters - FCC Interoperability Order\u201d for further information and developments.\nSome competitors may be able to obtain lower roaming rates than U.S. Cellular is able to obtain because they have larger call volumes or may be able to reduce roaming charges by providing service principally over their own networks. In addition, the quality of service that a wireless carrier delivers during a roaming call may be inferior to the quality of service U.S. Cellular provides, the price of a roaming call may not be competitive with prices of other wireless carriers for such call, and U.S. Cellular\u2019s customers may not be able to use some of the advanced features, such as voicemail notification or data applications, that U.S. Cellular\u2019s customers enjoy when making calls on U.S. Cellular\u2019s network. U.S. Cellular\u2019s rate of adoption of new technologies, such as those enabling high-speed data services, could affect its ability to enter into or maintain roaming agreements with other carriers. In addition, U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless technology may not be compatible with technologies used by other carriers, which may limit the ability of U.S. Cellular to enter into voice or data roaming agreements with such other carriers. U.S. Cellular\u2019s roaming partners could switch their business to new operators or, over time, to their own networks. Changes in roaming usage patterns, rates for roaming minutes or data usage or relationships with carriers whose customers generate roaming minutes or data use on U.S. Cellular\u2019s network could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s revenues and revenue growth.\nTo the extent that U.S. Cellular\u2019s key roaming partners expand their networks in U.S. Cellular\u2019s service areas, the roaming arrangements between U.S. Cellular and these key roaming partners could become less strategic for the roaming partners. That is, these key roaming partners will have fewer or less extensive geographic areas where roaming services are required by their customers and, as a result, the roaming arrangements could become less critical to serving their customer base. This presents a risk to U.S. Cellular in that, to the extent U.S. Cellular is not able to enter into economically viable roaming arrangements with key roaming partners, this could impact U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to service its customers in geographic areas where U.S. Cellular does not have its own network.\nIf U.S. Cellular\u2019s roaming revenues decline, or if U.S. Cellular is unable to obtain or maintain roaming agreements with other wireless carriers that contain pricing and other terms that are competitive and acceptable to U.S. Cellular, and that satisfy U.S. Cellular\u2019s quality and interoperability requirements, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n5) A failure by U.S. Cellular to obtain access to adequate radio spectrum to meet current or anticipated future needs and/or to accurately predict future needs for radio spectrum could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s business depends on the ability to use portions of the radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. U.S. Cellular could fail to obtain access to sufficient spectrum capacity in new or existing critical markets, whether through FCC auctions or other transactions, in order to meet the anticipated spectrum requirements associated with increased demand for existing services, especially increases in customer demand for data services, and to enable deployment of next-generation services. U.S. Cellular believes that this increased demand for data services reflects a trend that will continue for the foreseeable future; as such, U.S. Cellular could fail to accurately forecast its future spectrum requirements considering changes in customer usage patterns, technology requirements and the expanded demands of new services. Such a failure could have an adverse impact on the quality of U.S. Cellular\u2019s services or U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to roll out such future services in some markets, or could require that U.S. Cellular curtail existing services in order to make spectrum available for next-generation services. Spectrum constrained providers could be effectively capped in increasing market share. As spectrum constrained providers gain customers, they use up their network capacity. Since they lack spectrum, they can respond to demand only by adding cell sites, which is capital intensive, limited by zoning considerations, and ultimately may not be cost effective. U.S. Cellular may acquire access to spectrum through a number of alternatives, including participation in spectrum auctions, partnering on a non-controlling basis with other auction applicants (\u201cOther Applicants\u201d) and other acquisitions and exchanges. As required by law, the FCC has conducted auctions for licenses to use some parts of the radio spectrum. The decision to conduct auctions, and the determination of what spectrum frequencies will be made available for auction and the determination of geographic size of licenses, are made by the FCC pursuant to laws that it administers. The FCC may not be able to allocate spectrum sufficient to meet the demands of all those wishing to obtain licenses for new market entry or to expand their spectrum holdings to meet the expanding demand for data services or to address other spectrum constraints. Due to factors such as geographic size of licenses and auction bidders that may raise prices beyond acceptable levels, U.S. Cellular or Other Applicants may not be successful in FCC auctions in obtaining the spectrum that either believes is necessary to implement its business and technology strategies. In addition, newly auctioned spectrum may not be compatible with existing spectrum, and vendors may not create suitable products to use such spectrum. Further, access to use spectrum won in FCC auctions may not be available on a timely basis. Such access is dependent upon the FCC actually granting licenses won in the various auctions, which can be delayed for various reasons. Furthermore, newly licensed spectrum may not be available for immediate use since the radio operations of incumbent users, including in some cases government agencies, may need to be relocated to other portions of the radio spectrum, and/or the newly licensed spectrum may be subject to sharing and coordination obligations for a period of time. U.S. Cellular also may seek to acquire radio spectrum through purchases and exchanges with other spectrum licensees. However, U.S. Cellular may not be able to acquire sufficient spectrum through these types of transactions, and U.S. Cellular may not be able to complete any of these transactions on favorable terms.\n6) To the extent conducted by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), U.S. Cellular is likely to participate in FCC auctions of additional spectrum in the future as an applicant or as a noncontrolling partner in another auction applicant and, during certain periods, will be subject to the FCC\u2019s anti-collusion rules, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular.\nFrom time to time, the FCC conducts auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services. U.S. Cellular has participated in such auctions in the past and is likely to participate in other auctions conducted by the FCC in the future as an applicant or as a non-controlling partner in another auction applicant. FCC anti-collusion rules place certain restrictions on business communications and disclosures by participants in an FCC auction. These anti-collusion rules may restrict the normal conduct of U.S. Cellular\u2019s business and/or disclosures by U.S. Cellular relating to an FCC auction, which could last three to six months or more. The restrictions could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n7) Changes in the regulatory environment or a failure by U.S. Cellular to timely or fully comply with any applicable regulatory requirements could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FCC, state public utility commissions and other federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. U.S. Cellular is unable to predict the future actions of the various regulatory bodies that govern U.S. Cellular, but such actions could have adverse effects on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business. New or amended regulatory requirements could increase U.S. Cellular\u2019s costs and divert resources from other initiatives.\nAdverse decisions, increased regulation, or changes to existing regulation by regulatory bodies could negatively impact U.S. Cellular\u2019s operations by, among other things, changing the amount that can be charged for local, intrastate or interstate access rates, increasing U.S. Cellular\u2019s costs of doing business, permitting greater competition or limiting U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to engage in certain sales or marketing activities. New regulatory mandates or enforcement may require unexpected or changed capital investment, lost revenues, changes in operations or other changes.\nCourt decisions and rulemakings could have a substantial impact on U.S. Cellular\u2019s operations, including rulemakings on intercarrier access compensation and state and federal universal service. Litigation and different objectives among federal and state regulators could create uncertainty and delay U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to respond to new regulations.\nU.S. Cellular attempts to timely and fully comply with all regulatory requirements. However, this may not be possible due to various factors. Any failure by U.S. Cellular to timely or fully comply with any regulatory requirements could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business.\nFor additional information about U.S. Cellular\u2019s regulatory environment, including the potential risk to a reduction in the current level of U.S. Cellular\u2019s revenues as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier, see \u201cRegulation\u201d in this Form 10-K and Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, Annual Report section \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d.\n8) An inability to attract people of outstanding potential, to develop their potential through education and assignments, and to retain them by keeping them engaged, challenged and properly rewarded could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s business is highly technical and competition for skilled talent in the wireless industry is aggressive. Due to competition for qualified management, technical, sales and other personnel, there can be no assurance that U.S. Cellular will be able to continue to attract and/or retain people of outstanding potential for the development of its business. The loss of the services of existing key personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional qualified personnel in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n9) U.S. Cellular\u2019s assets are concentrated in the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry. As a result, its results of operations may fluctuate based on factors related primarily to conditions in this industry.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s assets are concentrated in the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry and the United States. The U.S. wireless telecommunications industry is facing significant change and an uncertain operating environment. U.S. Cellular has not diversified its revenue streams beyond wireless telecommunications. U.S. Cellular\u2019s focus on the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry, together with its positioning relative to larger competitors with greater resources within the industry, may represent increased risk for investors due to the lack of diversification. This could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to profitably sustain long-term revenue growth and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\n10) U.S. Cellular\u2019s lower scale relative to larger competitors could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere has been a trend in the telecommunications and related industries in recent years towards consolidation of service providers through acquisitions, reorganizations and joint ventures. This trend could continue, leading to larger competitors over time. U.S. Cellular has lower scale efficiencies compared to larger competitors. U.S. Cellular may be unable to compete successfully with larger companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, purchasing and distribution resources or that offer more services than U.S. Cellular, which could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s revenues and costs of doing business. Specifically, U.S. Cellular\u2019s smaller scale relative to most of its competitors could have the following impacts, among others:\n\u00b7 Increased operating costs due to lack of leverage with vendors;\n\u00b7 Limited opportunities for strategic partnerships as potential partners are focused on wireless companies with greater scale;\n\u00b7 Limited access to content;\n\u00b7 Limited ability to influence industry standards;\n\u00b7 Reduced ability to invest in research and development of new products and services;\n\u00b7 Vendors may deem U.S. Cellular non-strategic and not develop or sell products and services to U.S. Cellular, particularly where technical requirements differ from those of larger companies;\n\u00b7 Limited access to intellectual property; and\n\u00b7 Other limited opportunities such as for software development or third party distribution.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s business increasingly depends on access to content for data, music or video services and access to new wireless devices being developed by vendors. U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to obtain such access depends in part on other parties. If U.S. Cellular is unable to obtain timely access to new content or wireless devices being developed by vendors, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the foregoing, U.S. Cellular\u2019s lower scale relative to larger competitors could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n11) Changes in various business factors could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in any of several factors could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 Demand for or usage of services, particularly data services;\n\u00b7 Customer preferences, including type of wireless devices;\n\u00b7 Customer perceptions of network quality and performance;\n\u00b7 The pricing of services;\n\u00b7 The overall size and growth rate of U.S. Cellular\u2019s customer base;\n\u00b7 Average revenue per customer;\n\u00b7 Penetration rates;\n\u00b7 Churn rates;\n\u00b7 Selling expenses;\n\u00b7 Net customer acquisition and retention costs;\n\u00b7 Customers\u2019 ability to pay for wireless service and the potential impact on bad debts expense;\n\u00b7 Roaming agreements and rates;\n\u00b7 Third-party vendor support;\n\u00b7 The mix of products and services offered by U.S. Cellular and purchased by customers; and\n\u00b7 The costs of providing products and services.\n12) Advances or changes in technology could render certain technologies used by U.S. Cellular obsolete, could put U.S. Cellular at a competitive disadvantage, could reduce U.S. Cellular\u2019s revenues or could increase its costs of doing business.\nThe telecommunications industry is experiencing significant changes in technologies and services expected by customers, as evidenced by evolving industry standards, ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter development cycles for new services and products, and enhancements and changes in end-user requirements and preferences. Widespread deployment of new technologies could cause the technology used on U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless networks or traditional circuit-switched telephone services to become less competitive or obsolete. Non-traditional competitors may try to dis-intermediate the wireless carrier and render it less valuable or obsolete. Future technological changes or advancements may enable other wireless technologies to equal or exceed U.S. Cellular\u2019s current levels of service and render its system infrastructure obsolete. U.S. Cellular may not be able to respond to such changes and implement new technology on a timely or cost-effective basis, which could reduce its revenues or increase its costs of doing business. If U.S. Cellular cannot keep pace with these technological changes or other changes in the telecommunications industry over time, its financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business could be adversely affected.\n13) Complexities associated with deploying new technologies present substantial risk.\nU.S. Cellular has selected 4G LTE technology as its approach to address demand for services enabled by fourth generation wireless technology. The deployment of 4G LTE technology is impacted by a number of technical challenges.\nManufacturers of wireless devices (\u201cOriginal Equipment Manufacturers\u201d or \u201cOEMs\u201d) must design and manufacture equipment that operates on the frequency bands available to U.S. Cellular. This may involve software and hardware support for such bands in wireless device chipsets as well as band-specific designs for components such as filters. OEMs, chipset manufacturers, and component manufacturers will likely prioritize the support of frequency bands that are specified by the largest wireless carriers. Given U.S. Cellular\u2019s smaller scale relative to its competitors, certain bands of spectrum licensed to U.S. Cellular in certain cases represent a lower priority for chipset and wireless device manufacturers. As a result, the timing and the availability of wireless devices to support U.S. Cellular\u2019s continued 4G LTE roll out could be negatively impacted. In addition, due to U.S. Cellular\u2019s relatively smaller scale, the cost of such equipment could be higher for U.S. Cellular than for U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors.\nAdditionally, the efficiency of LTE networks and the peak speeds they can provide are optimized when the technology is deployed in larger channel bandwidths that, in early releases of LTE, require larger amounts of contiguous spectrum. To the extent that U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors have access to larger contiguous spectrum positions, they may be able to offer faster speeds or provision their networks more efficiently. In order for U.S. Cellular to realize the same LTE data transfer speeds as competitors, it is important that both network infrastructure and device manufacturers support non-contiguous spectrum aggregation features for U.S. Cellular.\nLack of wireless devices available to U.S. Cellular to support its 4G LTE network, comparatively smaller spectrum positions for 4G LTE deployments, or carrier aggregation standards that result in U.S. Cellular delivering slower 4G LTE data transfer speeds relative to its competitors, could have an adverse impact on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n14) U.S. Cellular is subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments, and the applicability and the amount of these fees are subject to great uncertainty.\nTelecommunications providers pay a variety of surcharges and fees on their gross revenues from interstate and intrastate services, including USF fees and common carrier regulatory fees. The division of services between interstate services and intrastate services, including the divisions associated with the federal USF fees, is a matter of interpretation and may in the future be contested by the FCC or state authorities. The FCC also may change in the future the basis on which federal USF fees are charged. The Federal government and many states also apply transaction-based taxes to sales of U.S. Cellular products and services and to purchases of telecommunications services from various carriers. In addition, state regulators and local governments have imposed and may continue to impose various surcharges, taxes and fees on U.S. Cellular services. The applicability of these surcharges and fees to its services is uncertain in many cases and jurisdictions may contest whether U.S. Cellular has assessed and remitted those monies correctly. Periodically, state and federal regulators may increase or change the surcharges and fees U.S. Cellular currently pays. In some instances U.S. Cellular passes through these charges to its customers. However, Congress, the FCC, state regulatory agencies or state legislatures may limit the ability to pass through transaction-based tax liabilities, regulatory surcharges and regulatory fees imposed on U.S. Cellular to customers. U.S. Cellular may or may not be able to recover some or all of those taxes from its customers and the amount of taxes may deter demand for its services or increase its cost to provide service which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or operating results.\n15) Performance under device purchase agreements could have a material adverse impact on U.S. Cellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular has entered into purchase commitments with certain vendors and may enter into similar purchase commitments with other vendors in the future. If U.S. Cellular is unable to sell all of the devices that it is required to purchase under such agreements, or if it is unable to sell them at the prices it projects, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n16) Changes in U.S. Cellular\u2019s enterprise value, changes in the market supply or demand for wireless licenses, adverse developments in the business or the industry in which U.S. Cellular is involved and/or other factors could require U.S. Cellular to recognize impairments in the carrying value of its licenses, goodwill and/or physical assets.\nA large portion of U.S. Cellular\u2019s assets consists of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the form of licenses and goodwill. U.S. Cellular also has substantial investments in long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment. U.S. Cellular reviews its licenses, goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss may need to be recognized to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of such assets. The amount of any such impairment loss could be significant and could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s reported financial results for the period in which the loss is recognized. The estimation of fair values requires assumptions by management about factors that are uncertain including such things as future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate. Different assumptions for these factors could create materially different results.\n17) Costs, integration problems or other factors associated with acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges of properties or licenses and/or expansion of U.S. Cellular\u2019s business could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs part of U.S. Cellular\u2019s operating strategy, U.S. Cellular from time to time may be engaged in the acquisition, divestiture or exchange of companies, businesses, strategic properties, wireless spectrum or other assets. U.S. Cellular may change the markets in which it operates and the services that it provides through such acquisitions, divestitures and/or exchanges. In general, U.S. Cellular may not disclose the negotiation of such transactions until a definitive agreement has been reached.\nThese transactions commonly involve a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 Identification of attractive companies, businesses, properties, spectrum or other assets for acquisition or exchange, and/or the selection of U.S. Cellular\u2019s businesses or assets for divestiture or exchange;\n\u00b7 Competition for acquisition targets and the ability to acquire or exchange businesses at reasonable prices;\n\u00b7 Possible lack of buyers for businesses or assets that U.S. Cellular desires to divest and the ability to divest or exchange such businesses or assets at reasonable prices;\n\u00b7 Ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u00b7 Significant expenditures associated with acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges;\n\u00b7 Legal and regulatory risks associated with new businesses or markets;\n\u00b7 Ability to enter markets in which U.S. Cellular has limited or no direct prior experience and competitors have stronger positions;\n\u00b7 Ability to manage businesses that are engaged in activities other than traditional wireless service;\n\u00b7 Uncertain revenues and expenses associated with acquisitions, with the result that U.S. Cellular may not realize the growth in revenues, anticipated cost structure, profitability, or return on investment that it expects;\n\u00b7 Difficulty of integrating the technologies, services, products, operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, or of separating such matters for divested businesses or assets;\n\u00b7 Diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u00b7 Disruption of ongoing business;\n\u00b7 Impact on U.S. Cellular\u2019s cash and available credit lines for use in financing future growth and working capital needs;\n\u00b7 Inability to retain key personnel;\n\u00b7 Inability to successfully incorporate acquired assets and rights into U.S. Cellular\u2019s service offerings;\n\u00b7 Inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7 Possible conditions to approval by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission and/or the Department of Justice; and\n\u00b7 Impairment of relationships with employees, customers or vendors.\nNo assurance can be given that U.S. Cellular will be successful with respect to its acquisition, divestiture or exchange strategies or initiatives. If U.S. Cellular is not successful with respect to its acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n18) U.S. Cellular\u2019s investments in unproven technologies may not produce the benefits that U.S. Cellular expects.\nU.S. Cellular is making investments in various new technologies and service and product offerings. These investments include technologies for enhanced data service offerings. U.S. Cellular expects new services, products and solutions based on these new technologies to contribute to future growth in its revenues. However, the markets for some of these services, products and solutions are still emerging and the overall potential for these markets remains uncertain. If customer demand for these new services, products and solutions does not develop as expected, U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n19) A failure by U.S. Cellular to complete significant network construction and systems implementation activities as part of its plans to improve the quality, coverage, capabilities and capacity of its network, support and other systems and infrastructure could have an adverse effect on its operations.\nU.S. Cellular\u2019s business plan includes significant construction activities and enhancements to its network. As U.S. Cellular deploys, expands and enhances its network, it may need to acquire additional spectrum. Also, as U.S. Cellular continues to build out and enhance its network, U.S. Cellular must, among other things, continue to:\n\u00b7 Lease, acquire or otherwise obtain rights to cell and switch sites;\n\u00b7 Obtain zoning variances or other local governmental or third-party approvals or permits for network construction;\n\u00b7 Complete and update the radio frequency design, including cell site design, frequency planning and network optimization, for each of U.S. Cellular\u2019s markets; and\n\u00b7 Improve, expand and maintain customer care, network management, billing and other financial and management systems.\nAny difficulties encountered in completing these activities, as well as problems in vendor equipment availability, technical resources, system performance or system adequacy, could delay expansion of operations and product capabilities in new or existing markets or result in increased costs. Failure to successfully build out and enhance U.S. Cellular\u2019s network and necessary support facilities and systems in a cost-effective manner, and in a manner that satisfies customer expectations for quality and coverage, could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, business prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\n20) Difficulties involving third parties with which U.S. Cellular does business, including changes in U.S. Cellular's relationships with or financial or operational difficulties of key suppliers or independent agents and third party national retailers who market U.S. Cellular services, could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular has relationships with independent agents and third party national retailers who market U.S. Cellular services. If such relationships are seriously harmed or if such parties experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nU.S. Cellular depends upon certain vendors to provide it with equipment, services or content to continue its network construction and upgrades and to operate its business. U.S. Cellular does not have operational or financial control over such key suppliers and has limited influence with respect to the manner in which these key suppliers conduct their businesses. If these key suppliers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy or experience other operational difficulties, they may be unable to provide equipment,\nservices or content to U.S. Cellular on a timely basis or cease to provide such equipment, services or content or otherwise fail to honor their obligations to U.S. Cellular.\nRegulations regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries may affect some of U.S. Cellular\u2019s suppliers. These regulations may limit the availability of conflict free minerals and, as a result, U.S. Cellular may not be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices from its vendors who utilize such minerals in the manufacture of products. In such cases, U.S. Cellular may be unable to maintain and upgrade its network or provide products and services to its customers in a competitive manner, or could suffer other disruptions to its business. In that event, U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, operation of U.S. Cellular\u2019s supply chain and management of its inventory require accurate forecasting of customer growth and demand, which has become increasingly challenging. If overall demand for wireless devices or the mix of demand for wireless devices is significantly different than U.S. Cellular\u2019s expectations, U.S. Cellular could face inadequate or excess supplies of particular models of wireless devices. This could result in lost sales opportunities or an excess supply of inventory. Either of these situations could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s revenues, costs of doing business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn 2010, U.S. Cellular entered into agreements with a third party vendor to develop a Billing and Operational Support System (B/OSS). In 2014, U.S. Cellular entered into certain other agreements with such vendor that rearrange the structure under the original agreements, including arrangements pursuant to which U.S. Cellular now outsources certain support functions for its B/OSS to such vendor. Operational problems associated with the B/OSS, including any failure by the vendor to provide the required level of service under the outsourcing arrangements, could have adverse effects on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n21) U.S. Cellular has significant investments in entities that it does not control. Losses in the value of such investments could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular has significant investments in entities that it does not control, including equity investments and interests in certain variable interest entities. U.S. Cellular\u2019s interests in such entities do not provide U.S. Cellular with control over the business strategy, financial goals, network build-out plans or other operational aspects of these entities. U.S. Cellular cannot provide assurance that these entities will operate in a manner that will increase or maintain the value of U.S. Cellular\u2019s investments, that U.S. Cellular\u2019s proportionate share of income from these investments will continue at the current level in the future or that U.S. Cellular will not incur losses from the holding of such investments. Losses in the values of such investments or a reduction in income from these investments could adversely affect U.S. Cellular\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\n22) A failure by U.S. Cellular to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technology, or a material disruption thereof, could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular relies extensively on its telecommunication networks and information technology to operate and manage its business, process transactions and summarize and report results. These networks and technology become obsolete over time and must be upgraded, replaced and/or otherwise enhanced over time. Enhancements must be more flexible and dependable than ever before. All of this is capital intensive and challenging. A failure by U.S. Cellular to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technology could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe increased provision of data services has introduced significant new demands on U.S. Cellular\u2019s network and has also increased complexities related to network management. Further, the increased provision of data services on U.S. Cellular\u2019s networks has created an increased level of risk related to quality of service. This is due to the fact that many customers increasingly rely on data communications to execute and validate transactions. As a result, redundancy and geographical diversity of U.S. Cellular\u2019s network facilities are critical to providing uninterrupted service. Also, the speed of repair and maintenance procedures in the event of network interruptions is critical to maintaining customer satisfaction. U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to maintain high quality, uninterrupted service to its customers is critical, particularly given the increasingly competitive environment and customers\u2019 ability to choose other service providers.\nIn addition, U.S. Cellular\u2019s networks and information technology and the networks and information technology of vendors on which U.S. Cellular relies are subject to damage or interruption due to various events, including power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, hackers and other cyber security risks, catastrophic events, natural disasters, errors or unauthorized actions by employees and vendors, flawed conversion of systems, disruptive technologies and technology changes.\n23) Cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular experiences cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. U.S. Cellular maintains administrative, technical and physical controls, as well as other preventative actions, to reduce the risk of security breaches. Although to date U.S. Cellular has not experienced a material security breach, these efforts may be insufficient to prevent a security breach stemming from future cyber-attacks. If U.S. Cellular\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 networks and information technology are not adequately adapted to changes in technology or are damaged or fail to function properly, and/or if U.S. Cellular\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 security is breached or otherwise compromised, U.S. Cellular could suffer adverse consequences, including theft, destruction or other loss of critical and private data, including customer and/or employee data, interruptions or delays in its operations, inaccurate billings, inaccurate financial reporting, and significant costs to remedy the problems. If U.S. Cellular\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems become unavailable or suffer a security breach of customer or other data, U.S. Cellular may be required to expend significant resources and take various actions to address the problems, including notification under data privacy laws and regulations, may be subject to fines, sanctions and litigation, and its reputation and operating results could be adversely affected. Any material disruption in U.S. Cellular\u2019s networks or information technology, including security breaches, could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n24) The market price of U.S. Cellular\u2019s Common Shares is subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors.\nFactors that may affect the future market price of U.S. Cellular\u2019s Common Shares include:\n\u00b7 General economic conditions, including conditions in the credit and financial markets;\n\u00b7 Industry conditions;\n\u00b7 Fluctuations in U.S. Cellular\u2019s quarterly customer additions, churn rate, revenues, results of operations or cash flows;\n\u00b7 Variations between U.S. Cellular\u2019s actual financial and operating results and those expected by analysts and investors; and\n\u00b7 Announcements by U.S. Cellular\u2019s competitors.\nAny of these or other factors could adversely affect the future market price of U.S. Cellular\u2019s Common Shares, or could cause the future market price of U.S. Cellular\u2019s Common Shares to fluctuate from time to time.\n25) Changes in facts or circumstances, including new or additional information, could require U.S. Cellular to record charges in excess of amounts accrued in the financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires U.S. Cellular to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. U.S. Cellular bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in facts or circumstances, including new or additional information, could require U.S. Cellular to record charges in excess of amounts accrued in the financial statements, if any, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n26) Disruption in credit or other financial markets, a deterioration of U.S. or global economic conditions or other events could, among other things, impede U.S. Cellular\u2019s access to or increase the cost of financing its operating and investment activities and/or result in reduced revenues and lower operating income and cash flows, which would have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDisruptions in the credit and financial markets, declines in consumer confidence, increases in unemployment, declines in economic growth and uncertainty about corporate earnings could have a significant negative impact on the U.S. and global financial and credit markets and the overall economy. Such events could have an adverse impact on financial institutions resulting in limited access to capital and credit for many companies. Furthermore, economic uncertainties make it very difficult to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Changes in economic conditions, changes in financial markets, deterioration in the capital markets or other factors could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\n27) Uncertainty of U.S. Cellular\u2019s ability to access capital, deterioration in the capital markets, other changes in market conditions, changes in U.S. Cellular\u2019s credit ratings or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to U.S. Cellular, which could require U.S. Cellular to reduce its construction, development or acquisition programs.\nU.S. Cellular and its subsidiaries operate a capital-intensive business. U.S. Cellular has used internally-generated funds and has also obtained substantial funds from external sources to finance the build out and enhancement of markets, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. U.S. Cellular also may require substantial additional capital for, among other uses, acquisitions of providers of wireless telecommunications services, spectrum license or system acquisitions, system development and network capacity\nexpansion. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will continue to be available to U.S. Cellular or its subsidiaries on terms or at prices acceptable to U.S. Cellular. Changes in U.S. Cellular\u2019s credit rating, uncertainty of access to capital for telecommunications companies, deterioration in the capital markets, reduced regulatory capital at banks which in turn limits their ability to borrow and lend, other changes in market conditions or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to U.S. Cellular, which could require U.S. Cellular to reduce its construction, development and acquisition programs. Reduction of U.S. Cellular\u2019s construction, development and acquisition programs likely would have a negative impact on U.S. Cellular\u2019s consolidated revenues, income and cash flows.\n28) Settlements, judgments, restraints on its current or future manner of doing business and/or legal costs resulting from pending and future litigation could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular is regularly involved in a number of legal and policy proceedings before the FCC and various state and federal courts. Such legal and policy proceedings can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel.\nThe assessment of legal and policy proceedings is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events. Additionally, amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or resolution of litigation and other contingencies may differ materially from amounts accrued in the financial statements. Depending on a range of factors, these or similar proceedings could impose restraints on U.S. Cellular\u2019s current or future manner of doing business. Such potential outcomes could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or ability to do business.\n29) The possible development of adverse precedent in litigation or conclusions in professional studies to the effect that radio frequency emissions from wireless devices and/or cell sites cause harmful health consequences, including cancer or tumors, or may interfere with various electronic medical devices such as pacemakers, could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMedia reports and certain professional studies have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless devices may be linked to various health problems, including cancer or tumors, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. U.S. Cellular is a party to and may in the future be a party to lawsuits against wireless carriers and other parties claiming damages for alleged health effects, including cancer or tumors, arising from wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may discourage use of wireless devices or expose U.S. Cellular to potential litigation. In addition, the FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt regulations in response to concerns about radio frequency emissions. Any resulting decrease in demand for wireless services, costs of litigation and damage awards or regulation could have an adverse effect on U. S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, some studies have indicated that some aspects of using wireless devices while driving may impair drivers\u2019 attention in certain circumstances, making accidents more likely. These concerns could lead to potential litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries, any of which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNumerous state and local legislative bodies have enacted or proposed legislation restricting or prohibiting the use of wireless devices while driving motor vehicles. These enacted or proposed laws or other similar laws, if passed, could have the effect of reducing customer usage and/or increasing costs, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n30) Claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, primarily involving patent infringement claims, could prevent U.S. Cellular from using necessary technology to provide products or services or subject U.S. Cellular to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nU.S. Cellular faces possible effects of industry litigation relating to patents, other intellectual property or otherwise, that may restrict U.S. Cellular\u2019s access to devices for sale to customers. If technology that U.S. Cellular uses in products or services were determined by a court to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another person, U.S. Cellular could be precluded from using that technology and could be required to pay significant monetary damages. U.S. Cellular also may be required to pay significant royalties to such person to continue to use such technology in the future. The successful enforcement of any intellectual property rights, or U.S. Cellular\u2019s inability to negotiate a license for such rights on acceptable terms, could force U.S. Cellular to cease using the relevant technology and offering services incorporating the technology. Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that U.S. Cellular\u2019s products or services infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights of another, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the effort and attention of U.S. Cellular\u2019s management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, U.S. Cellular cannot give assurance that it would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and\ninherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. Although U.S. Cellular generally seeks to obtain indemnification agreements from vendors that provide it with technology, there can be no assurance that any claim of infringement will be covered by an indemnity or that U.S. Cellular will be able to recover all or any of its losses and costs under any available indemnity agreements. Any claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent U.S. Cellular from using necessary technology to provide its services or subject U.S. Cellular to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on U.S. Cellular\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n31) There are potential conflicts of interests between TDS and U.S. Cellular.\nTDS owns over 80% of the combined total of both classes of common stock of U.S. Cellular, including a majority of the outstanding Common Shares and 100% of the Series A Common Shares, and controls over 96% of their combined voting power. As a result, TDS is effectively able to elect all of U.S. Cellular\u2019s fourteen directors and otherwise control the management and operations of U.S. Cellular. Seven of the fourteen directors of U.S. Cellular are also directors of TDS and/or executive officers of TDS and/or U.S. Cellular. Directors and officers of TDS who are also directors or officers of U.S. Cellular, and TDS as U.S. Cellular\u2019s controlling shareholder, are in positions involving the possibility of conflicts of interest with respect to certain transactions concerning U.S. Cellular. When the interests of TDS and U.S. Cellular diverge, TDS may exercise its influence in its own best interests.\nU.S. Cellular and TDS have entered into contractual arrangements governing certain transactions and relationships between them. These agreements were executed prior to the initial public offering of U.S. Cellular\u2019s Common Shares and were not the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the terms and conditions of these agreements are as favorable to U.S. Cellular as could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nConflicts of interest may arise between TDS and U.S. Cellular when faced with decisions that could have different implications for U.S. Cellular and TDS, including technology decisions, financial budgets, the payment of distributions by U.S. Cellular, agreements or transactions between TDS and U.S. Cellular, business activities and other matters. TDS also may take action that favors its other businesses and the interests of its shareholders over U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless business and the interests of U.S. Cellular shareholders and debt holders. Because TDS controls U.S. Cellular, conflicts of interest could be resolved in a manner adverse to U.S. Cellular and its other shareholders or its debt holders.\nThe U.S. Cellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, so long as not less than 500,000 Series A Common Shares are outstanding, U.S. Cellular, without the written consent of TDS, shall not, directly or indirectly own, invest or otherwise have an interest in, lease, operate or manage any business other than a business engaged solely in the construction of, the ownership of interests in and/or the management of wireless telephone systems. This limitation on the scope of U.S. Cellular\u2019s potential business could hurt the growth of U.S. Cellular\u2019s business. This restriction would preclude U.S. Cellular from pursuing attractive related or unrelated business opportunities unless TDS consents in writing. TDS has no obligation to consent to any business opportunities proposed by U.S. Cellular and may withhold its consent in its own best interests.\n32) Certain matters, such as control by TDS and provisions in the U.S. Cellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation, may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of U.S. Cellular.\nThe control of U.S. Cellular by TDS may tend to deter non-negotiated tender offers or other efforts to obtain control of U.S. Cellular and thereby deprive shareholders of opportunities to sell shares at prices higher than those prevailing in the market.\nThe U.S. Cellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation also contains provisions which may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of U.S. Cellular without the support of TDS or without meeting various other conditions. In particular, the authorization of multiple classes of capital stock with different voting rights could prevent shareholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change in control of U.S. Cellular by delaying or preventing such change in control.\nThe U.S. Cellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation also authorizes the U.S. Cellular Board of Directors to designate and issue Preferred Shares in one or more classes or series from time to time. Generally, no further action or authorization by the shareholders is necessary prior to the designation or issuance of the additional Preferred Shares authorized pursuant to the U.S. Cellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless applicable laws or regulations would require such approval in a given instance. Such Preferred Shares could be issued in circumstances that would serve to preserve TDS\u2019 control of U.S. Cellular.\n33) Any of the foregoing events or other events could cause revenues, earnings, capital expenditures and/or any other financial or statistical information to vary from U.S. Cellular\u2019s forward-looking estimates by a material amount.\nFrom time to time, U.S. Cellular may disclose forward-looking information, including estimates of future service revenues; various measures of income before income taxes; and/or capital expenditures. Any such forward-looking information includes consideration\nof known or anticipated changes to the extent disclosed, but dynamic market conditions and/or other unknown or unanticipated events, including but not limited to the risks discussed above, could cause such estimates to differ materially from the actual amounts.", "PERMNO": 75320, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "USM"}
