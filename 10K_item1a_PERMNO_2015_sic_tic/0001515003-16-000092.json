The risks and uncertainties described below are not intended to be exhaustive but represent the risks that we believe are material. If any of the following risks, and other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which we currently deem immaterial, actually occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition would likely suffer and could materially and adversely affect the prices of our securities.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nA significant portion of our sales is, and is expected to continue to be, from contracts with the U.S. Government, and any significant reduction in the U.S. defense budget or any disruption or decline in U.S. Government expenditures could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nApproximately 42%, 40% and 42% of our sales in our 2016, 2015 and 2014 fiscal years, respectively, were made to the U.S. Government, either directly or indirectly through prime contractors or subcontractors. Because our U.S. Government contracts are dependent on the U.S. defense budget, any significant disruption or decline in U.S. Government defense expenditures in the future, changes in U.S. Government spending priorities, other legislative changes or changes in our relationship with the U.S. Government could result in the loss of some or all of our government contracts, which, in turn, could result in a decrease in our sales and cash flow.\nIn addition, U.S. Government contracts are also conditioned upon continuing Congressional approval and the appropriation of necessary funds. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program each fiscal year even though contract periods of performance may exceed one year. Consequently, at the outset of a major program, multi-year contracts are usually funded for only the first year, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as Congress makes appropriations for future fiscal years. We cannot ensure that any of our government contracts will continue to be funded from year to year. If such contracts are not funded, our sales may decline, which could negatively affect our results of operations and result in decreased cash flows.\n- 17 -\nWe are subject to risks particular to companies supplying defense-related equipment and services to the U.S. Government. The realization of any of these risks could cause a loss of or decline in our sales to the U.S. Government.\nU.S. Government contracts contain termination provisions and are subject to audit and modification.\nThe U.S. Government has the ability to:\n\u2022\nterminate existing contracts, including for the convenience of the government or because of a default in our performance of the contract;\n\u2022\nreduce the value of existing contracts;\n\u2022\nchange the terms of performance of existing contracts;\n\u2022\ncancel multi-year contracts or programs;\n\u2022\naudit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations or other laws that apply to the performance of government contracts; and\n\u2022\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of our products, services, technology or other data.\nEach of our U.S. Government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. Government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. If such contracts are terminated or reduced in scope, our sales may decline, which would negatively affect our results of operations and result in decreased cash flow. Termination-for-convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination-for-default provisions may provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Our contracts with foreign governments generally contain similar provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the customer.\nThe U.S. Government may review or audit our direct and indirect costs and performance on certain contracts, as well as our accounting and general business practices, for compliance with complex statutes and regulations, including the Truth in Negotiations Act, Federal Acquisition Regulations, Cost Accounting Standards and other administrative regulations. The U.S. Government audits our costs and performance on a continual basis, and we have outstanding audits like most government contractors. Based on the results of these audits, the U.S. Government may reduce our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. In addition, under U.S. Government regulations, some of our costs, including certain financing costs, research and development costs and marketing expenses, may not be reimbursable under U.S. Government contracts.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations related to our U.S. Government contracts business which may impose additional costs on our business.\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations related to our performance of our government contracts and our business. These laws and regulations may impose additional costs on our business. In addition, we are subject to audits, reviews and investigations of our compliance with these laws and regulations. In the event that we are found to have failed to comply with these laws and regulations, we may be fined, we may not be reimbursed for costs incurred in performing the contracts, our contracts may be terminated and we may be unable to obtain new contracts. If a government review, audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including forfeiture of claims and profits, suspension of payments, statutory penalties, damages related to the illegal activity, fines and suspension or debarment from government contracts.\n- 18 -\nIn addition, many of our U.S. Government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances, and we are required to maintain certain facility clearances. Complex regulations and requirements apply to obtaining and maintaining personnel and facility security clearances, and obtaining such clearances can be a lengthy process. To the extent we are not able to obtain or maintain personnel or facility security clearances, we also may not be able to seek or perform future classified contracts. If we are unable to do any of the foregoing, we will not be able to maintain or grow our business, and our revenue may decline.\nAs a result of our U.S. Government business, we may be subject to false claim suits, and a judgment against us in any of these suits could cause us to be liable for substantial damages.\nOur business with the U.S. Government, subjects us to \u201cqui tam,\u201d or \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d suits brought by private plaintiffs in the name of the U.S. Government upon the allegation that we submitted a false claim to the U.S. Government, as well as to false claim suits brought by the U.S. Government. A judgment against us in a qui tam or false claim suit could cause us to be liable for substantial damages (including treble damages and monetary penalties) and could carry penalties of suspension or debarment, which would make us ineligible to receive any U.S. Government contracts for a period of up to three years. Any material judgment, or any suspension or debarment, could result in increased costs and a loss of revenue, which could negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, any of the foregoing could cause a loss of customer confidence and could negatively harm our business and our future prospects.\nSome of our sole-provider business from the U.S. Government in the future may be subject to competitive bidding.\nSome of the business that we will seek from the U.S. Government in the future may be awarded through a competitive bidding process. The competitive bidding process may reduce the price at which we sell our products to the U.S. Government and reduce our net income. Competitive bidding on government contracts presents risks, such as:\n\u2022\nthe need to bid on programs in advance of contract performance, which may result in unforeseen performance issues and costs; and\n\u2022\nthe expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge the award made to us, which could result in a reprocurement, modified contract, or reduced work.\nIf we fail to win competitively bid contracts or fail to perform under these contracts in a profitable manner, our sales and results of operations could suffer.\nWe generate sales from contracts with foreign governments, and significant changes in government policies or to appropriations of those governments could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe estimate that approximately 11%, 13% and 8% of our sales in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were made directly or indirectly to foreign governments. Significant changes to appropriations or national defense policies, disruptions of our relationships with foreign governments or terminations of our foreign government contracts could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our contracts with foreign governments also subject us to U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act (which also reaches commercial bribery). A judgment or settlement under the provisions of these laws could subject us to substantial monetary penalties and damages, as well as suspension and/or debarment. Suspension or debarment could deny us the ability to retain or obtain U.S. Government contracts or restrict our exporting activity. In addition, any material judgment in this area could result in increased costs, which could negatively affect our results of operations, and could cause a loss of customer confidence, thus adversely affecting our business and future prospects.\n- 19 -\nWe face competition in the markets in which we sell our products.\nThe U.S. and foreign markets in which we sell our products are competitive. Our ability to compete in these markets depends on our ability to provide high-quality products with short lead times at competitive prices, as well our ability to create innovative new products. In addition, our competitors could introduce new products with greater capabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain of our competitors are owned by companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Also, our foreign competitors may not be subject to U.S. Government export restrictions and may benefit from more favorable currency rates, which may make it easier in certain circumstances for them to sell to foreign customers. If we are unable to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, our business and sales will be harmed.\nThe end markets in which we operate are subject to technological change, and changes in technology could adversely affect our sales.\nOur defense and commercial end markets are subject to technological change. Advances in existing technology, or the development of new technology, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Historically, we have relied on a combination of internal research and development and customer-funded research and development activities. To succeed in the future, we must continually engage in effective and timely research and development efforts in order to introduce innovative new products for technologically sophisticated customers and end markets and to benefit from the activities of our customers. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or fail to obtain access to important technologies, our sales could suffer.\nWe may not be successful in implementing part of our growth strategy if we are unable to identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets or integrate acquired companies successfully, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFinding and consummating acquisitions is one of the components of our growth strategy. In furtherance of this strategy, we acquired ASC Signal (September 2015) and Radant (October 2013), and we intend to continue to seek to make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies.\nIn order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete these transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and integrate acquired companies. Integration and other risks of acquisitions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple acquisitions are pursued simultaneously. If we fail to identify and complete acquisitions, we may be required to expend resources to internally develop products and technology, may be at a competitive disadvantage or may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to grow by acquisition depends on the availability of acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and our ability to obtain additional acquisition financing on acceptable terms. In making acquisitions, we may experience competition from larger companies with significantly greater resources. We are likely to use significant amounts of cash and/or incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds to carry out acquisitions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, acquisitions could cause or result in the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, technologies and products acquired;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nour operating and financial systems and controls being inadequate to deal with our growth; and\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees.\nAcquisitions may require us to integrate different company cultures, management teams and business infrastructures and otherwise manage integration risks. Even if an acquisition is successfully integrated, we may not receive the expected benefits of the transaction. The integration of acquisitions may make the completion and integration of subsequent acquisitions more difficult.\n- 20 -\nManaging acquisitions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert management\u2019s attention from our other business operations. Acquisitions, including abandoned acquisitions, also may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings.\nAcquisitions may also provide us with challenges in implementing the required processes, procedures and controls in our acquired operations. Acquired companies may not have disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as those required by securities laws in the U.S.\nGoodwill and other intangibles resulting from our acquisitions could become impaired.\nAs of September 30, 2016, our goodwill, developed and core technology and other intangibles amounted to $463.8 million, net of accumulated amortization. We expect to amortize developed and core technology and other definitely-lived intangibles by approximately $11.7 million in each of fiscal years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, $11.0 million in fiscal year 2021 and $154.5 million in the aggregate thereafter. The remaining balance of our intangibles relate to the non-amortizable goodwill and indefinitely-lived tradenames. To the extent we do not generate sufficient cash flows to recover the net amount of any investment in goodwill and other intangibles recorded, the investment could be considered impaired and subject to a non-cash write off. We expect to record further goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of any future acquisitions. Future amortization of such other intangible assets or impairments, if any, of goodwill would adversely affect our results of operations in any given period.\nOur international operations subject us to the social, political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our business, employ a substantial number of employees and use external sales organizations in Canada and in other countries outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to certain risks of doing business internationally. Direct sales to customers located outside the U.S. were approximately 33%, 34% and 33% in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition include the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in currency rates with respect to the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign government policies;\n\u2022\ncurrency restrictions, which may prevent the transfer of capital and profits to the U.S.;\n\u2022\nrestrictions imposed by the U.S. Government on the export of certain products and technology;\n\u2022\nthe responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nthe impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical developments and conditions, including international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, trade relationships and military and political alliances.\nLimitations on imports, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our international operations, including the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to declare dividends or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries to pay interest and principal on our debt.\n- 21 -\nWe are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations.\nA portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In particular, we incur significant expenses in Canadian dollars in connection with our Canadian operations, but do not receive significant revenues in Canadian dollars. Changes in exchange rates among certain currencies, such as the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar, will affect our cost of sales, operating margins and revenues. Specifically, if the Canadian dollar strengthens relative to the U.S. dollar, our expenses will increase, and our results of operations will suffer. We use financial instruments, primarily Canadian dollar forward contracts, to hedge a portion of the Canadian dollar-denominated costs for our manufacturing operation in Canada. If these hedging activities are not successful or we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future, we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, changes in exchange rates that result in the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain currencies may impact our ability to offer competitively priced products to foreign customers.\nLaws and regulations governing the export of our products could adversely impact our business.\nLicenses or other authorizations are required from U.S. Government agencies for the export of many of our products in accordance with various regulations, including the United States Export Administration Regulations (for commercial products, including \u201cdual use\u201d products with military applications) administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (for defense articles and defense services) administered by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the U.S. Department of State. Under these regulations, a license or other authorization may be required before transferring certain export-controlled articles or technical data, or providing defense services, to foreign persons, whether in the U.S. or abroad; before exporting certain of our products, services, and technical data outside the U.S.; before engaging in brokering activities involving export-controlled defense articles; and for the temporary import of certain defense articles and technical data. In addition, regulations administered by the OFAC of the U.S. Department of the Treasury govern transactions with countries and persons subject to U.S. trade sanctions, including import as well as export transactions. We are also subject to U.S. Government restrictions on transactions with specific entities and individuals, including, without limitation, those set forth on the Entity List, the Specially Designated Nationals List, the Denied Persons List, the Unverified List, and the U.S. State Department\u2019s lists of debarred parties. We are also subject to U.S. customs laws and regulations, including customs duties, when applicable. Additionally, we are subject to the Anti-Boycott Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Antiboycott Compliance (\u201cOAC\u201d) and the Boycott Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 999) administered by the Internal Revenue Service. These laws and regulations could materially adversely impact our sales and business in the following scenarios:\n\u2022\nIn order to obtain the license for the sale of such a product, we are required to obtain information from the potential customer and provide it to the U.S. Government. If the U.S. Government determines that the sale presents national security risks or is otherwise contrary to U.S. policy, it may not approve the sale.\n\u2022\nDelays caused by the requirement to obtain a required license or other authorization may cause delays in our production, sales and export activities, and may cause us to lose potential sales.\n\u2022\nIf we violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines or penalties, including debarment as an exporter and/or debarment or suspension as a government contractor.\nIn addition to U.S. laws and regulations, foreign countries may also have laws and regulations governing imports and exports.\n- 22 -\nEnvironmental and zoning laws and regulations and other obligations relating to environmental matters could subject us to liability for fines, clean-ups and other damages, require us to incur significant costs to modify our operations and/or increase our manufacturing costs.\nEnvironmental and zoning laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate as we are currently operating and could result in additional costs.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local, as well as foreign, environmental and zoning laws and regulations relating, among other things, to wastewater discharge, air emissions, storage and handling of hazardous materials, disposal of hazardous and other wastes and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. We use a number of chemicals or similar substances and generate wastes that are classified as hazardous. We require permits to conduct many of our operations. Violations of environmental and zoning laws and regulations could result in substantial fines, penalties and other sanctions. Changes in environmental and zoning laws or regulations (or in their enforcement) affecting or limiting, for example, our chemical uses and storage, certain of our manufacturing processes or our disposal practices, could restrict our ability to operate as we are currently operating or could impose additional costs. The City of Palo Alto, in March 2016, adopted zoning changes which prohibit the use of certain hazardous chemicals above set quantities within 300 feet of residential homes. We currently use some of the stated hazardous chemicals above the set quantities within 300 feet of residential homes as part of our manufacturing operations at our Palo Alto facilities. The City of Palo Alto also adopted a schedule by which we must bring our Palo Alto facilities into conformance with the new law. To be in conformance, we must reduce the use of the stated hazardous chemicals below the set quantities or relocate the use to a distance greater than 300 feet from the residential homes. We have until December 31, 2026, to relocate to a distance greater than 300 feet, or until December 31, 2031, if we elect to terminate the non-conforming use of hazardous chemicals. Although we have a number of years to comply, the possible relocation of those operations could significantly increase our operating costs, could result in delays in our manufacturing process and, therefore, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may experience releases of regulated materials or discover existing contamination, which could cause us to incur material cleanup costs or other damages. Some environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and remediation of contaminated sites on current and former owners and operators of those sites, and also impose liability for related damages to natural resources. In addition, owners and operators of contaminated sites may be subject to claims for damage to property or personal injury alleged to result from the contamination. In 2010, ASC Signal became aware of volatile organic compound and other contamination in the soil and groundwater at the Whitby, Ontario industrial site. We believe that the contamination originated from the neighboring property which reportedly is used for crystal manufacturing and secondarily from the operational practices of the prior operators of ASC Signal. We have addressed these conditions through the implementation of a remediation plan. ASC Signal holds a pair of pollution insurance policies and the insurer is indemnifying ASC Signal for the remediation costs. We expect that the total remediation costs will be less than the insurance policy limits. In addition, ASC Signal has filed civil actions against the neighbor and certain other parties to recover certain consequential damages resulting from the contamination. We have been informed that one of the defendants in this lawsuit has filed for bankruptcy. Although we have accrued reasonably estimable costs associated with remediation at the Whitby site, the estimate of costs and their timing could change as a result of a number of factors, including (i) input from applicable regulatory agencies on the our remediation plan and any changes which they may subsequently require,(ii) refinement of cost estimates and length of time required to complete remediation and post-remediation operations and maintenance, (iii) changes in technology and information related to the affected site, and (iv) unforeseen circumstances existing at the site. As a result of these factors, the actual amount of costs we will incur in connection with the said remediation could exceed the amount accrued at this time. Additional environmental liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n- 23 -\nWe could be subject to significant environmental liabilities related to our business.\nWhen we purchased our electron devices business in 1995, a number of the facilities of the business were subject to environmental contamination and remediation. In connection with the sale, Varian Medical Systems generally agreed to indemnify us for various environmental liabilities relating to the business prior to the purchase. This indemnification is subject to certain exceptions and limitations, including exceptions and limitations arising from later agreements with Varian Medical Systems. Varian Medical Systems is undertaking the environmental investigation and remedial work at the manufacturing facilities that are known to require environmental remediation. In addition, Varian Medical Systems has been sued or threatened with suit with respect to environmental obligations related to certain of these manufacturing facilities. If Varian Medical Systems does not comply fully with its indemnification obligations to us or does not continue to have the financial resources to comply fully with those obligations, or if environmental issues arise that are not subject to the Varian Medical Systems\u2019 indemnification, we could be subject to significant liabilities.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we have environmental loss reserves totaling $1.6 million for remaining potential remediation costs related to VOC and other contamination in our ASC Signal division's Whitby, Ontario industrial site. The calculation of environmental loss reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information. Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the amount of reserves given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to the affected site. ASC Signal\u2019s insurer has an obligation to indemnify ASC Signal for the estimated liabilities. If ASC Signal\u2019s insurer is unable or unwilling to honor its indemnity obligation, we would seek to enforce our legal rights, including the enforcement of the indemnity obligation and redress from all parties at fault, including certain third parties against whom ASC Signal has filed civil actions. If both insurance and indemnity protection were unavailable or insufficient, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nWe believe that we have been and are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we do not expect to incur material costs relating to environmental compliance. However, new environmental requirements, changes in enforcement of existing environmental requirements, or discovery of previously unknown conditions, could result in additional costs that may be significant.\nOur inability to obtain certain necessary raw materials and key components could disrupt the manufacture of our products and cause our sales and results of operations to suffer.\nWe obtain certain raw materials and key components necessary for the manufacture of our products, such as molybdenum, cupronickel, OFHC copper, quartz cloth and some cathodes, from a limited group of, or occasionally sole, suppliers. We have long-standing business relationships with our key suppliers and many of our critical commodities are covered by long-term blanket agreements. If any of our suppliers fails to meet our needs, we may not have readily available alternatives. Delays in component deliveries could cause delays in product shipments and require the redesign of certain products. If we are unable to obtain necessary raw materials and key components from our suppliers under favorable purchase terms and/or on a timely basis or to develop alternative sources, our ability to manufacture products could be disrupted or delayed, and our sales and results of operations could suffer.\nIf we are unable to retain key management and other personnel, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business and future performance depends on the continued contributions of key management personnel. Our current management team has an average of more than 30 years experience with us (and our predecessors) in various capacities. Since assuming their current leadership roles in 2002, this team has increased our sales, reduced our costs and grown our business. The unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. In addition, some of our technical personnel, such as our key engineers, could be difficult to replace.\n- 24 -\nOur business and operating results could be adversely affected by losses under fixed-price contracts.\nMost of our governmental and commercial contracts are fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts require us to perform all work under the contract for a specified lump-sum price. Fixed-price contracts expose us to a number of risks, including underestimation of costs, ambiguities in specifications, unforeseen costs or difficulties, problems with new technologies, delays beyond our control, failure of subcontractors to perform and economic or other changes that may occur during the contract period. In addition, some of our fixed-price contracts contain termination provisions that permit our customer to terminate the contract if we are unsuccessful in fulfilling our obligations under the contract. In that event, we could be liable for the excess costs incurred by our customer in completing the contract.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other violations of our intellectual property, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or to take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, we cannot be certain that our processes and products do not or will not infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights could cause us to incur significant costs, prevent us from selling our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVeritas Capital controls us and may have conflicts of interest with us or holders of our debt in the future.\nVeritas Capital indirectly beneficially owns substantially all of our outstanding voting shares. As a result of this ownership, Veritas Capital is entitled to elect all or substantially all of our directors, to appoint new management and to approve actions requiring the approval of our stockholder, including approving or rejecting proposed mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets, regardless of whether holders of our debt believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests.\nThe interests of Veritas Capital may differ from those of the holders of our debt in material respects. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of the equity holders might conflict with the interests of the holders of our debt. Veritas Capital also may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings (including financings that are secured) or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to holders of our debt. Additionally, the indenture governing our notes permits us to pay management advisory fees, dividends or make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and Veritas Capital may have an interest in our doing so.\nVeritas Capital is in the business of making investments in companies, and owns, or may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in businesses or provide advice that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. Veritas Capital may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. See \u201cSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\u201d and \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nOur backlog is subject to modifications and terminations of orders, which could negatively impact our sales.\nBacklog represents firm orders for which goods and services are yet to be provided, including with respect to government contracts that are cancelable at will. As of September 30, 2016, we had an order backlog of $326.2 million. Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared to our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify these orders. Cancellations of purchase orders or reductions of product quantities in existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales. Our failure to replace canceled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\n- 25 -\nWe have experienced and expect to experience fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe have experienced, and in the future expect to experience, fluctuations in our operating results, including net orders and sales. The timing of customers\u2019 order placement and customers\u2019 willingness to commit to purchase products at any particular time are inherently difficult to predict or forecast. Once orders are received, factors that may affect whether these orders become sales and translate into revenues in a particular quarter include:\n\u2022\ndelay in shipments due to various factors, including cancellations by a customer, delays in a customer\u2019s own production schedules, natural disasters or manufacturing difficulties;\n\u2022\ndelay in a customer\u2019s acceptance of a product; or\n\u2022\na change in a customer\u2019s financial condition or ability to obtain financing.\nOur operating results may also be affected by a number of other factors, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the geographical markets that we serve;\n\u2022\nreduction in the U.S. defense budget or any disruption or decline in U.S. Government expenditures;\n\u2022\nsensitivity to rapid technological innovation and obsolescence of existing products;\n\u2022\nchanges or anticipated changes in third-party reimbursement amounts or policies applicable to treatments using our products;\n\u2022\nrevenues becoming affected by seasonal influences;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the relative portion of our revenues represented by our various products;\n\u2022\ntiming of the announcement, introduction and delivery of new products or product enhancements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the supply or changes in the costs of raw materials, labor, product components or transportation services;\n\u2022\nthe impact of changing levels of sales to sole purchasers of certain of our products; and\n\u2022\nthe unfavorable outcome of any litigation.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;\n- 26 -\n\u2022\nchanges in available tax credits, including foreign tax credits;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and/or\n\u2022\nthe repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.\nAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber security threats and other security threats and disruptions.\nWe face various cyber security threats, including cyber security attacks to our IT infrastructure and attempts to gain access to proprietary or classified information and threats to physical security. Cybersecurity threats in particular are persistent, evolve quickly and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, attempts to access information, denial of service and other electronic security breaches. Our IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. Although we have invested in highly skilled IT resources and utilized various procedures and controls to monitor threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent cyber security threats from materializing. If any of these threats were to materialize, they could:\n\u2022\ndisrupt the proper functioning of our IT networks, data center facilities and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers;\n\u2022\nresult in unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u2022\ncompromise national security and other sensitive government functions;\n\u2022\nrequire significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; and\n\u2022\nresult in legal claims or proceedings against us and damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. government) and the public generally.\nAs a contractor supporting national security customers, we are also subject to regulatory compliance requirements under the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and other federal regulations requiring that our networks and IT systems comply with the security and privacy controls in National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-171. We must comply with the security control requirements by a certain deadline. We may also be responsible if our suppliers do not comply with these requirements. Our or our suppliers' failure to comply with the requirements could result in cancellation of our existing government contracts and our ineligibility to bid for certain agency contracts in the future, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, the cost of remediating gaps in our security posture and continually defending against cyber-attacks and breaches has increased in recent years and future costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\n- 27 -\nCompliance with new regulations and customer demands regarding \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could significantly increase costs and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.\nIn August 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u201cthe Dodd-Frank Act\u201d), the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals (referred to as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d regardless of their actual country of origin) in their products. Some of these metals, such as gold, tantalum, tin and tungsten, are commonly used in electronic equipment and devices, including our products. These requirements require companies to annually investigate, disclose and report whether or not such metals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We are required to file our own report with the SEC regarding the sourcing of minerals used in our products. In addition, many of our customers require that we provide sourcing information to them to enable them to comply with their own reporting obligations. Our first three reports were filed with the SEC on June 2, 2014, May 29, 2015 and May 31, 2016 for the 2013, 2014 and 2015 calendar years, respectively. Complying with these rules requires investigative efforts and cooperation and assistance from our suppliers, which have caused, and will continue to cause, us to incur associated costs and could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products, or result in process or manufacturing modifications, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nThe term loans under our first and second lien credit facilities will become due in November 2017 unless we can refinance at least 65% of our outstanding senior notes and satisfy certain other conditions. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of September 30, 2016, excluding approximately $4.5 million of undrawn letters of credit, our total indebtedness was $545.3 million before unamortized original issue discount of $2.6 million and debt issuance costs of $8.2 million, including our outstanding senior notes and borrowings under our first and second lien credit facilities. We also had an additional $25.5 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility included in our first lien credit facility. Unless certain terms and conditions in our first and second lien credit agreements are met, including having no less than 65% of our outstanding senior notes repaid or refinanced on or prior to November 17, 2017, the term loans under our first and second lien credit facilities will become due and payable in November 2017.\nOn December 12, 2016, we entered into a commitment letter (the \u201cCommitment Letter\u201d) with UBS AG, Stamford Branch and UBS Securities LLC (collectively, \u201cUBS\u201d), pursuant to which UBS has committed (subject to certain customary conditions) to provide and arrange a bridge loan facility of $245 million (\u201cBridge Facility\u201d) to refinance 100% of our existing senior notes (if we are otherwise unable to refinance our senior notes with certain other financing) and 100% of our second lien credit facility. The Commitment Letter expires on April 12, 2017. If we are unable to refinance at least 65% of our outstanding senior notes and satisfy certain other conditions prior to November 17, 2017, we will be unable to meet our repayment obligations when the term loans under our first and second lien credit facilities mature, which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our outstanding senior notes and senior secured credit facility.\nOur high degree of leverage could have important consequences for the holders of our debt, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, will be at variable rates of interest;\n- 28 -\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing our senior notes due 2018 and the agreements governing such other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nOur cash interest expense for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $34.6 million, $32.3 million and $28.3 million, respectively. At September 30, 2016, we had $330.3 million aggregate principal amount of variable interest rate indebtedness under our term loan facilities.\nDespite the high level of our indebtedness, which includes our senior notes, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes and senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition to the $25.5 million that was available to us as of September 30, 2016 for borrowing under our revolving credit facility, we may request, through an incremental facility and subject to certain conditions, additional commitments under our first lien term loan facility of up to $75.0 million plus the aggregate amount of first lien term loan repayments and revolving commitment reductions (subject to certain exceptions), and additional commitments under our second term loan facility of up to $10.0 million plus the aggregate amount of all prepayments of the second lien term loan made prior to or simultaneously with the incurrence of new incremental commitments (subject to certain exceptions), plus an unlimited amount at any time so long as, after giving effect to such additional commitments, certain specified leverage ratios are not exceeded. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face will increase. In addition, the indenture governing our outstanding notes would not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness.\nBased on our current level of operations, we believe that our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months, barring any unforeseen circumstances that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, the indenture governing our notes allows us to make significant restricted payments and other dividends. The making of such restricted payments or other dividend payments could affect our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including our notes, on or before the stated maturity of such indebtedness, such as the current case with our existing senior notes, at least 65% of which we plan to refinance prior to November 17, 2017 in order to extend the maturity of the term loans under our first and second lien credit facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facilities and outstanding notes, on commercially reasonable terms, on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n- 29 -\nOur outstanding senior notes and the guarantees are unsecured and effectively subordinated to our and each guarantor\u2019s existing and future secured indebtedness.\nOur outstanding notes and guarantees are not secured by any of our or the guarantors\u2019 assets. The indenture governing these notes permits us and the guarantors to incur secured debt, including pursuant to our senior secured credit facilities and other forms of secured debt. As a result, these notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of our and each guarantor\u2019s secured obligations to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations. If we or the guarantors were to become insolvent or otherwise fail to make payment on our outstanding senior notes or the guarantees, holders of any of our and each guarantor\u2019s secured obligations would be paid first and would receive payments from the assets securing such obligations before the holders of our notes would receive any payments. The noteholders may therefore not be fully repaid if we or the guarantors become insolvent or otherwise fail to make payment on our senior notes.\nClaims of noteholders are structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee our outstanding notes.\nClaims of holders of our outstanding notes are structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes, including trade creditors. All obligations of these subsidiaries will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise, to us or creditors of us, including the holders of our outstanding notes. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $192.5 million, or 39%, of our net sales for fiscal year 2016, and approximately $249.5 million, or 35%, of our total assets (net of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash) as of September 30, 2016. Amounts are presented after giving effect to intercompany eliminations.\nOur ability to repay our indebtedness, including our outstanding senior notes, is dependent on the cash flow generated by our operating subsidiaries.\nOur operating subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and conduct all of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including our outstanding notes, will be dependent on the generation of cash flow by the operating subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to CPII, directly or indirectly, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. The operating subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable CPII to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the senior notes. Each operating subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit CPII\u2019s ability to obtain cash from the operating subsidiaries. While the indenture governing our notes limits the ability of the operating subsidiaries to incur consensual encumbrances or restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, those limitations are subject to waiver and certain qualifications and exceptions.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue equity interests;\n\u2022\nsell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\npay dividends or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and loans;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with our affiliates;\n- 30 -\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\namend or waive provisions of charter documents in a manner materially adverse to the lenders.\nThese covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from our lenders, our debt under these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. Because of cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other indebtedness. In addition, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our outstanding notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nThe lenders under our senior secured credit facilities have the discretion to release any subsidiary guarantor under our senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances, which would cause those subsidiary guarantors to be released from their guarantees of our outstanding notes.\nWhile any obligations under our senior secured credit facilities remain outstanding, any subsidiary guarantee of our outstanding notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of our senior notes or the trustee under the indenture governing the senior notes, at the discretion of lenders under the senior secured credit facilities, if the related subsidiary guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under our senior secured credit facilities or any other indebtedness. The lenders under our senior secured credit facilities would have the discretion to release the subsidiary guarantees under our senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances. Any holder of our notes will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the senior notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of noteholders.\nThe Parent\u2019s guarantee of our outstanding notes may not provide any additional credit support for our senior notes.\nSince the Parent has no significant operations or assets, its guarantee of our senior notes provides little, if any, additional credit support for the senior notes and investors should not rely on this guarantee in evaluating an investment in the senior notes. The indenture permits the Parent to be released from its guarantee of the senior notes at any time without the consent of any holder of the senior notes.\nFederal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void the guarantees and require noteholders to return payments received from guarantors.\nUnder federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a guarantee could be deemed a fraudulent transfer if the guarantor received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for giving the guarantee and\n\u2022\nwas insolvent on the date that it gave the guarantee or became insolvent as a result of giving the guarantee, or\n\u2022\nwas engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a transaction, for which property remaining with the guarantor was an unreasonably small capital, or\n\u2022\nintended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts that would be beyond the guarantor\u2019s ability to pay as those debts matured.\nA guarantee could also be deemed a fraudulent transfer if it was given with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any entity to which the guarantor was or became, on or after the date the guarantee was given, indebted.\n- 31 -\nThe measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if:\n\u2022\nthe sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than all its assets, at a fair valuation, or\n\u2022\nthe present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature, or\n\u2022\nit could not pay its debts as they become due.\nThe indenture contains a \u201csavings\u201d provision intended to limit each subsidiary guarantor\u2019s liability under its guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the subsidiary guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law. There can be no assurance that this provision will be upheld as intended. In a recent case, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida found the \u201csavings\u201d provision in that case to be ineffective, and held the subsidiary guarantees to be fraudulent transfers and voided them in their entirety.\nIf a guarantee is deemed to be a fraudulent transfer, it could be voided altogether, or it could be subordinated to all other debts of the guarantor. In such case, any payment by the guarantor pursuant to its guarantee could be required to be returned to the guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the guarantor. If a guarantee is voided or held unenforceable for any other reason, holders of our outstanding notes would cease to have a claim against the subsidiary based on the guarantee and would be creditors only of CPII and any guarantor whose guarantee was not similarly voided or otherwise held unenforceable.\nWe may not have the ability to raise funds necessary to finance any change of control offer required under the indenture.\nIf a change of control (as defined in the indenture) occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase our outstanding notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a purchase offer obligation arises under the indenture governing our senior notes, a change of control could also occur under our new senior secured credit facilities, which could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness outstanding thereunder. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions and provisions. If a purchase offer were required under the indenture for our debt, we may not have sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of all debt, including our outstanding notes, that we are required to purchase or repay.", "PERMNO": 91172, "SIC": 3669, "TIC": "5929B"}
