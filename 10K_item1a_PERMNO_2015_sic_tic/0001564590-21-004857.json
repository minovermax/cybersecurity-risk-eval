RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If they do, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected. In such an instance, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.\nOur results of operations have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity are expected to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and that impact may be material.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant volatility in the global economy and led to a dramatic reduction in economic activity worldwide. International, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities have taken extraordinary actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 throughout most regions of the world, including travel bans, quarantines, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders and similar mandates that have caused many individuals to substantially restrict their daily activities and many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations.\nThe tire industry has been negatively impacted by this evolving situation, particularly earlier in 2020, which was characterized by a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspending or severely limiting automobile production globally. Our results have been, and are likely to continue to be, adversely impacted by this economic disruption, including lower tire volume, sales, income and cash flow. In addition, our ability to continue implementing important strategic initiatives and capital expenditures may be reduced as we devote time and other resources to\nresponding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn March 2020, we announced the suspension of production at our manufacturing facilities in Europe and the Americas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production was suspended or significantly limited at most of our manufacturing facilities around the world during parts of the first half of 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, we completed a phased restart of most of our manufacturing facilities. Most of our factories returned to full capacity by the end of the third quarter and remained at full capacity during the fourth quarter. Our decisions to change production levels in the future will be based on an evaluation of market demand signals, inventory and supply levels, as well as our ability to continue to safeguard the health of our associates. During 2021, we may experience unexpected delays or obstacles, such as disruptions in our supply chain or government mandates, that may hamper our ability to achieve planned production levels. Further, we will not be able to operate at optimal levels of efficiency given new work rules and procedures that were implemented to protect our associates and increased absenteeism as a result of community spread of COVID-19. Any suspension of production at our manufacturing facilities, or difficulties or inefficiencies in resuming or increasing production, is likely to adversely impact our future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and that impact may be material.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities. Our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period of time or worsens, our liquidity position may deteriorate. While we actively monitor our liquidity and took a number of actions aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flows and liquidity, our cash flows from operating activities may decline if global economic activity remains low and we are unable to have sufficient access to credit or other capital. For example, the borrowing base under our first lien revolving credit facility is dependent, in significant part, on our eligible accounts receivable and inventory, which have declined as a result of our lower sales and production levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our European revolving credit facility contains a leverage ratio covenant applicable to Goodyear Europe B.V. and its subsidiaries. While we are currently in compliance with this covenant, if we were unable to satisfy this covenant in the future or obtain a waiver from our lenders, we would no longer be able to access our \u20ac800 million European revolving credit facility or our pan-European accounts receivable securitization facility.\nThe full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments, such as the ultimate duration and scope of the pandemic, its impact on our customers and suppliers, how quickly normal economic conditions, operations and the demand for our products can resume, and whether the pandemic leads to recessionary conditions in any of our key markets. Government-sponsored liquidity or stimulus programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may not be available to us or our customers or suppliers, and if available, may be insufficient to address\nthe full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity cannot be determined at this time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated several of the risks disclosed below, including, but not limited to, the following (which are identified by their caption):\n\u2022\nIf we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nOur long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.\n\u2022\nFinancial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.\n\u2022\nOur capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.\n\u2022\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.\n\u2022\nAny failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.\n\u2022\nWe have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.\nIf we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.\nOur results for 2020 were highly influenced by the severe economic disruption caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The tire industry has been negatively impacted by this evolving situation, particularly earlier in the year, which was characterized by a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspending or severely limiting automobile production globally. Our results have been, and are likely to continue to be, adversely impacted by this economic disruption, including lower tire volume, sales, income and cash flow. In this environment, global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.\nWe are pursuing important strategic initiatives, such as our operational excellence, sales and marketing excellence and innovation excellence initiatives. Our operational excellence initiatives are aimed at improving our manufacturing efficiency and creating an advantaged supply chain focused on reducing our total delivered costs, optimizing working capital levels and delivering best in industry customer service. Our sales and marketing excellence initiatives are intended to build the value of our brand, help our customers win in their markets, and become consumers' preferred choice. Our innovation excellence initiatives are designed to develop great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers. If we fail to execute these initiatives successfully, we may fail to achieve our financial goals.\nWe believe that our manufacturing footprint is less cost-competitive than that of our principal competitors. To begin to address this competitive disadvantage, we are curtailing production of tires for declining, less profitable segments of the tire market and undertaking significant capital investments in building, expanding and modernizing manufacturing facilities around the world to strengthen the competitiveness of our manufacturing footprint and increase production of premium, large-rim diameter consumer tires. The failure to implement successfully this or our other important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe continue to face distribution challenges in Europe which have adversely impacted our consumer replacement tire business in that region. In 2020, we continued to address these challenges by taking actions to better align our European distribution network in order to capture the full value of our products and brands in the marketplace. This project is ongoing and although significant progress has been made, the remaining changes we are pursuing to our distribution network in Europe could lead to continued disruption in our consumer replacement sales in 2021. If we fail to address the distribution challenges that we face, or our plans to align our distribution network in Europe do not achieve the desired result, our competitive position may deteriorate and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur performance is also dependent on our ability to improve the volume and mix of higher margin tires we sell in our targeted market segments. In order to do so, we must be successful in developing, producing, marketing and selling products that consumers desire and that offer higher margins to us. Shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could\nmaterially adversely affect our business. We have been capacity constrained from time to time with respect to the production of certain higher margin tires, particularly in the United States. When faced with these constraints, we try to alleviate them by utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to meet the demand for our tires and by adding manufacturing capacity. However, in spite of these initiatives, we may not be able to meet all of the demand for certain of our higher margin tires, which could harm our competitive position and limit our growth.\nWe cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful. If not, we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe face significant global competition and our market share could decline.\nNew tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. Our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low-cost countries, and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in those countries as well as the United States. These increases in production capacity may result in even greater competition in the United States and elsewhere.\nOur ability to compete successfully will depend, in significant part, on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high-cost capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low-cost supply sources. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the automotive industry may experience significant changes due to the introduction of new technologies, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, or new services, business models or methods of travel, such as ride sharing. As the automotive industry evolves, we may need to provide a wider range of products and services to remain competitive, including products that we do not currently have the capability to manufacture or services that we do not currently offer. The demand for our products may also decline if automotive production declines and/or total vehicle miles traveled declines. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to market developments, technological innovations and changing customer and consumer needs and preferences, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRaw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRaw material costs have historically been volatile, and we may experience increases in the prices of natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and petrochemical-based commodities. Market conditions, including actions by competitors, or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing any such increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. Additionally, higher raw material and energy costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. As a result, higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition. The volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins, operating results and liquidity to fluctuate. In addition, lower raw material costs may put downward pressure on the price of tires, which could ultimately reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to extend or renegotiate significant collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions, which represent a significant number of our employees. Our master collective bargaining agreement with the USW covers approximately 5,700 of our associates in the United States at December 31, 2020, and expires in July 2022. In addition, approximately 20,000 of our associates outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in 2021, primarily in Germany, Luxembourg, China, Slovenia, France, Turkey, India and Mexico. Although we believe that our relations with our associates are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption, we could experience a significant\ndisruption of, or inefficiencies in, our operations or incur higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe could be negatively impacted by the imposition of tariffs on imported tires and other goods.\nThe imposition of tariffs on certain tires imported from China or other countries may reduce our flexibility to utilize our global manufacturing footprint to meet demand for our tires around the world. In addition, the imposition of tariffs in the United States may result in the tires subject to such tariffs being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or Asia, or in retaliatory tariffs or other actions by affected countries. Broad-based tariffs and other trade restrictions could also increase costs for our suppliers who may increase prices to us. Finally, tariffs and other trade restrictions may weaken the economies of key markets for us, such as China, resulting in lower economic growth rates and weakened demand for our products and services. These factors, individually or together, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world. Our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nadverse foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nadverse currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nwithholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;\n\u2022\ntax policies and regulations;\n\u2022\nlabor regulations;\n\u2022\ntariffs;\n\u2022\ngovernment price and profit margin controls;\n\u2022\nexpropriations of property;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;\n\u2022\nthe potential instability of foreign governments;\n\u2022\nhostility from local populations and insurrections;\n\u2022\nrisks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions; and\n\u2022\nother changes in laws or government policies.\nThe likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, are inherently more economically and politically volatile and, as a result, our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods.\nIn addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against\nus, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations.\nWe have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2020, foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by $233 million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by $2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results.\nOur long term ability to meet our obligations, to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results.\nThe adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements, financing from third parties and access to capital markets. We may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives. These actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity, or the factoring of our accounts receivable.\nOur access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on, among other things, the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us or our suppliers, or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit, and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives. We have continued our use of supplier financing programs and the factoring of our accounts receivable in order to improve our working capital efficiency and reduce our costs. If these programs become unavailable or less attractive to us or our suppliers, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nFuture liquidity requirements, or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit, also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt. A substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness. As a result, we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness.\nOur inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations, and could require us to consider further measures, including deferring planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt.\nFinancial difficulties, work stoppages, supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major customers, dealers or suppliers could harm our business.\nThe tire industry has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly earlier in 2020, which was characterized by a sudden and sharp decline in replacement tire demand and original equipment manufacturers suspending or severely limiting automobile production globally. As a result of the ongoing pandemic, automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict.\nAlthough sales to our OE customers accounted for approximately 17% of our net sales in 2020, demand for our products by OE customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production. We may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales, the performance, discontinuation or sale of certain OE brands, platforms or programs, increased competition, or weakness in the demand for replacement tires, which could result in us incurring under-absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs.\nAutomotive production can also be affected by the ongoing pandemic, labor relation issues, financial difficulties or supply disruptions. Our OE customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor, financial or supply difficulties, or from government actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19. Such events may cause an OE customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production. Other customers, such as dealers, retailers or distributors, may\nexperience similar disruptions to their operations. As a result, a customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products, which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur suppliers could also experience production disruptions due to the ongoing pandemic or labor, financial or supply difficulties, or new environmental laws or stricter enforcement of existing environmental laws. Any such production disruptions may result in the unexpected closure of our suppliers' facilities or increases in the cost of our raw materials, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major customers, dealers or suppliers could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nOur capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. In addition, we significantly reduced our capital expenditures in 2020 in order to preserve cash as part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors.\nProductivity improvements and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. In addition, as part of our strategy to reduce high-cost and excess manufacturing capacity and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires, we may need to modernize or expand our facilities. We are currently undertaking significant construction, expansion and modernization projects in the United States, Germany, Slovenia and Thailand.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations, or within desired time frames and budgets. Any disruption to our operations, delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements, which may harm our competitive position, or to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments. In addition, plant construction and modernization may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2020, our debt (including finance leases) on a consolidated basis was approximately $6.0 billion. Our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use cash flows from operating activities in other areas of our business or to return cash to shareholders because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.\nThe agreements governing our debt, including our credit agreements, limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future, including additional secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.\nAny failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments, or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.\nThe agreements governing our secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends, repurchase shares or make certain other restricted payments or investments;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nincur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;\n\u2022\nenter into affiliate transactions;\n\u2022\nengage in sale/leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets.\nAvailability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory, the value of our principal trademarks, the value of eligible machinery and equipment, and certain cash in an amount not to exceed $200 million. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.\nA breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities, could result in an event of default under those agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds. If any of these events occur, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if we obtain additional or alternative financing, we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nCertain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future if we desire to do so, or that any existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.4 billion of variable rate debt outstanding.\nWe have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.\nWe operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.\nWe may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters.\nWe have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters. The major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers' compensation and other employment-related claims, product liability and other tort claims, including asbestos claims, and environmental matters. Our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and, where applicable, any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters. Our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur that we did not anticipate. Such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages, fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products. If such an unfavorable decision were to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs, or in future periods.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations, including with respect to transfer pricing. While we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally, support transfer prices through economic studies, seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate, such transfer prices, and related interpretations of tax laws, are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities globally. We have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions. Although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws, have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims.\nIf we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings, we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court. If we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets, including foreign tax credits. We must generate sufficient earnings of the appropriate character in order to utilize our deferred tax assets prior to any applicable expiration dates. If our earnings remain flat or decline over an extended period of time, we may not be able to utilize certain of our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration and we may need to record an additional valuation allowance against them that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which the valuation allowance is recorded.\nFor further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters, refer to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements No. 19, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, and No. 6, Income Taxes, in this Form 10-K. For further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions, refer to \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d\nWe are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having safety-related defects or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard.\nThe Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act, or TREAD Act, imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers, among other things, to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with the TREAD Act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. We have been subject to recalls in the past and it is possible that a recall of our tires, including under the TREAD Act or in other countries under similar regulations, could occur in the future. A substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, NHTSA may establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program. If a related rule-making process is completed, certain tires sold in the United States would be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear. While the federal law preempts state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after January 1, 2006, we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation, either in the United States or other countries.\nOur European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. In 2009, two regulations, the Tire Safety Regulation and the Tire Labeling Regulation, applicable to tires sold in the European Union were adopted. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics. Other countries, such as Brazil, have also adopted tire labeling regulations, and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future.\nTires produced or sold in Europe also have to comply with various other standards, including environmental laws such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemical Substances), which regulates the use of chemicals in the European Union. For example, REACH prohibits the use of highly aromatic oils in tires, which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics.\nThese U.S. and European regulations, rules adopted to implement these regulations, or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nLaws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. As a manufacturing company, we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the United States. We may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times. Our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved, and that difference may be material.\nIn addition, our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns. While the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted, a \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system similar to the one adopted in the European Union could be adopted in the United States. Any such \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d system (including the system currently in place in the European Union) or other limitations imposed on the emission of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could require us to increase our capital expenditures, use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nCompliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology, or IT, systems across all of our major business functions, including our research and development, manufacturing, retail, financial and administrative functions. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary. Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, natural disasters and other similar disruptions. We may incur significant costs in order to implement the security measures that we feel are necessary to protect our IT systems. However, our IT systems may remain vulnerable to damage despite our implementation of security measures that we deem to be appropriate.\nAny system failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruptions to our operations. A breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our manufacturing or retail operations, or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. While we have, from time to time, experienced system failures, accidents and security breaches involving our IT systems, these incidents have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any resulting theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in material disruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, material data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business substantially depends on the continued service of key members of our management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of our management could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. Our ability to attract and retain employees may be hampered due to the current cyclical downturn in the automotive and tire industries, which has resulted in reduced payments under our incentive compensation plans over the last several years. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high quality employees, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be impacted by economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.\nWe manage businesses and facilities worldwide. Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. We may not be insured against all such potential losses and, if insured, the insurance proceeds that we receive may not adequately compensate us for all of our losses. If the frequency or severity of natural disasters increases over time, we may experience a greater number of losses at certain of our facilities. Such losses could lead to an increase in the deductibles or cost of insurance for those facilities, or to the unavailability of insurance on terms that are acceptable to us.", "PERMNO": 16432, "SIC": 3011, "TIC": "GT"}
