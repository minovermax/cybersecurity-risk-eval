{"cik": "1412486", "company": "Cocrystal Pharma, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included or incorporated in this Annual Report. Each of these risk factors, either alone or taken together, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, and adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not know of or that we believe are immaterial that could also impair our business and financial position.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors before deciding whether to invest in the Company. If any of the events discussed in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the value and marketability of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL\nWe have never generated revenue from product sales and expect that due to the regulatory constraints on a drug development company with products in the pre-clinical and early clinical stages, we may never generate revenue from product sales and may continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a pre-clinical and early stage clinical, biopharmaceutical discovery and development company. From inception until 2016, our operations were limited to organizing and staffing the Company, acquiring and developing intellectual property rights, developing our technology platform, undertaking basic research on viral replication enzyme targets and conducting preclinical studies for our initial programs. We currently have only one product candidate which has completed a Phase 2a clinical trial. Because of the need to complete clinical trials, establish safety and efficacy and obtain regulatory approval, which is an expensive and time-consuming process, we do not anticipate generating revenue from product sales for at least five years and will continue to sustain considerable losses. We may develop a partnership that could generate income sooner, but there is no guarantee that will be achievable.\nTo date, we have devoted the majority of our financial resources to research and development. We have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and entering into research collaborations. The results of our operations will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic alliances or grants. We anticipate our expenses will increase substantially if and as we continue our research and clinical and preclinical development of our product candidates. We anticipate that if we continue to undertake clinical studies our expenses will increase even further.\nWe have lost $235 million from inception through December 31, 2019 and expect to continue losing money in the future. We may never achieve income from operations or have positive cash flow from operations.\nAs an early stage drug development company, our focus is on developing product candidates, obtaining regulatory approvals and commercializing pharmaceutical products. As a result, we have lost $235 million from inception through December 31, 2019, expect losses to continue, and have never generated revenue from product sales. It is likely that we will need to raise money again in the future. We cannot assure you that we will ever generate income from operations or have positive cash flow from operations.\nBecause we have yet to generate any revenue from product sales on which to evaluate our potential for future success and to determine if we will be able to execute our business plan, it is difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risk of success or failure of our business.\nOur ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with partners, to successfully complete the development of, obtain the regulatory approvals for and commercialize pharmaceutical product candidates. We have no pharmaceutical product candidates that have generated any commercial revenue, do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of pharmaceutical products for many years, and might never generate revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical products. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things, the following:\n\u25cf identifying and validating new therapeutic strategies;\n\u25cf entering into collaborations with large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, similar to our recently announced Collaboration Agreement with Merck;\n\u25cf completing our research and preclinical development of pharmaceutical product candidates;\n\u25cf initiating and completing clinical trials for pharmaceutical product candidates;\n\u25cf seeking and obtaining regulatory marketing approvals for pharmaceutical product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u25cf establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties;\n\u25cf launching and commercializing pharmaceutical product candidates for which we obtain regulatory marketing approval, with a partner or, if launched independently, successfully establishing a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u25cf maintaining, protecting, enforcing, defending and expanding our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u25cf attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we cannot predict the timing or amount of increased expenses and when we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability, if ever. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by regulatory agencies to perform unanticipated studies and trials.\nEven if one or more pharmaceutical product candidates we independently develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved pharmaceutical product candidate. Moreover, even if we can generate revenues from the sale of any approved pharmaceutical products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nBecause early stage drug development requires major capital investment, as we continue to incur operating losses, we will need to raise additional capital or form strategic partnerships to support our research and development activities in the future.\nWe are still in the early stages of development of our product candidates and have no products approved for commercial sale. Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is capital-intensive. As a rule, research and development expenses increase substantially as we advance our product candidates toward clinical programs. We currently have one hepatitis C product candidate that has completed a Phase 2a clinical trial and have secured funding of the research and development of influenza A/B product candidates under our Collaboration Agreement with Merck. See \u201cItem 1 - Business - Collaborations - Merck Collaboration.\u201d However, in order to conduct trials for our other product candidates, we will need to raise additional capital to support our operations or form partnerships, in addition to our existing collaborative alliances, which may give substantial rights to a partner. Such funding or partnerships may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Moreover, any future financing may be very dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nAs we move lead compounds through toxicology and other preclinical studies, also referred to as nonclinical studies, we have and we will be required to file an Investigational New Drug application (\u201cIND\u201d) or its equivalent in foreign countries, and as we conduct clinical development of product candidates, we may have adverse results that may cause us to consume additional capital. Our partners may not elect to pursue the development and commercialization of our product candidates subject to our respective agreements with them. These events may increase our development costs more than we expect. We may need to raise additional capital or otherwise obtain funding through strategic alliances if we initiate clinical trials for new product candidates other than programs currently partnered. We will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, product candidates.\nIn securing additional financing, such additional fundraising efforts may divert our management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates. We cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u25cf significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of any product candidates;\n\u25cf seek strategic alliances for research and development programs at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u25cf relinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or any product candidates we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing development and commercialization efforts, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects or may render the Company unable to continue operations.\nBecause, we are unable to rely on certain exemptions from registration under the federal securities laws, as the result of a \u201cdisqualifying event\u201d involving a director of the Company, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing.\nOn January 10, 2019, Dr. Frost, one of our directors, was permanently enjoined from violating a certain anti-fraud provision of the Securities Act of 1933, future violations of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-1(a) thereunder, and participating in penny stock offerings with certain exceptions. So long as Dr. Frost is a director, the Company will be unable to rely on certain exemptions from registration including the exemptions under Regulation A and Rule 506 promulgated under the Securities Act absent a waiver issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). We have not applied for a waiver, and even if we do, the SEC may choose not to grant us a waiver. While there is a statutory exemption for private placements under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, the absence of the Rule 506 safe harbor under Regulation D could adversely affect our ability to raise necessary financing in the future on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nBecause of the unknown impact from the COVID-19 virus, it may have unanticipated material adverse effects upon us.\nThe United States and global impact from the COVID-19 virus may have a material adverse effect on us in a number of ways including:\n\u25cf If our scientists and other personnel (or their family members) are infected with the virus, it may hamper our ability to engage in ongoing research activities;\n\u25cf Similarly, we rely on third parties who can be similarly impacted;\n\u25cf If these third parties are affected by COVID-19, they may focus on other activities which they may devote their limited time to other priorities rather than to our joint research;\n\u25cf We may experience a shortage of laboratory materials which would impact our research activities;\n\u25cf As a result of the continuing impact of the virus, we may fail to get access to third party laboratories which would impact our research activities; and\n\u25cf We may sustain problems due to the serious short-term and possible longer term serious economic disruptions as our economy faces unprecedented uncertainty.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES\nWe will depend substantially on Merck for the successful research, development and commercialization of our influenza A/B product candidates.\nIn January 2019, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Merck to research, develop, and commercialize certain proprietary influenza A/B antiviral agents. See \u201cItem 1 - Business - Collaborations - Merck Collaboration\u201d for more information on the Collaboration Agreement. The success of this collaborative alliance will depend substantially on the efforts and activities of Merck. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, in case the joint research committee overseeing the research program cannot reach an agreement, the ultimate decision-making authority is vested in Merck as to most matters. Furthermore, Merck will be solely responsible for the development and commercialization of any products derived from the collaboration.\nIn addition, during the term of the research program and for a period of 12 months following the expiration or termination of the research program under the Collaboration Agreement, we have agreed to work exclusively with Merck on the research and development of influenza A/B antiviral agents. During the term of the Collaboration Agreement, we will be unable to conduct, or enable third parties to conduct, research, development and commercialization activities related to such agents. These restrictions may impair our ability to pursue research, development and commercialization opportunities that we would otherwise deem to be beneficial to our business.\nIf our research collaboration with Merck is terminated or is otherwise unsuccessful, including failure to reach milestones, we could lose the research program funding, and would not receive milestone payments or royalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, our ability to successfully develop and commercialize influenza A/B product candidates and our future financial condition.\nPursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Merck agreed to, among other things, (i) fund the research and development collaboration, including clinical development and commercialization; (ii) make certain milestone payments up to a total of $156 million, including payments associated with the successful product development and attainment of certain U.S. and EU regulatory approvals for the developed products and sales volume; and (iii) pay royalties on net sales of the products.\nMerck can terminate the Collaboration Agreement at any time prior to the first commercial sale of the first product developed under the Collaboration Agreement, in its sole discretion, without cause. Furthermore, research collaborations, including the Collaboration Agreement, may turn out to be unsuccessful and are subject to certain risks, including the following risks:\n\u25cf disagreements with Merck resulting in delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, or litigation;\n\u25cf change the focus by Merck of its development and commercialization efforts;\n\u25cf failure by Merck to commit sufficient resources to the testing, marketing, distribution or development of product candidates; and\n\u25cf development by Merck of alternative products either on its own or in collaboration with others, or conflicts of interest or changes in business strategy or other business issues, which could adversely affect its willingness or ability to fulfill their obligations to us.\nIf our collaboration with Merck is unsuccessful for these or other reasons, or is otherwise terminated for any reason, we may lose the research program funding, and would not receive the milestone payments or royalties under the Collaboration Agreement.\nFurther, pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement Merck will only be obligated to make many of the milestone payments if our influenza A/B product receives required regulatory approvals, is commercialized and net sales exceed the thresholds set forth in the Collaboration Agreement. Achieving the milestones may be difficult and time-consuming. If some or all of these goals are not achieved, we may not receive some or all of the milestone payments under the Collaboration Agreement.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to successfully develop and commercialize influenza A/B product candidates and our future financial condition.\nIf we form strategic alliances which are unsuccessful or are terminated, we may be unable to develop or commercialize certain product candidates and we may be unable to generate revenues from our development programs.\nIn addition to the Collaboration Agreement with Merck, we are likely to use third-party alliance partners for financial, scientific, manufacturing, marketing and sales resources for the clinical development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates. These strategic alliances will likely constrain our control over development and commercialization of our product candidates, especially once a candidate has reached the stage of clinical development. Our ability to recognize revenues from successful strategic alliances may be impaired by several factors including:\n\u25cf a partner may shift its priorities and resources away from our programs due to a change in business strategies, or a merger, acquisition, sale or downsizing of its company or business unit;\n\u25cf a partner may cease development in therapeutic areas which are the subject of our strategic alliances;\n\u25cf a partner may change the success criteria for a program or product candidate delaying or ceasing development of such program or candidate;\n\u25cf a significant delay in initiation of certain development activities by a partner could also delay payment of milestones tied to such activities, impacting our ability to fund our own activities;\n\u25cf a partner could develop a product that competes, either directly or indirectly, with an alliance product;\n\u25cf a partner with commercialization obligations may not commit sufficient financial or human resources to the marketing, distribution or sale of a product;\n\u25cf a partner with manufacturing responsibilities may encounter regulatory, resource or quality issues and be unable to meet demand requirements;\n\u25cf a partner may exercise its rights under the agreement to terminate a strategic alliance, including termination without cause;\n\u25cf a dispute may arise between us and a partner concerning the research, development or commercialization of a program or product candidate resulting in a delay in milestones, royalty payments or termination of a program and possibly resulting in costly litigation or arbitration which may divert management attention and resources; and\n\u25cf a partner may use our proprietary information or intellectual property to invite litigation from a third-party or fail to maintain or prosecute intellectual property rights possibly jeopardizing our rights in such property.\nTermination of a strategic alliance may require us to seek out and establish alternative strategic alliances with third-party partners. This may not be possible, including due to restrictions under the terms of our existing collaborations, or we may not be able to do so on terms acceptable to us. See \u201cItem 1A - Risk Factors - We will depend substantially on Merck for the successful research, development and commercialization of our influenza A/B product candidates.\u201d If we fail to establish alternative strategic alliances with third-party partners on terms acceptable to us, or at all, we may be required to limit the size or scope of one or more of our programs or decrease our expenditures and seek additional funding by other means. Such events would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct some or all aspects of our compound formulation, research and preclinical testing, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not expect to independently conduct most and certainly not all aspects of our drug discovery activities, compound formulation research or preclinical testing of product candidates. We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct some aspects of our preclinical testing and on third-party Clinical Research Organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to conduct clinical trials.\nIf these third parties terminate their engagements, we will need to enter into alternative arrangements which would delay our product development activities. Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. If in the future, we elect to develop and commercialize any product candidates on our own, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our IND-enabling preclinical studies and clinical trials are conducted under the respective study plans and trial protocols. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our studies under regulatory requirements or our stated study plans and protocols, we will not be able to complete, or may experience delays in completing, the necessary clinical trials and preclinical studies to enable us or our partners to select viable product candidates for IND submissions and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully develop and commercialize such product candidates.\nBecause we intend to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our preclinical and clinical supplies, and commercial supplies of any approved product candidates, we will be subject to a variety of risks.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers to develop products and our anticipated reliance on third-party manufacturers to produce products we may develop in the future entail risks to which we would not be subject if we supplied the materials needed to develop and manufacture our product candidates ourselves, including:\n\u25cf the inability to meet any product specifications and quality requirements consistently;\n\u25cf a delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;\n\u25cf discontinuation or recall of reagents, test kits, instruments, and other items used by us in the development, testing, and potential commercialization of products;\n\u25cf manufacturing and product quality issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u25cf costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;\n\u25cf a failure to comply with cGMP and similar foreign standards;\n\u25cf the inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u25cf the reliance on a few sources, and sometimes, single sources for raw materials, such that if we cannot secure a sufficient supply of these product components, we cannot manufacture and sell product candidates in a timely fashion, in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms;\n\u25cf the lack of qualified backup suppliers for any raw materials currently purchased from a single source supplier;\n\u25cf operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier;\n\u25cf carrier disruptions or increased costs beyond our control;\n\u25cf misappropriation of our proprietary technology for the purpose of manufacturing a \u201cgeneric\u201d version of our product or sale of our product to organizations that distribute and sell counterfeit goods, including drugs; and\n\u25cf failing to deliver products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner.\nThese events could lead to clinical study delays or failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize future products. Some of these events could be the basis for regulatory actions, including injunction, recall, seizure or total or partial suspension of production.\nBecause we expect to rely on limited sources of supply for the drug substance and drug product of product candidates, any disruption in the chain of supply may cause a delay in developing and commercializing these product candidates.\nWe intend to establish manufacturing relationships with a limited number of suppliers to manufacture raw materials, the drug substance, and the drug product of any product candidate for which we are responsible for preclinical or clinical development. Each supplier may require licenses to manufacture such components if such processes are not owned by the supplier or in the public domain. As part of any marketing approval, a manufacturer and its processes must be qualified by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities prior to commercialization. If supply from the approved vendor is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. An alternative vendor would need to be qualified through an NDA or marketing authorization supplement, which could cause further delay. The FDA or other regulatory agencies outside of the United States may also require additional studies if a new supplier is relied upon for commercial production.\nThese factors could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our products successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of drug substance or drug product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue.\nManufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or delay commercialization.\nAs third parties scale up manufacturing of product candidates and conduct required stability testing, product, packaging, equipment and process-related issues may require refinement or resolution to proceed with any clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for commercial marketing. We or the manufacturers may identify significant impurities or stability problems, which could cause discontinuation or recall by us or our manufacturers, increased scrutiny by regulatory agencies, delays in clinical programs and regulatory approval, significant increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for product candidates or any approved products.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials. While we have agreements governing the activities of such CROs and clinical trial sites, we or our partners will have limited influence over their actual performance. Nevertheless, we or our partners will be responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its protocol, and that all legal, regulatory and scientific standards are met. Our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWe, our partners and our CROs must comply with current Good Clinical Practices (\u201ccGCPs\u201d), as defined by the FDA and the International Conference on Harmonization, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of IND-enabling preclinical studies and clinical trials, to ensure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or other regulators may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications. Our clinical trials will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate. If our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, fail to recruit properly qualified patients or fail to properly record or maintain patient data, we may be required to repeat such clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur contracted CROs will not be our employees, and we cannot control whether they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials, or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to failing to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our financial results and the commercial prospects for such products and any product candidates we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug products for any clinical trials we may conduct. Any performance failure by our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCT CANDIDATES\nBecause the approach we are taking to discover and develop drugs is novel, it may never lead to marketable products.\nWe are concentrating our antiviral therapeutic product research and development efforts using our proprietary technology, and our future success depends on the continued successful development of this technology and the products derived from it. We have no drug products commercialized. The scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop drug product candidates are relatively new and unproven. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing product candidates based on our approach is limited. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize drug product candidates based upon our technological approach, we may not become profitable and the value of our stock may decline.\nFurther, our focus on the Company\u2019s technology for developing drugs, as opposed to relying entirely on more standard technologies for drug development, increases the risks associated with the ownership of our stock. If we are unsuccessful in developing any product candidates using the Company\u2019s technology, we may be required to change the scope and direction of our product development activities. We may not successfully identify and implement an alternative product development strategy and may as a result cease operations.\nIf we do not succeed in our efforts to identify or discover potential product candidates, your investment may be lost.\nThe success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to identify, develop and commercialize antiviral drug products, an extremely risky business. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for several reasons, including:\n\u25cf our research methodology or that of our partners may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u25cf potential product candidates may have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval; and\n\u25cf we or our partners may change their development profiles for potential product candidates or abandon a therapeutic area.\nSuch events may force us to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could cause us to cease operations. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nBecause our future commercial success depends on gaining regulatory approval for our products, we cannot generate revenue without obtaining approvals.\nOur long-term success and generation of revenue will depend upon the successful development of new products from our research and development activities, including those licensed or acquired from third parties. Product development is very expensive and involves a high degree of risk. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. The process for obtaining regulatory approval to market a product like our hepatitis C or influenza products is expensive, takes many years, and can vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidates involved. Our ability to generate revenues would be adversely affected if we are delayed or unable to successfully develop our products.\nWe cannot guarantee that any marketing application for our product candidates will be approved. If we do not obtain regulatory approval of our products or we are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, we cannot generate revenue, and we may need to significantly curtail operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe intend to invest a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the identification and preclinical development of product candidates that target viral replication enzymes. Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including:\n\u25cf successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf receipt of marketing and pricing approvals from regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for product candidates;\n\u25cf establishing and maintaining manufacturing relationships with third parties or establishing our own manufacturing capability; and\n\u25cf commercializing our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully complete development of, or to successfully commercialize, our product candidates, which would materially harm our business. Most pharmaceutical products that do overcome the long odds of drug development and achieve commercialization still do not recoup their cost of capital. If we are unable to design and develop each drug to meet a commercial need far in the future, the approved drug may become a commercial failure and our investment in those development and commercialization efforts will have been commercially unsuccessful.\nWe may be unable to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of product candidates, we or our partners must conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products.\nEvents that may cause a delay or unsuccessful completion of clinical development include, as examples:\n\u25cf delays in agreeing with the FDA or other regulatory authorities on final clinical trial design;\n\u25cf imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf delays in agreeing on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u25cf delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u25cf delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of the product candidates to the clinical sites;\n\u25cf delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf delays caused by patients dropping out of a trial due to product side effects or disease progression;\n\u25cf clinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u25cf time required to add new clinical sites; or\n\u25cf delays by our contract manufacturers in producing and delivering sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIf we or our partners must conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of any product candidates beyond those that are contemplated, or are unable to successfully complete clinical trials or other testing of any of our product candidates, or if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we or our partners may:\n\u25cf be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf not obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u25cf obtain approval for indications or patient populations not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u25cf obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u25cf be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u25cf remove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or in obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which would impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. Any inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development, whether independently or with our partners, could cause additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from our product candidates, including product sales, milestone payments, profit sharing or royalties.\nOur product candidates may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nAdverse events (\u201cAEs\u201d) or serious adverse events (SAEs\u201d), that may be observed during clinical trials of our product candidates could cause us, other reviewing entities, clinical trial sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt such trials and could cause denial of regulatory approval. If AEs or SAEs are observed in any clinical trials of our product candidates, including those our partners may develop under alliance agreements, our or our partners\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory approval for product candidates may be negatively impacted.\nSerious or unexpected side effects caused by an approved product could result in significant negative consequences, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw prior approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;\n\u25cf we may be required to add labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nThese events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our products and impair our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our partners.\nFollowing regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and the approved product may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere, the applicable regulators may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. The following discussion is based on United States law. Similar types of regulatory provision apply outside of the United States.\nThe holder of an approved New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d), must monitor and report AEs and SAEs and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and other applicable federal and state laws and are subject to FDA review.\nDrug product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d), and adherence to commitments made in the NDA. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product such as AEs or SAEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we or our partners fail to comply with regulatory requirements following approval of our product candidates, a regulatory agency may:\n\u25cf issue a warning letter asserting we are in violation of the law;\n\u25cf seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u25cf suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u25cf suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf refuse to approve a pending NDA or supplements to an NDA submitted by us;\n\u25cf seize product; or\n\u25cf refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nOur defense of any government investigation of alleged violations of law, or any lawsuit alleging such violations, could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may prevent or inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenues.\nWe may not succeed in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to drug compounds and processes for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nCompanies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.\nBecause third parties may be developing competitive products without our knowledge, we may later learn that competitive products are superior to our product candidates which may force us to terminate our research efforts of one or more product candidates.\nWe face potential competition from companies, particularly privately-held companies and foreign companies that may be developing competitive products that are superior to one or more of our product candidates. If in the future, we learn of the existence of one or more competitive products, we may be required to:\n\u25cf cease our development efforts for a product candidate;\n\u25cf cause a partner to terminate its support of a product candidate; or\n\u25cf cause a potential partner to terminate discussions about a potential license.\nAny of these events may occur after we have spent substantial sums in connection with the clinical research of one or more product candidates.\nCompliance with governmental regulations regarding the treatment of animals used in research could increase our operating costs, which would adversely affect the commercialization of our technology.\nThe Animal Welfare Act (\u201cAWA\u201d), is the United States federal law that covers the treatment of certain animals used in research. The AWA imposes a wide variety of specific regulations that govern the humane handling, care, treatment and transportation of certain animals by producers and users of research animals, most notably relating to personnel, facilities, sanitation, cage size, feeding, watering and shipping conditions. Third parties with whom we contract are subject to registration, inspections and reporting requirements. Some states have their own regulations, including general anti-cruelty legislation, which establish certain standards for handling animals. If we or our contractors fail to comply with United States and foreign laws and regulations, as applicable, concerning the treatment of animals used in research, we may be subject to fines and penalties and adverse publicity, and our operations could be adversely affected.\nPublic perception of ethical and social issues may limit or discourage the type of research we conduct.\nOur clinical trials will involve people, and we and third parties with whom we contract also conduct research using animals. Governmental authorities could, for public health or other reasons, limit the use of human or animal research or prohibit the use of our technology. In addition, animal rights activists may protest or make threats against our facilities, which may cause property damage and delay our research. Ethical and other concerns about our methods, including our use of human subjects in clinical trials and our use of animal testing, could adversely affect our market acceptance.\nWe have limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical development activities and clinical trials necessary to obtain approvals for marketing our product candidates, including approval by the FDA.\nOur efforts to develop our product candidates are at an early stage. To date, with one exception, we have not entered a compound into human clinical trials. We may be unable to progress our other product candidates undergoing preclinical testing into clinical trials. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will succeed, and favorable initial results from a clinical trial do not determine outcomes in subsequent clinical trials. The indications of use for which we are pursuing development may have clinical effectiveness endpoints not previously reviewed or validated by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, which may complicate or delay our effort to obtain marketing approval. We cannot guarantee that our clinical trials will succeed. In fact, most compounds fail in clinical trials, even at companies far larger and more experienced than us.\nWe have not obtained marketing approval or commercialized any of our product candidates. We may not successfully design or implement clinical trials required for marketing approval to market our product candidates. If we are unsuccessful in conducting and managing our preclinical development activities or clinical trials or obtaining marketing approvals, we might not be able to commercialize our product candidates, or might be significantly delayed in doing so, which will materially harm our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we cannot obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our future products and product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our future products and product candidates. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications we own or in-license may fail to result in patents with claims that cover the products in the United States or in other countries. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found; such prior art can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing based on a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may cause such patents to be narrowed or invalidated. Even if unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims.\nIf the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed regarding our programs or product candidates fail to issue or if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop product candidates, and threaten our ability to commercialize products. Patents may not issue and issued patents may be found invalid and unenforceable or challenged by third parties. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent a patent application related to a product candidate. In certain situations, if we and one or more third parties have filed patent applications in the United States and claiming the same subject matter, an administrative proceeding can be initiated to determine which applicant is entitled to the patent on that subject matter. Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is 20 years after it is filed, although various extensions may be available. The life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. When the patent life has expired for a product, we will become vulnerable to competition from generic medications attempting to replicate that product. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the time during which we will be able to market and commercialize a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced.\nIn addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology not covered by patents. Each of our employees agrees to assign their inventions to us through an employee inventions agreement. In addition, as a general practice, our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology enter into confidentiality agreements. Nonetheless, our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information may be disclosed and competitors may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. In addition, in January 2018 the FDA as part of its Transparency Initiative, launched a voluntary pilot program calling on biopharmaceutical research companies to release clinical study reports summarizing clinical trial data. However, with a low response rate to this initiative thus far, the FDA may consider making release of clinical study reports mandatory and may consider making additional information publicly available on a routine basis in response to concerns expressed by the academic community, including information we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information. If the FDA takes these measures, we may be forced to disclose propriety information about our product candidates and research, which could materially harm our business.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. We may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird-party intellectual property infringement claims may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement on the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is substantial litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, and reexaminations and other post-grant proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our partners are pursuing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be patent applications currently pending that may later result in patents that our product candidates may infringe. Third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes on these patents. If any third-party patents were to be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patents were to be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nParties making intellectual property claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, involves substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our business. If a claim of infringement against us succeeds, we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nWe may need to obtain licenses to intellectual property rights from third parties.\nWe may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our products, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales and other activities, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties. Because of the costs involved in defending patent litigation, we currently lack and may in the future lack the capital to defend our intellectual property rights.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter such infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, or we may be required to defend the validity or enforceability of such patents, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that either one or more of our patents or our licensors\u2019 patents is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue because our patents do not cover that technology. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions regarding our patents or patent applications or those of our partners or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may cause us to incur substantial costs and distract the attention of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nBecause of the substantial amount of discovery required in intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities.\nWe may be subject to claims our that employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe employ individuals previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims asserting that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and if we succeed, litigation could cause substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees.\nBecause we face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. We have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. This enables them, among other things, to make greater research and development investments and efficiently utilize their research and development costs. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may cause even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further because of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may develop, acquire or license drug products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate we may develop.\nWith the exception of one product candidate, all of our programs are in a preclinical development stage and are targeted toward indications for which there are approved products on the market or product candidates in clinical development. We will face competition from other drugs that are or will be approved for the same therapeutic indications. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to leverage our experience in drug discovery and development to:\n\u25cf discover and develop therapeutics superior to other products in the market;\n\u25cf attract qualified scientific, product development and commercial personnel;\n\u25cf obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our technology platform and product candidates;\n\u25cf obtain required regulatory approvals; and\n\u25cf successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of new therapeutics.\nThe availability of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand, and the price we can charge, for any products we may develop and commercialize. We will not achieve our business plan if the acceptance of these products is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing drug products to our products, or if physicians switch to other new drug products or reserve our products for use in limited circumstances. Additionally, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological and scientific change, and we may not be able to adapt to these rapid changes to the extent necessary to keep up with competitors or at all. The inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced drug products would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nEstablished pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make our product candidates less competitive. Any new product that competes with an approved product must typically demonstrate advantages, such as in efficacy, convenience, tolerability or safety, to overcome price competition and to succeed. Our competitors may obtain patent protection, receive approval by FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities or discover, develop and commercialize product candidates before we do, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon the acceptance of these product candidates by the medical community, including physicians, patients and healthcare payors.\nAssuming one or more product candidates achieve regulatory approval and we commence marketing such products, the market acceptance of any product candidates will depend on several factors, including:\n\u25cf demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n\u25cf the relative convenience, ease of administration and acceptance by physicians, patients and healthcare payors;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any AEs or SAEs;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings in the label approved by FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities for such products;\n\u25cf availability of alternative treatments;\n\u25cf pricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf the execution and effectiveness of our or any collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain hospital formulary approval; and\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party payor coverage or reimbursement.\nIf our current product candidates are approved, we expect sales to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, and as such, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would harm our business.\nIf insurance and/or government coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available for our product candidates, it could impair our ability to achieve and maintain profitability.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any product candidates we develop will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers, hospitals and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for some or all of our product candidates. As patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment, inadequate reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our future products. Thus, the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process, and no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptable. If reimbursement is not available, or is available at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize product candidates we develop.\nPricing pressures on our drug candidates, including as the result of proposed legislative changes, may negatively impact our future results of operations.\nThere have been numerous legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the United States and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell products profitably. For example, in May 2018, the Trump administration issued a plan to lower drug prices, including among other things the disclosure of list prices in television ads, increasing negotiated discounts in Medicare, banning pharmacy gag clauses, adopting real-time prescription benefit tools, and boosting low-cost generic and biosimilar competition. In January 2019, the Trump administration proposed a rule to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs by banning rebates on prescription drugs paid by manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers, Part D plans and Medicaid managed care organizations to increase the use and sales of their products.\nFurther, in February 2019, President Trump expressed concern that prescription drug prices in Canada are approximately 50% of prescription drug prices in the United States. At the same time, the current Democratic Presidential candidate is advocating for a Medicare-for-all approach. While expanding Medicare would increase the demand for prescription drugs, there is a likelihood that Medicare will be required to negotiate drug prices, which could adversely affect our future prospects.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control drug pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, if approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. The availability of generic treatments may also substantially increase pricing pressures on, and reduce reimbursement for, our future products. The potential application of user fees to generic drug products may expedite approval of additional generic drug treatments. We expect to experience additional pricing pressures in connection with sale of any of our products, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes.\nIn some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. The European Union, or EU, provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the Company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and tend to be priced significantly lower.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenues from product sales.\nWe do not have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. To market any products that may be approved, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or arrange with third parties to perform these services.\nOur current and future partners may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization due to factors beyond our control. If we are unable to establish effective alliances to enable the sale of our product candidates to healthcare professionals and in geographical regions, including the United States, that will not be covered by our own marketing and sales force, or if our potential future strategic partners do not successfully commercialize the product candidates, our ability to generate revenues from product sales will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not become profitable. We will be competing with many companies that have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third-party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize any approved products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we may enter into agreements with third parties to market them on a worldwide basis or in more limited geographical regions. We expect we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u25cf different regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u25cf reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in foreign economies and markets;\n\u25cf compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25cf foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u25cf foreign currency fluctuations, which could cause increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is endemic;\n\u25cf production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u25cf business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND INDUSTRY\nIf we lose key management or scientific personnel, cannot recruit qualified employees, directors, officers, or other personnel or experience increases in our compensation costs, our business may materially suffer.\nWe depend on principal members of our executive and research teams; the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. We are highly dependent on our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Gary Wilcox, our President, Dr. Sam Lee and our Chief Financial Officer, James Martin. We do not carry \u201ckey-man\u201d life insurance on any of our employees or advisors. Furthermore, our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional personnel. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms, as there is significant competition among numerous pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets. Because of this competition, our compensation costs may increase significantly. If we lose key employees, our business may suffer.\nIf we expand our organization, we may experience difficulties in managing growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of March 30, 2020, we have 11 full-time employees. As our company matures, we expect to expand our employee base to increase our managerial, scientific and operational, commercial, financial and other resources and to hire more consultants and contractors. Future growth would impose significant additional responsibilities on our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants and contractors. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may cause weaknesses in our infrastructure, and give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as developing additional product candidates. If our management cannot effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage our future growth.\nAny relationships with customers and third-party payors may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and commercialize those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. We may be subject to patient privacy regulation by the federal government and by the U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u25cf state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nWe face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs.\nUsing our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may cause:\n\u25cf impairment of our business reputation;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf costs due to related litigation;\n\u25cf distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize our product candidates; and\n\u25cf decreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.\nInsurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If and when we obtain marketing approval for product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. Occasionally, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nBusiness interruptions resulting from pandemics, natural disasters and adverse weather events could cause delays in research and development of our product candidates.\nOur principal offices are in Bothell, Washington where we conduct our scientific research. We also maintain a small finance and accounting office in Miami, Florida. We are vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes and tornados as well as other events that could disrupt our operations and cause delays in research and development of our product candidates. We do not carry insurance for natural disasters, and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our operations. The recent coronavirus pandemic has the potential to impact our business in both the short and long run. At the moment there is uncertainty to both the extent and duration of the effect on employees and supply lines. See the Risk Factor in this Report concerning the COVID-19 virus.\nIf our information technology systems are compromised, the information we store and process, including our intellectual property, could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, which could harm our business, relationships with strategic partners and future results of operations.\nCompanies are increasingly suffering damage from attacks by hackers. In the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive information, such as our intellectual property, including trade secrets and results of our clinical and preclinical research, and that of our suppliers and business partners, on a central server, and such information is transmitted via email correspondence. The secure maintenance and processing of this information is critical to our research and development activities and future operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our information technology systems and the information stored there could be accessed by third parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, misappropriation or other loss of information could result in disruption of our operations, including our existing and future research collaborations, and damage our reputation, which in its turn could harm our business and future results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve using hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. If contamination occurs or injury results from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nThe Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as the hepatitis C virus. These requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. In addition, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act requires, among other things, that we include in our safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace.\nAlthough our workers\u2019 compensation insurance may cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur additional costs due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against other potential liabilities. We may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may cause substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nBecause we believe the recent volatility of our stock price was caused by our announcement of our License Agreement and our acquisition of rights to use the licensed patents to seek a treatment for coronavirus as well as norovirus, the increase in our stock price may be temporary for a number of reasons.\nAfter we announced our entry into the License Agreement with the Kansas State University Research Foundation, the price of our common stock surged from $0.49 as of February 21 to the closing price of $1.77 on February 26 and our daily trading volume also increased substantially during that time. Additionally, after our March 6, 2020 announcement regarding the initiation of our coronavirus program, our trading volume remained extremely high relative the prior 12-month period. Since then, our stock price has fallen to a closing price of $0.68 per share on March 26, 2020. Our common stock may continue to be volatile and could materially fall for a number of reasons including:\n\u25cf Announcements by competitors that they are initiating human trials of drugs to treat the coronavirus or with respect to a possible vaccine;\n\u25cf Public announcement that the rapid spread of the coronavirus has receded;\n\u25cf Our disclosure that the use of our technology and the patents we licensed do not appear promising for the treatment of this virus;\n\u25cf The continued large declines in major stock market indexes which causes investors to sell our common stock; or\n\u25cf The termination of any other factors which may have created the unusual volatility and spike in volume;\nWe cannot assure you that our stock price and volume will stabilize, in which case investors may sustain large losses\nDue to factors beyond our control, our common stock price may be volatile, or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares.\nThe market price of our common stock will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u25cf price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u25cf volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of biotechnology stocks generally, or those in our peer group in particular;\n\u25cf our announcements concerning the initiation and results of clinical trials;\n\u25cf changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other biotechnology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u25cf sales of shares of our stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u25cf the failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u25cf the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections.\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new novel medicines;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s reaction to our earnings releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf litigation involving us, our current or former officers and directors, our stockholders, our industry, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf any significant change in our management; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions and slow or negative growth in any of our significant markets.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. See Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a description of certain pending litigation.\nAny future impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and in-process research and development assets could depress our stock price.\nHistorically, we had a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) on our balance sheet. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events indicate it is warranted. If the carrying value of a reporting unit or IPR&D asset exceeds its current fair value, the goodwill or IPR&D asset is considered impaired. Events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our indefinite-lived assets and goodwill include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant decline in the Company\u2019s stock price for a sustained period of time, significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value, limited funding that could delay development efforts, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the Company\u2019s overall business, safety or efficacy issues that surface during development efforts, or preclinical and clinical outcomes that reduce the probability for technical and regulatory success of our product candidates.\nWe have fully written-off our IPR&D, and we no longer have an IPR&D asset as of December 31, 2018; refer to \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Business Combinations and Intangible Assets.\u201d\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had goodwill of $19,092,343 and $65,195,000 respectively. Based on the fair value of its reporting unit, measured by the Company\u2019s Nasdaq market capitalization and an income based\napproach analysis, which exceeded the carrying value at December 31, 2019; we have incurred an impairment charge of approximately $46,100,000 from our goodwill as of December 31,2019.\nWe may in the future be required to record additional impairment charges to write-off goodwill which is also related to our merger with RFS Pharma in 2014. Our stock price could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our goodwill occur.\nBecause certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our common stock, they may have effective control over our actions requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of March 13, 2020, our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders (those beneficially owning in excess of 5%), and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 29.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nDr. Raymond Schinazi, our former Board Chairman, and Dr. Philip Frost, a director and certain other stockholders entered into a Stockholders Rights Agreement in November 2014 when we acquired another company headed by Dr. Schinazi. This Agreement gives each of Dr. Schinazi and Dr. Frost (and certain other stockholders) the right to designate three directors to a seven-person board of directors and together agree upon the seventh designee. In addition, our principal stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u25cf delaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control;\n\u25cf impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u25cf discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nFurther, the Stockholder Rights Agreement provides Dr. Schinazi and Dr. Frost and certain other Company stockholders with rights including the right to approve future financings and a right of first refusal, which have not been impediments to date. However, in the event of any future disagreements between Dr. Schinazi and Dr. Frost, we may be unable to raise future capital we need or make concessions to one of these directors, which may adversely affect us or result in added expenses. Dr. Schinazi did not consent to our most recent financing in March 2020. We are uncertain what impact this may have upon us.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including under our equity incentive plan, could cause additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nIn November 2019 and February and March 2020 we conducted public offerings in which we issued a total of approximately 17.03 million shares of common stock and raised a total of approximately $20.8 million in gross proceeds. While we expect that these financings will be sufficient to fund our operations for more than the 12 months, significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we have raised and continue to raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nUnder our Equity Incentive Plans, our management may grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants. Approximately 3,588,377 million shares of common stock are available for future grant.\nWe are currently involved in a class action lawsuit, a related derivative action, and other litigation, and may in the future be involved in other legal proceedings, which may be expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business and financial condition.\nWe and certain current and former executive officers and directors of the Company are currently defendants in a class action lawsuit filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and a related derivative action lawsuit filed with the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington and may become involved in additional legal proceedings in the future.\nThese proceedings can be time consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. While we believe we have insurance coverage for the class action suit and the derivative action, our insurance carrier has initially declined to cover the lawsuits. While we are seeking to reverse this decision, even if we can do so the amount of insurance may be insufficient. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, and financial condition, and cause our stock price to decrease.\nSee \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d for more information.\nFailure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, could result in delisting of our common stock, which in its turn would negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit investors\u2019 ability to trade in our common stock.\nOur common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). Nasdaq rules impose certain continued listing requirements, including the minimum $1 bid price, corporate governance standards and number of public stockholders. On December 13, 2019, we were notified by Nasdaq that we were not compliant with its closing bid price requirement because the closing bid price of our common stock was below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days. While we have regained compliance and this matter has since been resolved, if we fail to meet these continued listing requirements in the future, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. If our common stock is delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity with respect to our common stock;\n\u25cf a determination that our shares of common stock are a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require broker-dealers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u25cf a limited ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d), and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that, with the RFS Pharma and Discovery mergers and other transactions that have occurred over the past three years, we may have triggered an \u201cownership change\u201d limitation. We may also experience ownership changes in the future because of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. If we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us. At the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We anticipate we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nBecause we may not attract the attention of major brokerage firms, it could have a material impact upon the price of our common stock.\nIt is possible that securities analysts of major brokerage firms will not provide research coverage for our common stock. The absence of such coverage limits the likelihood that an active market will develop for our common stock. It may also make it more difficult for us to attract new investors when we acquire additional capital.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause the market price for our common stock to decline, even if our business is performing well.\nAs of March 28, 2020, we had approximately 52.1 million shares of common stock outstanding, approximately 36.9 million of which are either free trading or may be sold without volume or manner of sale limitations under Rule 144. The remainder of our shares, because they are held by affiliates, are subject to additional restrictions as described below.\nIn general, Rule 144 provides that any person who is not an affiliate of the Company and has not been an affiliate for 90 days, and who has held restricted common stock for at least six months, is entitled to sell their restricted stock freely, provided that we stay current in our SEC filings. After one year, a non-affiliate may sell without any restrictions.\nOur largest stockholder, Dr. Raymond Schinazi, who beneficially owned 19.7% of our common stock as of March 29, 2020, resigned as our Board Chairman in February 2019. However, a Stockholder Rights Agreement he signed in 2014, in which another principal shareholder is a party, requires that we continue to treat him as an affiliate.\nThe shares of common stock outstanding which are held by affiliates of the Company are subject to additional restrictions. An affiliate may sell after a six-month holding period with the following restrictions:\n(i) we are current in our filings;\n(ii) certain manner of sale provisions; and\n(iii) filing of Form 144.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nWe may issue preferred stock which could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and could depress our stock price.\nIn accordance with the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and the Stockholder Rights Agreement described above, our Board may issue one or more additional series of preferred stock that have more than one vote per share, so long as the Board obtains the majority approval of each of the groups of stockholders who formerly held our Series A and Series B. This could permit our Board to issue preferred stock to investors who support our management and give effective control of our business to our management. Issuance of preferred stock could block an acquisition resulting in both a drop in our stock price and a decline in interest of our common stock. This could make it more difficult for stockholders to sell their common stock. This could also cause the market price of our common stock shares to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.", "PERMNO": 17351, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "COCP"}
