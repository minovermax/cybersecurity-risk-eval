{"cik": "1334478", "company": "NCI, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with information included elsewhere in this Report and other documents we file with the SEC, in your evaluation of our business. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or operating results could be materially harmed and the price of our stock could decline. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions, including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters, or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe depend on contracts with the U.S. Federal Government for substantially all of our revenue. If our relationships with U.S. Federal Government Agencies are harmed, our future revenue and operating profits would decline.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we derived substantially all our revenue from U.S. Federal Government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. For the year ended 2016, this included approximately 57% of our revenue from contracts with the DoD and Intelligence Agencies, and 43% of our revenue from contracts with Civilian Agencies. For the year ended 2015, this included approximately 60% of our revenue from contracts with the DoD and Intelligence Agencies, and 40% of our revenue from contracts with Civilian Agencies. We believe that U.S. Federal Government contracts will continue to be the source of substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future. For this reason, any issue that compromises our relationship with U.S.\nFederal Government Agencies in general, or with the DoD and Intelligence Agencies in particular, would cause our revenue to decline. Among the key factors in maintaining our relationships with U.S. Federal Government Agencies are our performance on individual contracts and task orders, the strength of our professional reputation, and the relationships of our key executives with customer personnel. In addition, if we or one of our business units were charged with or found guilty of any wrongdoing as a result of any U.S. Government investigation, the U.S. Government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. Government contracts. If our volume of U.S. Federal Government contracts were to decline for any of these reasons, our revenue and operating results could decline materially.\nWe face intense competition from many competitors that have greater resources than we do, which could result in price reductions, reduced profitability, or loss of market share.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and generally encounter intense competition to win contracts from many other firms, including mid-tier Federal contractors with specialized capabilities and large Defense and IT services providers. Competition in our markets may increase as a result of a number of factors, such as the entrance of new or larger competitors, including those formed through alliances or consolidation. These competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations resources; larger customer bases; and greater brand or name recognition than we do. These competitors could, among other things:\n\u2022\ndivert sales from us by winning very large-scale U.S. Government contracts;\n\u2022\nforce us to charge lower prices in order to win competitively awarded contracts; or\n\u2022\nadversely affect our relationships with current customers, including our ability to continue to win competitively awarded engagements where we are the incumbent.\nIf we lose business to our competitors or are forced to lower our prices, our revenue and our operating profits could decline. In addition, we may face competition from our subcontractors who, from time to time, seek to obtain prime contractor status on contracts for which they currently serve as a subcontractor to us. If one or more of our current subcontractors are awarded prime contractor status on such contracts in the future, it could divert sales from us or could force us to charge lower prices, which could cause our margins to suffer.\nWe cannot guarantee that our estimated contract backlog will result in actual revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our estimated contract backlog totaled approximately $625 million, of which approximately $139 million was funded. There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, or that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. There is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog. The actual receipt and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual receipt of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change; the program could be canceled; a contract could be reduced, modified, or terminated early; or an option that we had assumed could not be exercised. Further, while many of our U.S. Federal Government contracts require performance over a period of years, Congress often appropriates funds for these contracts for only one year at a time. Consequently, our contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work intended to be performed under the contracts will remain unfunded pending subsequent Congressional appropriations and the obligation of additional funds to the contract by the procuring agency. Our estimates are based on our experience under such contracts and similar contracts. However, there can be no assurances that all, or any, of such estimated contract backlog will be recognized as revenue.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, including remediating known material weaknesses in our internal controls as of December 31, 2016, we may not be able to report our financial results timely and accurately or prevent fraud, which could adversely affect investor confidence in our company, and in turn, our results of operations and our stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on its evaluation of those controls.\nAs disclosed in more detail in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures in Part II of this Report, we have identified material weaknesses as of December 31, 2016, in our internal controls over financial reporting resulting from our failure to maintain an effective control environment, risk assessment processes and monitoring activities. Due to these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have also concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2016.\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses that existed as of December 31, 2016, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Report present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our management has taken immediate action to begin remediating these material weaknesses, as discussed in more detail under Item 9A, Controls and Procedures in Part II of this Report, and is committed to remediating them as expeditiously as possible. However, certain remedial actions have not started or have only recently been undertaken, and while we expect to continue to implement our remediation plan through 2017, we cannot be certain as to when such remediation will be fully completed. Implementing and monitoring effective internal controls requires us to incur significant incremental expenses and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources from other activities of the business.\nIf our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, identify additional internal control deficiencies that could rise to the level of a material weakness or uncover errors in financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price. In addition, a failure to maintain effective internal controls could cause a delay in compliance with our reporting obligations, SEC rules and regulations or Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including SEC enforcement action, ineligibility for short form resale registration, the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the stock exchange on which it is listed and the inability of registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock, which could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur revenue and operating profits could be adversely affected by significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of the U.S. Federal Government.\nWe depend on continued U.S. Federal Government expenditures on Defense, Intelligence, and other programs that we support.\nFuture levels of expenditures and authorizations for those programs may decrease, remain constant, or shift to programs in areas where we do not currently provide services. Among the factors that could materially adversely affect us are the following:\n\u2022\nbudgetary constraints affecting U.S. Federal Government spending generally or specific departments or agencies in particular, and changes in fiscal policies or available funding;\n\u2022\nour dependence on our contracts with U.S. Federal Government agencies, particularly within the DoD, for the majority of our revenue;\n\u2022\na change in funding of our contracts due to bid protests;\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. Federal Government spending priorities;\n\u2022\nchanges in contract type, particularly changes from cost-plus fee or time-and-material type contracts to FFP type contracts;\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. Federal Government programs or requirements, including the increased use of small business providers;\n\u2022\nU.S. Federal Government agencies more frequently awarding contracts on an LPTA cost basis in order to reduce expenditures;\n\u2022\ndelays in the U.S. Federal Government appropriations process, or budgetary cuts resulting from Congressional committee recommendations or automatic sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011;\n\u2022\nU.S. Federal Government shutdowns (such as the shutdown that occurred during the U.S. Federal Government\u2019s 1996 and 2013 fiscal years);\n\u2022\nthe use of a Continuing Resolution to fund agencies instead of a budget appropriation, which may cause our customers within those agencies to defer or reduce work under our current contracts;\n\u2022\na failure of Congress to pass adequate supplemental appropriations to pay for an international conflict or related reconstruction efforts;\n\u2022\norganizational and consultant conflicts of interest (OCI) clauses contained in the FAR and certain of our U.S. Federal Government contracts that may limit our ability to compete for, or perform on certain other contracts (OCIs arise when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the U.S. Federal Government, impair our objectivity in performing contract work, or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage);\n\u2022\ncurtailment of the U.S. Federal Government\u2019s use of professional services providers, realignment of funds with changed Government priorities including \u201cinsourcing\u201d of previously contracted support services, and the realignment of funds to other non-defense related programs, which may reduce the amount of funds available to defense-related and other programs in our core service areas;\n\u2022\nadoption of new laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve the objectives of near-term or long-range business plans, particularly revenue growth, and the ability to realize future deferred tax assets benefits;\n\u2022\ncompetition and consolidation in the IT industry; and\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in the United States, including conditions that result from terrorist activities or war.\nThese or other factors could cause U.S. Federal Government Agencies, or prime contractors for which we are acting as a subcontractor, to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts, or elect not to exercise options to renew contracts, any of which could cause our revenue and operating profits to decline.\nIf we fail to attract and retain skilled employees or employees with the necessary security clearances, we might not be able to perform under our contracts or win new business.\nThe growth of our business and revenue depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly qualified individuals who have advanced information technology and technical services skills. These employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future. Further, obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process, and it is difficult to identify, recruit, and retain employees who already hold security clearances. If we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of these employees, our ability to maintain and grow our business could be limited. In a tight labor market, our direct labor costs could increase or we may be required to engage large numbers of subcontractor personnel, which could cause our profit margins to suffer. In addition, some of our contracts contain provisions requiring us to staff an engagement with personnel that the customer considers key to our successful performance under the contract. In the event we are unable to provide these key personnel or acceptable substitutions, the customer may terminate the contract and we may lose revenue.\nIn addition, certain U.S. Federal Government contracts require us, and some of our employees, to maintain security clearances. If our employees lose or are unable to obtain security clearances, or if we are unable to hire employees with the appropriate security clearances, the customer may terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration. As a result, we may not derive the revenue anticipated from the contract, which if not replaced with revenue from other contracts, could seriously harm our operating results.\nIf our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance and reputation as a prime contractor and our ability to obtain future business could suffer.\nAs a prime contractor, we often rely significantly upon other companies as subcontractors to perform work we are obligated to perform for our customers. As we secure more work under our GWAC and agency-specific IDIQ vehicles, we expect to require an increasing level of support from subcontractors that provide complementary and supplementary services to our offerings. In circumstances in which we are unable to identify, hire, and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees to perform the task orders we expect to win, we will need to rely on subcontracts with unrelated companies. We are responsible for the work performed by our subcontractors, even though in some cases we have limited involvement in that work. If one or more of our subcontractors fail to satisfactorily perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis, or violate U.S. Federal Government contracting policies, laws, or regulations, our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor or meet our customers\u2019 expectations may be compromised.\nWe may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontractor, our decision not to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of a subcontractor\u2019s personnel or the subcontractor\u2019s failure to comply with applicable law. If any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized. Significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating a contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability, including liability for the agency\u2019s costs of recompetition, damage our reputation, and hurt our ability to compete for future contracts and could have a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow, and financial position.\nWe are a subcontractor to other businesses on a portion of our business. If these businesses were to encounter financial difficulty, they may fail to perform their contractual obligations. Consequently, our contractual performance and reputation, as well as our financial results could be affected.\nWe are a subcontractor to other businesses on some of our contracts or task orders (approximately 7% of our revenue in 2016 was derived from contracts where we were a subcontractor). We are not in a position to control overall contract performance, and our payments are subject to the financial capabilities of the prime contractor, not the U.S. Federal Government. If our prime contractor experiences difficulties, it may not have the financial resources to perform its contractual obligations. This failure to perform could harm our reputation and affect our earnings and financial position.\nFailure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors could result in a decline in our revenue.\nIn our role as a subcontractor, we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract, and poor performance on the contract could impact our customer relationship, even when we perform as required. We expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for a portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Moreover, our revenue and operating results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated if any prime contractor or subcontractor chose to offer, directly to the client, services of the type that we provide or if they team with other companies to provide those services.\nIf we experience systems or service failure, our reputation could be harmed and our customers could assert claims against us for damages or refunds.\nWe create, implement, and maintain IT solutions that are often critical to our customers\u2019 operations. We may experience some systems and service failures, schedule or delivery delays, and other problems in connection with our work. If we experience these problems, we may:\n\u2022\nlose revenue due to adverse customer reaction;\n\u2022\nbe required to provide additional services to a customer at no charge;\n\u2022\nreceive negative publicity, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers; and\n\u2022\nsuffer claims for substantial damages.\nIn addition to any costs resulting from product or service warranties, contract performance, or required corrective action, these failures may result in increased costs or loss of revenue if customers postpone subsequently scheduled work, or cancel or fail to renew contracts.\nWhile many of our contracts limit our liability for consequential damages that may arise from negligence in rendering services to our customers, we cannot assure that these contractual provisions will be legally sufficient to protect us if we are sued. In addition, our errors and omissions and product liability insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or the insurer may disclaim coverage as to some types of future claims. As we continue to grow and expand our business into new areas, our insurance coverage may not be adequate. The successful assertion of any large claim against us could seriously harm our business. Even if not successful, these claims could result in significant legal and other costs, may be a distraction to our management, and may harm our reputation.\nInternal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our products and services to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe are also subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, intruders or hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages, or terrorist attacks. Any such failures could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims, and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our future results could be adversely affected.\nSecurity breaches in sensitive U.S. Federal Government systems could result in the loss of customers and negative publicity.\nMany of the systems we develop, install, and maintain involve managing and protecting information involved in Intelligence, national security, and other sensitive or classified U.S. Federal Government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business, damage our reputation, and prevent us from being eligible for further work on sensitive or classified systems for U.S. Federal Government customers. We could incur losses from such a security breach that could exceed the policy limits under our errors and omissions and product liability insurance. Damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work resulting from a security breach in one of the systems we develop, install, and maintain could materially impact our earnings, cash flows, and financial position.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats and other disruptions.\nAs experienced by numerous organizations across the globe, companies in the IT industry are challenged with responding to and mitigating advanced persistent threats (APTs) to their customers\u2019 systems and networking infrastructures. Though unpatched and \u201czero-day\u201d exploits are common issues, the most effective APTs begin with sophisticated socially-engineered communications (so called \u201cphishing\u201d emails) to trick users into visiting websites that can inject malicious software (malware) onto the users\u2019 local computing devices. Once a company is infected with malware, the APTs work to embed themselves further into the organization, gather information, and then slowly and stealthily extract company data to parties outside of the compromised environment (potentially for long periods of time). We combat APTs by leveraging a combination of management, operational and technical controls. These controls include our risk management, continuous monitoring methodology (and associated solution), ISO 20000 based IT processes, and our corporate Computer, Network, and Internet Security Management policies. Failures to implement and operate these controls may result in contract terminations, adverse legal actions (including potentially the payment of damages to affected parties), additional investments in security management and network/system monitoring tools, and damage to our reputation among our customers and the market at large (leading to potential loss of competitive momentum). In aggregate, failure to focus on APTs may result in a material increase in our costs, reduction in our revenues, and lessened competitive positioning (or some combination thereof).\nOur employees, agents, business partners or subcontractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could cause us to lose contracts, expose us to damages, harm our reputation and diminish investor confidence in our company.\nWe are exposed to the risk that an employee or subcontractor could commit fraud or other misconduct, including noncompliance with laws (including anti-bribery laws) or insider trading, which could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, lead to civil and criminal penalties and related stockholder lawsuits, cause us to incur significant legal fees, and damage our reputation. As discussed elsewhere in this Report, we recently discovered that our former controller had embezzled approximately $19.4 million over the period of 2010 through January 2017. This discovery has required us to incur investigative expenses, required us to restate certain past quarterly financial statements, subjected us to certain government investigations, and diverted management attention away from other activities of the business. Were we to discover additional instances of employee fraud or misconduct, we anticipate such discovery would have similar adverse effects on our business and operations.\nAn employee or subcontractor could also commit fraud or misconduct in the performance of one of our U.S. Federal Government contracts, such as by intentionally failing to comply with U.S. Federal Government procurement regulations, engaging in unauthorized activities, or falsifying time records, among other things. Employee or subcontractor misconduct could also involve the improper use of our customers\u2019 sensitive or classified information, which could result in regulatory sanctions against us, liability to third parties, and serious harm to our reputation and could result in a loss of contracts and a reduction in revenue or profitability.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls to prevent such occurrences, but it is not always possible to deter employee or subcontractor misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses. Any instances of employee or subcontractor fraud or misconduct could cause us to lose contracts, cause a reduction in our revenue, expose us to damages, harm our reputation and diminish investor confidence in our company.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, suppliers, competitors, stockholders, government agencies and others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings in this Report for further details regarding certain of these pending matters.\nOur estimates, forward-looking statements, and projections may prove to be inaccurate.\nOur earnings and profitability may vary based on the type of contracts we perform and may be adversely affected if we do not accurately estimate and manage the costs, time, and resources necessary to satisfy our contractual obligations. Revenue from some of our FFP contracts is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method with progress toward completion of a particular contract based on actual costs incurred relative to total estimated costs to be incurred over the life of the contract. Estimating costs at completion and award fees on our contracts is complex and involves significant judgment. Adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known. Adjustments in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in changes that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions, our financial results, business, and future prospects could be harmed.\nOne of our strategies is to pursue growth through acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates at prices that we consider appropriate. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of the acquisition or finance the acquisition on terms that are satisfactory to us. Negotiations with potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired business operations could disrupt our business by diverting management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations. Acquisitions of businesses or other material operations may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. We may encounter increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase the price of our acquisitions.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate companies we may acquire, our revenue and operating results could suffer. Integrating such businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties (including incompatible accounting and information management systems), may absorb significant management attention, and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our business. These difficulties of integration may require us to coordinate geographically dispersed organizations, integrate personnel with disparate business backgrounds, and reconcile different corporate cultures. In certain acquisitions, the FAR may require us to enter into Government novation agreements, a potentially time-consuming process. In addition, we may not be successful in achieving the anticipated synergies from these acquisitions, including our strategy of offering our services to customers of acquired companies to increase our revenue. We may experience increased attrition, including, but not limited to, key employees of the acquired companies during and following the integration of acquired companies that could reduce our future revenue. In addition, we may need to record write-downs from future impairments of identified intangible assets and goodwill, which could reduce our future reported earnings. Acquired companies may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence before the acquisition. In particular, to the extent that prior owners of any acquired businesses or properties failed to comply with or otherwise violated applicable laws or regulations, or failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to the U.S. Federal Government or other customers, we, as the successor owner, may be financially responsible for these violations and failures and may suffer reputational harm or otherwise be adversely affected. The discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions could cause us to incur additional expenses and cause a reduction in our operating profits.\nOur acquisitions could cause unforeseen OCIs, which could preclude us from bidding on related projects, thereby making the acquisition not as profitable as originally forecast. Additionally, the Small Business Administration requires small businesses to re-certify their size standard within 30 days of any sale or merger. It is likely that any small business we acquire will have some component of small business contracts. These regulations may affect our ability to retain some or all the contracts after the acquisition, which, in turn, may affect the value of the acquisition.\nTo the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from existing business to provide the capital we require to fund our growth strategy and future operations, we will require additional debt or equity financing. A substantial acquisition could cause us to expand or renegotiate our Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated December 13, 2010, as amended, by and among the Company and its subsidiaries, SunTrust Bank, which acted as administrative agent for the lenders, the lenders named therein and the other parties thereto (Credit Agreement). We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available if needed and, if available, that such funds will be available on acceptable terms. Any such funding could require us to incur a significantly higher interest expense. If we cannot raise additional funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future acquisitions.\nTerms of our Credit Agreement may adversely affect our ability to run our business and/or reduce stockholder returns.\nThe terms of our Credit Agreement could impair our ability to operate our business effectively and may limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities. For example, our Credit Agreement may, among other things: (i) restrict our ability to repurchase or redeem our capital stock, or merge or consolidate with another entity; (ii) limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to obtain other financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate purposes; (iii) limit our ability to dispose of our assets, to create liens on our assets, to extend credit or to issue dividends to our stockholders; and (iv) require us to maintain or satisfy specified financial ratios, which could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. Violations of one or more of these covenants, depending on the severity, could require us to renegotiate our Credit Agreement, possibly incurring significant bank fees and additional interest expense. Each of these could have a material adverse impact to our earnings, cash flow, and financial position.\nOur business commitments require our employees to travel to potentially dangerous places, which may result in injury to our employees.\nOur business involves providing services that require some of our employees to operate in countries that may be experiencing political unrest, war, or terrorism, including Afghanistan and Iraq. Certain senior-level employees or executives may, on occasion, be part of the teams deployed to provide services in these countries. As a result, it is possible that certain of our employees or executives will suffer injury, bodily harm, or death in the course of these deployments. It is also possible that we will encounter unexpected costs in connection with additional risks inherent in sending our employees to dangerous locations, such as increased insurance costs and the repatriation of our employees or executives for reasons beyond our control. We maintain insurance policies that mitigate risk and potential liabilities related to our operations. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover those claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident or incident. These problems could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nIf we are unable to maintain our current financial position and improve our growth prospects, our business could be adversely affected.\nFor us to continue to sustain our current financial position and position ourselves for growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial, and management information systems, as well as to expand, motivate, and manage our workforce. If we are unable to maintain our current financial position and position ourselves for growth while maintaining our quality of service and profit margins, or if new systems that we implement to assist us in maintaining our current financial position and positioning ourselves for growth, do not produce the expected benefits, our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe could have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of a future acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause those investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that could reduce our operating income.\nAs of December 31, 2016, goodwill accounted for approximately $33.9 million, or approximately 22%, of our recorded total assets. Under GAAP, we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If goodwill becomes impaired, we will record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, which may significantly reduce or eliminate our profits.\nOur future taxable income may not be sufficient to realize our future tax benefits which could cause our deferred tax asset to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that could reduce our net income.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $41.9 million in net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets represent temporary differences in the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in future tax deductions. Deferred tax assets are evaluated to determine if the future tax deductions will be realizable. Future realization of tax benefits ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the appropriate period that is available under the tax law. All available evidence is considered to determine if a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. As of December 31, 2016, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $0.2 million. If our future taxable income is insufficient to realize the future tax benefits and our deferred tax asset were to become impaired, we would record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our deferred tax asset is determined, which may significantly reduce or eliminate our profits.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur U.S. Federal Government contracts may be terminated by the U.S. Federal Government at any time, and if we do not replace them, our revenue and operating profits may be adversely affected.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from U.S. Federal Government contracts that typically span one or more base years and one or more option years. U.S. Federal Government Agencies have the right to decline to exercise these option periods. In addition, our contracts also contain provisions permitting a U.S. Federal Government customer to terminate the contract on short notice and for its convenience, as well as for default. A decision by a U.S. Federal Government Agency not to exercise option periods or to terminate contracts could result in a reduction of our profitability on these contracts and significant revenue shortfalls. If the U.S. Federal Government terminates a contract for convenience, we may recover only our incurred or committed allowable costs, settlement expenses, and profit on work completed before the termination. We cannot recover anticipated profit on terminated work. If the U.S. Federal Government terminates a contract for default, we may not recover even incurred amounts, and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Federal Government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source.\nU.S. Federal Government contracts contain other provisions that may be unfavorable to us.\nU.S. Federal Government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the U.S. Federal Government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts. These provisions allow the U.S. Federal Government to terminate a contract for convenience or decline to exercise an option to renew. They also permit the U.S. Federal Government to do the following:\n\u2022\nreduce or modify contracts or subcontracts;\n\u2022\ncancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts as a result of OCI clauses;\n\u2022\nclaim rights in products and systems produced by us; and\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar us from doing business with the U.S. Federal Government.\nIf the U.S. Federal Government exercises its rights under any of these provisions, our revenue and operating profits could decline.\nMany of our U.S. Federal Government customers spend their procurement budgets through Multiple Award Contracts under which we are required to compete for post-award orders or for which we may not be eligible to compete and could limit our ability to win new contracts and grow revenue.\nBudgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many U.S. Federal Government customers to increasingly purchase goods and services through agency-specific IDIQ contracts, the GSA Schedule 70 task orders, and other multiple-award and/or GWAC vehicles. These contract vehicles have resulted in increased competition and pricing pressure, requiring us to make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenue under the relevant contract vehicle. The U.S. Federal Government\u2019s ability to select multiple winners under multiple-award schedule contracts, GWACs, blanket purchase agreements, and other agency-specific IDIQ contracts, as well as its right to award subsequent task orders among such multiple winners, means that there is no assurance that these multiple-award contracts will result in the actual orders equal to the ceiling value, or result in any actual orders. We are only eligible to compete for work (task orders and delivery orders) as a prime contractor pursuant to GWACs already awarded to us. Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment could reduce our revenue. If the U.S. Federal Government elects to use a contract vehicle that we do not hold a position on, we will not be able to compete as a prime contractor.\nOur business could be adversely affected by delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us, resulting in the delay of the initiation of work.\nIn addition, most U.S. Federal Government contract awards are subject to protest by competitors. If specified legal requirements are satisfied, these protests require the U.S. Federal Government Agency to suspend the contractor\u2019s performance of the newly awarded contract pending the outcome of the protest. These protests could also result in a requirement to resubmit bids for the contract or in the termination, reduction, or modification of the awarded contract. If we are subject to delays in the startup of work on awarded contracts due to protests, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nEach of our contract types involves the risk that we could underestimate our costs and incur losses.\nWe enter into three types of U.S. Federal Government contracts for our services: T&M, cost-plus fee, and FFP. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived approximately 17%, 60%, and 23% of our revenue from T&M, cost-plus fee, and FFP contracts, respectively. If we acquire other businesses, our contract mix could change significantly, depending on the size and contract mix of the acquired businesses.\nEach of these types of contracts, to differing degrees, involves the risk that we could underestimate our cost of performance, which may result in a reduced profit or a loss on the contract for us. Under T&M contracts, we are reimbursed for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. We assume minimal financial risk on delivery of time-and-materials contracts because we only assume the risk of performing those contracts at negotiated hourly rates. However, to perform profitably under T&M contracts, we must be able to staff the contract with appropriately priced individuals. If we cannot find individuals whose fully-burdened cost is less than the contract value, we will incur a loss on the contract. Under cost-plus fee contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance based. To the extent that actual costs incurred in performing a cost-plus fee contract are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract and applicable regulations, we are entitled to reimbursement of our costs, plus a profit. However, if our costs exceed the ceiling or are not allowable under the terms of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to recover those costs. Under FFP contracts, we perform specific tasks for a fixed-price. Compared to T&M and cost-plus fee contracts, FFP contracts generally offer higher margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns. Because we assume the most risk for cost overruns and contingent losses on FFP contracts, an increase in the percentage of FFP contracts in our contract mix would increase our risk of suffering losses. Failure to properly estimate our costs for FFP contracts could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur failure to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations could cause us to lose business and subject us to a variety of penalties.\nWe must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Federal Government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on us. Among the most significant laws and regulations are:\n\u2022\nthe FAR and agency regulations supplemental to the FAR, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Federal Government contracts;\n\u2022\nthe Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. export control regulations by us or our subcontractors;\n\u2022\nthe Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Federal Government contracts; and\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations, and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data.\nMoreover, we are subject to security regulations of the DoD and other Federal Agencies that are designed to safeguard against foreigners\u2019 access to classified information. If we were to come under foreign ownership, control, or influence, our U.S. Federal Government customers could terminate or decide not to renew our contracts, and our ability to obtain new contracts could be impaired.\nThe U.S. Federal Government may revise its procurement or other practices in a manner adverse to us.\nThe U.S. Federal Government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, such as cost accounting standards. It could also adopt new contracting methods relating to GSA contracts, GWACs or other multi-award contracts, or adopt new standards for contract awards intended to achieve certain social or other policy objectives. In addition, the U.S. Federal Government may face restrictions from new legislation or regulations, as well as pressure from U.S. Federal Government employees and their unions, on the nature and amount of services the U.S. Federal Government may obtain from private contractors. These changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or contracts under which we currently perform when those contracts are up for recompete. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement, and as a result, could harm our operating results. A realignment of funds with changed U.S. Federal Government priorities, including \u201cinsourcing\u201d of previously contracted support services, and the realignment of funds to other non-Defense-related programs may reduce the amount of funds available to defense-related and other programs in our core service areas.\nAs a result of the Small Business Administration set aside program, the U.S. Federal Government may decide to restrict certain procurements only to bidders that qualify under minority-owned, small, small-disadvantaged businesses, or other such programs. As a result, we would not be eligible to perform work as a prime. In such circumstances, we compete as a subcontractor with small businesses.\nWe derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive procurement process, which may require significant upfront bid and proposal costs that could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe derive significant revenue from U.S. Federal Government contracts that are awarded through a competitive procurement process. We expect that most of the U.S. Federal Government business we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through competitive processes. Competitive procurements impose substantial costs and present a number of risks, including the substantial cost, managerial time, and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us and could reduce our profitability.\nUnfavorable results of any U.S. Federal Government audit or other investigation could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions and could harm our reputation and relationships with our customers and impair our ability to win new contracts.\nThe U.S. Federal Government, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), routinely audits and reviews our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The DCAA reviews a contractor\u2019s internal control system and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and management information systems, and the contractor\u2019s compliance with such policies. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed may be required to be refunded. Adverse findings in a DCAA audit could materially affect our competitive position and result in a substantial adjustment to our revenue and profit.\nAdditionally, we are subject to certain investigations into the Company being conducted by the SEC and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia (USAO EDVA) in connection with the recently discovered misappropriation of Company funds by our former controller, as discussed more fully in Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Report, and may in the future become subject to other U.S. Federal Government investigations into our compliance with U.S. laws and regulations.\nIf a U.S. Federal Government audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including fines, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. Federal Government Agencies. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation and competitive position if allegations of impropriety were made against us, whether or not true. If our reputation or relationship with U.S. Federal Government Agencies were impaired, or if the U.S. Federal Government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our revenue and operating profit could decline.\nOther Risks Related to Our Stock\nOur stock price is subject to volatility and could decline.\nThe stock market in general has been highly volatile. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock is likely to be similarly volatile, and investors in our Class A common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. The price of our Class A common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including those listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has, at times, been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of factors outside of our control, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe expect our revenue and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter. As a result, our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Factors that may affect our operating results include those listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and others such as:\n\u2022\nchanges in contract type and profitability;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in revenue recognized on contracts;\n\u2022\nvariability in demand for our services and solutions;\n\u2022\ncommencement, completion, or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n\u2022\ntiming of award or performance incentive-fee notices;\n\u2022\ntiming of significant bid and proposal costs;\n\u2022\ntiming of acquisition activities and the expensing of acquisition-related costs;\n\u2022\nannouncement of the commencement or results of any U.S. Federal Government audit or investigation;\n\u2022\nvariable purchasing patterns under the GSA Schedule 70 task orders, GWACs, blanket purchase agreements, and other agency-specific IDIQ contracts;\n\u2022\nstrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, and joint ventures;\n\u2022\nstrategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022\nchanges in the extent to which we use subcontractors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in staff utilization rates or penalties associated with not meeting staffing requirements; and\n\u2022\nU.S. Federal Government shutdowns or temporary facility closings. Reductions in revenue in a particular quarter could lead to lower profitability during that quarter because a relatively large amount of our expenses are fixed in the short-term. We may incur significant operating expenses during the startup and early stages of large contracts and may not be able to recognize corresponding revenue during that same quarter. We also may incur additional expenses when contracts expire, are terminated, or are not renewed.\nIn addition, payments due to us from U.S. Federal Government Agencies may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures of Government budgets to gain Congressional and administration approval in a timely manner. The U.S. Federal Government\u2019s fiscal year ends September 30. If a Federal budget for the next Federal fiscal year has not been approved by that date in each year, our customers may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved. Any such suspensions may reduce our revenue during the fourth quarter of that calendar year or the first quarter of the subsequent year. The U.S. Federal Government\u2019s fiscal year-end can also trigger increased purchase requests from customers for equipment and materials. Any increased purchase requests we receive as a result of the U.S. Federal Government\u2019s fiscal year-end would serve to increase our third- or fourth-quarter revenue but will generally decrease profit margins for that quarter, as these activities generally are not as profitable as our typical offerings.\nMr. Narang, our founder and Chairman, controls the Company, and his interests may not be aligned with yours.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Mr. Narang, our founder and Chairman, through his beneficial ownership of 4,500,000 shares of our Class B common stock and 117,659 shares of our Class A common stock, owned or controlled approximately 84% of the combined voting power and approximately 34% of the outstanding shares of the common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Narang controls the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As long as Mr. Narang beneficially owns the majority of the voting power of our common stock, he will have the ability - without the consent of our public stockholders - to elect all members of our board of directors and to control our management and affairs. Mr. Narang\u2019s voting control may have the effect of preventing or discouraging transactions involving a change in control, including proxy contests, tender offers, mergers, or other purchases of the capital stock of the Company, regardless of whether a premium is offered over then-current market prices.\nA substantial number of shares of our common stock are eligible for sale by Mr. Narang, which could cause our common stock price to decline significantly.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Mr. Narang beneficially owned 4,500,000 outstanding shares of Class B common stock and 117,659 shares of Class A common stock of the Company. Mr. Narang may, at his discretion, sell these shares in the public market, subject to applicable volume restriction and manner of sale requirements imposed on affiliates under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. The market price of our common stock could drop significantly if Mr. Narang sells his interests in the Company or is perceived by the market as intending to sell them.", "PERMNO": 90956, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "NCIT"}
