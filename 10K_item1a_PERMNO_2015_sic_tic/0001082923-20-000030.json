The first section, captioned \u201cRisks Related to Our Industry,\u201d discusses some of the risks relating to the mailing and shipping technology industry in which we operate. The second section, captioned \u201cRisks Related to Our Business,\u201d discusses some of the risks relating to our business operations. The third section, captioned \u201cRisks Related to Our Common Stock,\u201d discusses some of the risks particular to an investment in our common stock. You should carefully consider all of the following risks and the other information in this Report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) before you decide to invest in our Company or to maintain or increase your investment. The risks included in this section are not the only ones we face. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the potential impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThis Report contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about us and the Internet. See the discussion of forward-looking statements on page 1 of Part I of this Report.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nPostal reform may negatively affect, or cause disruptions to, our services and business, and could adversely affect our ability to compete and our results of operations.\nThe USPS has reached its congressionally mandated debt limit and faces ongoing fiscal liquidity issues. The USPS currently only has five of its nine presidentially appointed Governors. It has embarked on cost cutting initiatives and has asked Congress to enact various Postal Reform measures. Newly appointed Governors, including the two that were appointed in 2018 and the three that were appointed in 2019, could change the focus of cost cutting initiatives. Among the measures discussed are cutbacks in delivery schedules and locations, mail processing capability, and retail post office hours and locations. Any such changes actually approved and implemented may adversely affect the attractiveness of the USPS products and services we are able to offer our customers and could therefore seriously harm the competitiveness of our business. Additionally, absent Congressional action, any USPS fiscal crisis could interrupt basic USPS operations, as well as payments to USPS suppliers such as us, each of which could also seriously harm our business.\nRegulations and/or USPS policy or practices may cause disruptions to, or the discontinuance of our business.\nWe are subject to continued USPS scrutiny and other government regulations. The availability of our services is dependent upon us continuing to meet USPS performance specifications and regulations. The USPS could change its certification requirements or specifications for PC Postage or other programs or revoke or suspend the approval of one or more of our services or those of our third party service providers at any time. If at any time we fail to meet USPS requirements, we may be prohibited from offering our services, and our business would be severely and negatively impacted. In addition, the USPS could suspend or terminate our approval or offer services that compete against us, any of which could stop or negatively impact the commercial adoption of our services. Any changes in requirements or specifications for PC Postage could adversely affect our pricing, cost of revenues, operating results and margins by increasing the cost of providing our services.\nOur business is subject to regulation by other federal, state and foreign government agencies, and our failure to comply, or allegations thereof, could restrict our ability to generate revenue, require us to pay fines and/or disgorge certain profits, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe USPS could also decide that PC Postage should no longer be an approved postage service due to security concerns, financial difficulties within the USPS or other issues. Our business would suffer dramatically if we were unable to promptly adapt our services to any new requirements or specifications or if the USPS were to discontinue PC Postage as an approved postage method. Alternatively, the USPS could introduce competitive programs or amend PC Postage requirements to make certification easier to obtain, which could lead to more competition from third parties or the USPS itself. If we are unable to compete successfully, particularly against large, traditional providers of postage products, such as Pitney Bowes, who enter the online postage market, our revenues and operating results will suffer.\nThe USPS could decide that our customized postage products should no longer be approved products for such reasons as the belief that they present an unacceptable risk to USPS revenues, expose the USPS or its customers to legal liability, or cause public or political embarrassment or harm to the USPS in any way. If the USPS were to discontinue our customized postage products, our revenues and operating results would suffer.\nIn addition, USPS regulations may require that our personnel with access to postal information or resources receive security clearance prior to doing relevant work. We may experience delays or disruptions if our personnel cannot receive necessary security clearances in a timely manner, or at all. The regulations may limit our ability to hire qualified personnel. For example, sensitive clearance may only be provided to US citizens or aliens who are specifically approved to work on USPS projects.\nFinally, any approved USPS market test or new service that benefits us could also ultimately be suspended or cancelled by the USPS, causing disruptions to our business.\nOur operating results could be impaired if we, or the Internet generally, become subject to additional government regulation.\nChanges in the laws and regulations applicable to the Internet or us, including those relating to user privacy, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, characteristics and quality of products and services, and export controls, could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the applicability of existing laws to the Internet is uncertain with regard to many issues, including property ownership, export of specialized technology, sales tax, state income taxes, libel and personal privacy, and changes in their interpretation could similarly harm us. The application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and other online services could also harm our business.\nWe have employees and offer our services in multiple states and internationally. These or other jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each state or foreign country. Our failure to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so could subject us to taxes and penalties. Other states and foreign countries may also attempt to regulate our services or prosecute us for actual or perceived violations of their laws.\nOur business is subject to extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations including those regarding privacy, and our results of operations, financial condition and reputation may be adversely affected by the demands of compliance and/or by our liability for any failure to comply.\nOur business is also subject to laws, rules, regulations, policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate and where our customers reside, including, but not limited to, those governing privacy, data protection and consumer protection. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive, complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose overlapping and/or conflicting requirements or obligations. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws and regulations), including without limitation those discussed in this risk factor or in other risk factors, may:\n\u2022\nsubject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nresult in additional compliance and licensure requirements;\n\u2022\nincrease regulatory scrutiny of our business;\n\u2022\nrestrict our operations; and\n\u2022\nforce us to change our business practices, make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements.\nThe foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate:\n\u2022\nexpose us to significant liability;\n\u2022\nimpose significant costs;\n\u2022\nrequire us to expend substantial resources;\n\u2022\nincrease the cost and complexity of compliance;\n\u2022\ndamage our brands and business;\n\u2022\nmake our products and services less attractive;\n\u2022\nresult in the loss of customers;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to grow the business;\n\u2022\nadversely affect our results of operations; and\n\u2022\nharm our reputation.\nThe complexity of U.S. federal, state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes, among other things, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to a number of laws, rules and directives (which we refer to as \u201cprivacy laws\u201d) relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer (which we refer to as \u201cprocess\u201d) of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees (which we refer to as \u201cpersonal data\u201d) in the jurisdictions where we have operations and where our users reside. Much of the personal data that we process is regulated by multiple privacy laws and, in some cases, the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions.\nThere is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws, which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict, including with respect to evolving technologies. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and violations of privacy and data protection-related laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business. In addition, compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers. A determination that there have been violations of privacy or data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation.\nThe European Union (EU) has adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the national legislative approach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in 2018. The EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and \u20ac20 million and includes new rights such as the \u201cportability\u201d of personal data. Although the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, as has been the case under the current data protection regime, local data protection authorities (DPAs) will still have the ability to interpret the GDPR, which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Business - Our MetaPack acquisition has increased our risk profile to GDPR, and privacy and cyber security laws of California, as well as other jurisdictions, may affect our operations,\u201d below.\nThe State of California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, a privacy and cyber security law, and other jurisdictions, including other states, have enacted, or may enact their own privacy and cyber security laws. See \"Risks Related to Our Business - Our MetaPack acquisition has increased our risk profile to GDPR, and privacy and cyber security laws of California, as well as other jurisdictions, may affect our operations,\u201d below.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws.\nWe do not collect sales or consumption taxes in some jurisdictions, and if such jurisdictions successfully challenged this practice, we could be subject to liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not collect sales or consumption taxes in certain jurisdictions. An increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices that attempt to impose obligations on out-of-state or out of jurisdiction retailers to collect taxes on their behalf. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to remit taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\nCertain states have been aggressively seeking to require even those businesses that do not maintain a physical presence in such states to collect sales and use taxes, rather than relying on the consumers to pay such taxes themselves. In June 2018, the United States Supreme Court issued a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, et al. that upheld a South Dakota statute that imposes sales tax collection on an out of state seller under certain conditions that do not include physical presence in South Dakota. This, and any similar laws in other states, could result in us being required to collect state sales and use taxes in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so. This could reduce demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe discontinuation of certain financial compensation arrangements with the USPS will have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results, unless we are successful in replacing the lost revenue and profit with similar compensation from the USPS or other potential partners, of which there is no assurance.\nAs previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2018, the USPS provided a notice requiring the renegotiation of certain important financial compensation arrangements, and our negotiations with the USPS resulted in the discontinuation of the aforementioned arrangements effective December 31, 2018. As a result, and as previously disclosed, our revenue and operating results will continue to be adversely affected unless we are successful in timely replacing the lost revenue with similar compensation from the USPS or other potential partners. There is no assurance as to when, if or to what extent we may ultimately succeed in implementing mitigating strategies, all of which carry negotiation and execution risks. Unless and until we replace these lost revenues and associated profit margins, our operating results may be materially less than in previous years.\nThe USPS or other carriers could modify, discontinue or terminate agreements and other financial compensation arrangements, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nThe USPS could decide to amend, renegotiate, discontinue or terminate one or more financial compensation arrangements from which we benefit that exist now or in the future. If the USPS decides to amend, renegotiate, discontinue or terminate any of our agreements or our integration partners\u2019 agreements under which we are compensated directly or indirectly by the USPS or integration partners for shipping customers who print certain classes of postage, or our credit card cost sharing agreements which govern the allocation of credit card fees paid by the USPS and us, then our revenue and operating results would suffer. In the history of our relationship with the USPS, we have had many of these important agreements renewed only on short-term extensions and without assurances of any long-term commitments by the USPS. More recently, certain important financial compensation arrangements with the USPS were neither renewed nor extended at the end of their terms (see \"--The discontinuation of certain compensation arrangements with the USPS will have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results, unless we are successful in replacing the lost revenue and profit with similar compensation from the USPS or other potential partners, of which there is no assurance\" above). We expect continued uncertainty as to these compensation arrangements going forward, and, whether or not ultimately renewed, there could be prolonged periods where we operate without such agreements, which would have an adverse impact on our operating results. Similarly, the financial compensation arrangements we have or may enter into with other carriers may be amended, renegotiated, discontinued or terminated. If any of these financial compensation arrangements are not renewed, or if renegotiation leads to renewal on materially less favorable terms, then our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected.\nThe USPS, other carriers or our integration partners could cause discounts our customers receive to be diminished or terminated, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, reputation and competitiveness.\nThe USPS could decide to amend or terminate the discounts our customers and integration partners receive. Customers using our services receive discounted postage rates, either from Stamps.com or from integration partners that provide discounted rates, compared to USPS retail rates on certain mail pieces such as First Class letters and packages, domestic and international Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express packages, and other discounts available to high-volume shipping customers. We also earn compensation by offering customers a discounted postage rate that is provided to the customers by our integration partners. If the USPS decides to withdraw certain discounts or even remove the discounts entirely, our revenue and operating results will suffer. If the Postal Regulatory Commission decides the discounts are unlawful and require the USPS to cancel or change them, then our revenue and operating results would suffer. These discounts are subject to terms and conditions of agreements between third parties and the USPS, and there can be no assurance that our integration partners will continue to have access to such discounts or that they will continue to make them available to our customers on favorable terms or at all. Similarly, other carriers may amend or terminate the discounts our customers and/or integration partners receive now or in the future. Any disruption to our ability to provide discounts to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, reputation and competitiveness.\nStrategic business partners or carriers could modify or terminate agreements and other financial compensation arrangements, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects.\nStrategic business partners, such as the USPS, other postal services, multi-carrier software providers, e-commerce platforms, private shipping services, shipping service resellers, or others, could decide to amend, renegotiate or terminate agreements or financial compensation arrangements that exist now or in the future. For instance, if these partners amend, renegotiate or terminate agreements allowing us to integrate their services with our products and services, our revenues and operating results could suffer and our ability to attract customers that rely on these services could suffer.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against alternative methods of accessing relevant mailing and shipping services, our revenues and operating results will suffer.\nWe compete with all of the alternate ways that consumers and businesses may access mailing and shipping services from the USPS, including the following: online services available at USPS.com; USPS retail locations; USPS kiosks; multi-carrier solutions; integrated web shipping solutions such as eBay/PayPal or Amazon.com; traditional postage meters; other USPS-approved PC Postage vendors; USPS permit manifesting solutions; and commercial retail locations that sell postage or shipping services (for example grocery stores, discount warehouses, small business mailing and shipping centers, office supply chains, and others). Some of these alternative means of accessing USPS services are available with no additional markup over the face value of postage and some are available with discounted postage rates that are better than the discounts that we are able to provide to our customers. We also compete with all of the alternate ways that consumers and businesses may access the mailing and shipping services of carriers other than the USPS, including multi-carrier solutions providers. We also compete with the technology solutions available from these carriers themselves, which allow customers to access those carriers, and which are typically provided to the customers for no additional fees.\nWe may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors as they enter the market. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, greater financial, marketing, service, support, technical, intellectual property and other resources than us. As a result, our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development. This increased competition may result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and a diminished brand. We may from time to time make pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment. These actions could result in reduced margins and seriously harm our business.\nWe face competitive pressures from new technologies or the expansion of existing technologies approved for use by the USPS and other carriers. We may also face competition from a number of indirect competitors that specialize in electronic commerce and other companies with substantial customer bases in the computer and other technical fields. Additionally, companies that control access to transactions through a network or web browsers could also promote our competitors or charge us a substantial fee for inclusion. In addition, changes in postal regulations could adversely affect our service and significantly impact our competitive position. For example, in 2018, Amazon launched a delivery service that is designed to compete directly with carriers such as the USPS, UPS and FedEx. By leveraging a large customer base and substantial resources, Amazon and/or other companies may be able to win substantial market share at the expense of other carriers and the technology and service providers that support them, including the Company and its subsidiaries. We may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and the competitive pressures we face could seriously harm our business.\nIf we do not respond effectively to technological and market changes, our services and products could become obsolete and our business will suffer.\nThe development of our services, products and other technology entails significant technical and business risks. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our online operations. The Internet and the electronic commerce industry are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user and customer requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices.\nThe evolving nature of the Internet or the markets in which we operate could render our existing technology and systems obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our abilities:\n\u2022\nto develop, license or acquire leading technologies useful in our business;\n\u2022\nto enhance our existing services;\n\u2022\nto develop new services or features and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective users; and\n\u2022\nto respond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWith the growth of e-commerce, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the shipping and logistics industries is faster now than in years past. This accelerated pace of change increases uncertainty and places a greater burden on management to anticipate and respond to such changes. The increased pace of change also means that the window in which a technologically advanced or sophisticated product or service can achieve and maintain partner and consumer interest is shrinking and, to the extent we fail to timely anticipate or respond to changes in our industry, the effects of such missteps may be amplified and our business seriously harmed.\nFuture advances in technology may not be beneficial to, or compatible with, our business. Furthermore, we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our technology and systems to user requirements or emerging industry standards on a timely basis. Our ability to remain technologically competitive may require substantial expenditures and lead time. If we are unable to adapt in a timely manner and at reasonable cost to changing market conditions or user requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nOur MetaPack acquisition could be adversely impacted by Brexit.\nIn June 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" On March 29, 2017, the UK notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The UK exited the European Union on January 31, 2020, which will be followed by an 11-month transition period by which to leave the single market and customs union. Brexit has caused, and may continue to result in, significant volatility in global stock market and currency exchange rate fluctuations of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business. Ongoing changes in the EU's regulatory framework applicable to our business, including changes related to Brexit and any other changes in the composition of the EU's member states, may add further complexity to our global risks and operations.\nGiven the significant UK presence we have after acquiring MetaPack, we could be adversely impacted both by the ongoing uncertainty of the Brexit negotiations, and by the final outcome of such negotiations. In particular, any outcome that negatively impacts the ability of UK based businesses to deliver services to EU member states, or that increases the costs of such service delivery, would likely have an adverse impact on our business. For example, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries and increased regulatory complexities. These changes may adversely affect our sales, operations and financial results. Further, our operations in the UK may be adversely affected by extreme fluctuations in UK exchange rates. Moreover, the imposition of any import restrictions and duties levied on our UK services as imported for EU customers may make our service more expensive for such customers and less competitive from a pricing perspective. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear how Brexit may negatively impact the economies of the UK, the EU member states and other nations. However, any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, any of these effects may be significantly exacerbated by a Hard or Delayed Brexit, which is increasingly possible given the lack of progress in negotiations, and anticipated deadline for Brexit at the end of 2020.\nGeopolitical uncertainty, and changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, import and excise duties, taxes or other governmental rules and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are seeking to grow our revenue generated from customers located outside the U.S. and, after acquiring MetaPack, a significant portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the U.S. Risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, include:\n\u2022\npolitical instability, and the possibility of deteriorating relationships involving countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of new or modified international trade restrictions, tariffs, import and excise duties or other taxes;\n\u2022\nimport and export requirements, including restrictions on sales to certain end customers;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, including potential intervention by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) or by other applicable administrative review boards to block strategic transactions that might otherwise be in shareholders\u2019 interests;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriation of cash earned in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;\n\u2022\na less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which, among other things, can create uncertainty regarding contract enforcement, intellectual property rights and liability issues; and\n\u2022\ninadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nThe U.S. federal government or other governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. Any changes to the international trading system, or the emergence or escalation of an international trade dispute, could significantly impact our business and have a negative impact on our revenues. In addition, the U.S. and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties, tariffs and other taxes on our products in varying amounts. Any significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nAny factors that reduce cross-border trade or make such trade more difficult or expensive would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business.\nCross-border trade (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries) is subject to, and may be impacted by, foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions (e.g., the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer) are often extremely complicated in the context of cross-border trade. Changes to or the interpretation and/or application of laws applicable to cross-border trade could impose additional requirements (which may impose conflicting obligations) and restrictions on cross-border trade and increase the costs associated with cross-border trade. Any factors that increase the costs of cross-border trade or restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business.\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could sour rapidly and unexpectedly, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions and events have negatively impacted global and regional financial markets in the past, and uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values, and other factors many of which are beyond our ability to anticipate. These and other global and regional economic events and conditions could have a material adverse impact on demand for our products and services, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our customers, and integration partners and other companies with which we do business. Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, earthquakes, floods, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us or our integration partners to deliver products and services to our customers. In the event of a natural disaster, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we do not successfully attract and retain skilled personnel for permanent management and other key personnel positions, we may not be able to effectively implement our business plan.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of the members of our senior management and other key personnel. Any of these individuals can terminate his or her employment with us at any time. If we lose key employees and are unable to replace them with qualified individuals, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. In addition, our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel. We may be unable to successfully attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel. Further, we may be unable to retain the employees we currently employ or attract additional qualified personnel to replace those key employees that may depart. The failure to attract and retain the necessary personnel could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to effectively market and sell our services and products, our business will be substantially harmed and could fail.\nIn order to acquire customers and achieve widespread distribution and use of our services and products, we must develop and execute cost-effective marketing campaigns and sales programs. We currently rely on a combination of marketing techniques to attract new customers including direct mail, online marketing and business partnerships. We may be unable to continue marketing our services and products in a cost-effective manner. If we fail to acquire customers in a cost-effective manner, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nTo the extent our target customers do not, or our current customers do not continue to, accept our services, our business will be adversely affected and could fail.\nWe must minimize the rate of loss of existing customers while adding new customers. Customers cancel their subscription to our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently. Also customers may feel the costs for service are too high, they may be going out of business, or they may have other issues that are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new customers both to replace customers who cancel and to continue to grow our business beyond our current customer base. If too many of our customers cancel our service, or if we are unable to attract new customers in numbers sufficient to grow our business, our operating results will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of customers cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to seek to replace these customers with new customers.\nWe may not successfully implement strategies to increase the adoption of our services and products, which would limit our growth, adversely affect our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur continuing profitability depends on our ability to successfully implement our strategy of increasing the adoption of our services and products. Factors that might cause our revenues, margins and operating results to fluctuate include the factors described below in this section as well as:\n\u2022\nthe costs of our marketing programs to establish and promote our brands;\n\u2022\nthe demand for our services and products;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and maintain strategic distribution relationships; the number, timing and significance of new products or services introduced by us and by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, market and introduce new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe level of service and price competition;\n\u2022\nour operating expenses;\n\u2022\nUSPS regulation and policies relating to PC Postage;\n\u2022\nthe modification or termination of financial compensation arrangements with the USPS, strategic business partners and other carriers; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic factors.\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and other business relationships.\nWe provide e-commerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, shipping, mailing, and other services. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company\u2019s sales. Therefore, if the other company\u2019s offering is not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.\nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n\u2022\nimpairment of other relationships;\n\u2022\nvariability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.\nOur expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks.\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer markets, and our customers may not adopt our new offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining acquisitions and investments.\nWe have acquired a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions create risks such as:\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n\u2022\nproblems retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nadditional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating a new company\u2019s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;\n\u2022\nfor investments in which an investee\u2019s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on the investee\u2019s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and\n\u2022\nfor foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nAs a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur expansion places a significant strain on our management, operational, financial, and other resources.\nWe have significantly expanded our global operations with our MetaPack acquisition, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our services businesses. This expansion, as well as any further or other expansion, increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to meet the demands of our customers, our business will be substantially harmed and could fail.\nOur services and products must meet the commercial demands of our customers, which include small businesses, home offices, medium-size businesses, large enterprises, e-commerce merchants, large retailers and high volume shippers including warehouses, fulfillment houses and omni-channel retailers. We cannot be sure that our services will appeal to or be adopted by an ever-growing range of customers. If we are unable to ship products such as items from our supplies store in a timely manner to our customers, our business may be harmed. Moreover, our ability to obtain and retain customers depends, in part, on our customer service capabilities. If we are unable at any time to address customer service issues adequately or to provide a satisfactory customer experience for current or potential customers, our business and reputation may be harmed. If we fail to meet the demands of our customers, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nA failure to further develop and upgrade our services and products could adversely affect our business.\nAny delays or failures in developing our services and products, including upgrades of current services and products, may have a harmful impact on our results of operations. The need to extend our core technologies, and those of the companies we acquire, into new features and services and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect our ability to develop these services and features. Delays in features or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price. We cannot determine the ultimate effect these delays or the introduction of new features or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations.\nWe may implement pricing plans and promotions that may adversely affect our future revenues and margins.\nOur ability to generate gross margins depends upon our ability to generate significant revenues from a large base of active customers. In order to attract customers in the future, we may run special promotions and offers, such as trial periods, discounts on fees, offers of postage and/or supplies, and other promotions. In addition, we may offer new pricing plans for new and existing customers. We cannot be sure that customers will be receptive to future fee structures and special promotions that we may implement. Even though we have established a sizeable customer base, we still may not generate sufficient gross margins to remain profitable. In addition, our ability to generate revenues or sustain profitability could be adversely affected by the special promotions or additional changes to our pricing plans.\nWe depend on third party suppliers and outsource providers, and our business and results could be adversely affected if we fail to manage these vendors effectively.\nWe depend on third party suppliers and outsource providers for a variety of services, components and supplies, including carrier services whether offered under third party brands or our own branding, and certain asset-intensive portions of our logistics business. In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers and outsourcing vendors because doing so is advantageous due to quality, price or lack of alternative sources. If production or services were interrupted and we were not able to find alternate third party suppliers, we could experience disruptions in operations including higher service costs. If outsourcing services were interrupted, not performed, or the performance was poor, our ability to process, record and report transactions with our customers, integration partners and other counterparties could be impacted. Such interruptions in the provision of supplies and/or services could impact our ability to meet customer demand, damage our reputation and relationships and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nThird party assertions of violations of their intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nSubstantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry. Third parties may currently have, or may eventually be issued, patents upon which our products or technology infringe. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us. We may become aware of, or we may increasingly receive correspondence claiming, potential infringement of other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. We could incur significant costs and diversion of management time and resources to defend claims against us, regardless of their validity. Any associated costs (including settlement costs, judgments and legal expenses) and business distractions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, litigation in which we are accused of infringement might cause product development delays, require us to develop non-infringing technology or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements, which might not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business could be significantly harmed or fail. Any loss resulting from intellectual property litigation could severely limit our operations, cause us to pay license fees, or prevent us from doing business.\nA failure to protect our own intellectual property could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our rights in our products, services, know-how and information. We have a portfolio of issued and pending US and international patents. We also have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We plan to apply for more patents in the future. We may not receive patents for any of our patent applications. Even if patents are issued to us, claims issued in these patents may not protect our technology. In addition, a court might hold any of our patents, trademarks or service marks invalid or unenforceable. Even if our patents are upheld or are not challenged, the costs of enforcing our patents can be material, and third parties may develop alternative technologies or products without infringing our patents. If our patents fail to protect our technology or our trademarks and service marks are successfully challenged, our competitive position could be harmed. We also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties to control and limit access to, and disclosure of, our confidential information. These contractual arrangements or other steps taken to protect our intellectual property may not prove to be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of technology or deter independent third party development of similar technologies. Additionally, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our services or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nIf we are unable to protect our information technology systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation may be harmed and we could be subject to legal and/or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nWe depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems to support numerous business processes and activities. In addition, we must provide a high level of security for the transactions we execute. We rely on internally developed and third party technology to provide secure transmission of postage and other confidential information. Any breach of these security measures would severely impact our business and reputation and would likely result in the loss of customers and revenues. Furthermore, if we fail to provide adequate security, the USPS could prohibit us from selling postage over the Internet and other existing and prospective partners could refuse to work with us.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of sources, including fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquakes and similar events. Our Internet host provider does not guarantee that our Internet access will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical, electrical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. We have experienced system interruptions in the past which have not been material and may experience similar or larger system interruptions again in the future. In addition, we are susceptible to system and operational disruptions caused by substantial changes to the demand for our services and surges in the use of our service by customers. Any substantial system interruptions in the future, whatever the cause, could result in the loss of data and could completely impair our ability to generate revenues from our service.\nOur servers also periodically experience directed attacks intended to cause a disruption in service. Among other things, any breach of our information technology security could result in the unauthorized disclosure, theft or misuse of sensitive and confidential information regarding the company, our strategic partners, our customers and our employees. Any attempts to disrupt our service or our internal systems, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. Additionally, we could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, governmental inquiries, investigations or regulatory enforcement actions, our brand and reputation damaged, and we could be subject to the payment of fines or other penalties, legal claims and significant remediation costs.\nOur insurance may not be sufficient to cover expenses related to system and operational disruptions or attacks on our website, servers or internal systems. We do not presently have a full disaster recovery plan in effect to cover the loss of all facilities and equipment. We cannot be certain that our business interruption insurance coverage will be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of business interruptions.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the collection of credit card information and other customer data and the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, and our potential liability as well as the costs we may incur to mitigate such risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our customer transactions requires the collection of customer data, such as credit card information. We and other parties involved in processing customer transactions must be able to transmit confidential information, including credit card information, securely over public networks. Third parties may have the technology or knowledge to breach the security of customer transaction data. Although we have security measures related to our systems and the privacy of our customers, we cannot guarantee these measures will effectively prevent others from obtaining unauthorized access to our information and our customers\u2019 information. Any person who circumvents our security measures could destroy or steal valuable information and/or disrupt our operations.\nWe experience attempted cyber-attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our vendors, or otherwise. Such breach or unauthorized access, increased government surveillance, or attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our websites, products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.\nAny security breach could also expose us to risks of data loss, litigation and liability, and could seriously disrupt operations and harm our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, state and federal laws and regulations are increasingly enacted to protect consumers against identity theft. These laws and regulations will likely increase the costs of doing business and if we fail to implement appropriate security measures, or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws and regulations, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur MetaPack acquisition has increased our risk profile to GDPR, and privacy and cyber security laws of California, as well as other jurisdictions, may affect our operations.\nOur exposure to financial and reputational risks under the GDPR has significantly increased as a result of our expanding European operations, in particular due to our MetaPack acquisition. See \u201cRisks Related to Our Industry - Our business is subject to extensive, complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations including those regarding privacy, and our results of operations, financial condition and reputation may be adversely affected by the demands of compliance and/or by our liability for any failure to comply,\u201d above. Even without any cyber event or data breach, our compliance costs will be significantly increased.\nThe state of California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, a privacy and cyber security law, which establishes strict data protection and privacy controls and reporting requirements and increases liabilities for non-compliance. In addition, other jurisdictions, including other states, have enacted, or may enact, their own privacy and cyber security laws. Any such laws may impact our operations and the California legislation underscores the increasing risk profile of our business to both cyber events and the emerging, strict, regulatory framework governing all businesses dealing in personal data.\nThe modification or termination of agreements with our integration partners could adversely affect our business.\nWe have partnership agreements with many integration partners in the high volume shipping area of our business. These partners integrate our mailing and shipping services into their offerings and provide customers that use our services through their products. The modification or termination of any of these agreements by us or our partners could result in lost customers, reduced postage printed and lost revenue and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in payment processing fees would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur customers pay for our services using credit cards and debit cards and by use of automated clearing house payments. Our acceptance of these payment methods requires our payment of certain fees. From time to time, these fees may increase, either as a result of rate changes by the payment processing companies or as a result of a change in our business practices that increase the fees on a cost-per-transaction basis. If these fees for accepting payment methods increase in future periods, it would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA decline in our ability to effectively bill our customers by credit card and debit card would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to effectively charge our customers through credit cards and debit cards is subject to many variables, including our own billing technology and practices, the practices and rules of payment processing companies, and the practices and rules of issuing financial institutions. If we do not effectively charge and bill our customers in future periods through credit cards and debit cards, it would adversely affect our results of operations.\nPending or future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nLitigation is uncertain, and the outcome of individual cases is often not predictable with any degree of certainty. We establish loss provisions only for matters in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. If either or both of the criteria are not met, we assess whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss, or additional losses, may have been incurred. If there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred for such proceedings, we disclose the estimate of the amount of loss or possible range of loss, or disclose that an estimate of loss cannot be made, as applicable. Future litigation could involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, or sanctions, that, if awarded could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could exceed any loss provisions we may have established or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Future litigation could also involve injunctive relief, where a court could prohibit, or materially restrict, our ability to compete in certain businesses or opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results. For information concerning material litigation in which we are involved, please see the \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d section in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Report.\nCredit card fraud and our response to it could adversely affect our business.\nWe routinely receive orders placed with fraudulent credit card data. We do not carry insurance against the risk of credit card fraud, so our failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions could reduce our net revenues and our profit. We may suffer losses as a result of postage purchases placed with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved payment. If we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud, our liability for these transactions could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Further, to the extent our efforts to prevent fraudulent transactions result in our inadvertent refusal to fill legitimate business requests, we would lose the benefit of legitimate potential sales and risk the alienation of legitimate customers.\nDefault on the credit we may provide for printing postage to one or more of our larger customers could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs we acquire larger customers that require larger postage volumes to support their businesses, we offer invoicing and extend credit terms to certain of these customers to facilitate their access to postage and use of our services. If one or more of these customers were to default on amounts owed, it could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, financial flexibility, competitive position and results of operations.\nOur level of indebtedness could have significant effects on our business. For example, our current indebtedness and any other indebtedness we may incur in the future could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other elements of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and payment of dividends;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake it more likely that we experience an event of default or other event that could result in the acceleration of our obligations to repay our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our financial results as the interest rate on our current debt is subject to changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and changes in certain financial measures, and the interest rate on any indebtedness we may incur in the future may be subject to similar interest rate changes and thus could increase in future periods. The LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past, and while we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to the 2021 target date, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, and they could include an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in our interest income.\nTo service our debt and fund our other capital requirements, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash will depend on many factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash, our liquidity and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and to fund working capital, capital expenditures and investments in our business, will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. For example, this could include general and regional economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. We cannot ensure that we will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional indebtedness or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to timely effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur Credit Agreement imposes certain limitations on our ability to make dividend payments and to engage in further borrowing, which could hamper our control over liquidity.\nOur Credit Agreement, dated as of November 18, 2015 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), imposes certain requirements in order for us to make dividend payments to our shareholders. Please see the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of the \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section of this Report for additional information. Adverse changes in our financial condition and results of operations could result in the Credit Agreement prohibiting us from paying any dividends or incurring additional debt in the future.\nWe are exposed to various risks associated with the credit and capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow, and reported earnings.\nOur cash equivalents and investments may be comprised of money market, asset-backed securities and public corporate debt securities. Global credit and capital markets can be suddenly and unexpectedly impaired, such as during the 2008 global financial crisis, and there can be no assurance that such markets will recover quickly or at all. Declines in the fair value of securities in our investment portfolio could lead to an increased risk that an other-than-temporary impairment exists. Uncertainties in the credit and capital markets or credit rating downgrades on any investments in our portfolio could cause impairment to our investment portfolio, which could negatively affect our financial condition, cash flow, and reported earnings.\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional state or international tax liabilities which may adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. In addition, the application of other indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax) to a business such as Stamps.com is a complex and evolving issue, and states are increasingly seeking to assess sales tax on subscription fees. State or local authorities may attempt to collect taxes on our income based on this evolving area. The application of existing, new or future laws could have adverse effects on our business, prospects and operating results. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business.\nAmong other factors, our effective tax rate is affected by the actions of third parties that we can neither control nor accurately predict, including the market for our common stock and the occurrence and timing of exercise of options awarded under our equity incentive plans. Actions that have generated material tax deductions for us in prior periods, such as the exercise of employee stock options, may not be repeated at the same levels in future periods, and our effective tax rate may increase as a result.\nThe potential of increased deficits that may result from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and/or other economic, political or other factors that we are not able to predict, could prompt future legislative action that may increase our tax rates, modify or eliminate deductions, credits or other tax features from which we currently benefit, or otherwise cause our effective tax rate to increase. Any increase in our effective tax rate would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.\nA number of factors may increase our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits;\n\u2022\na lack of, or decrease in, exercises of employee stock options;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\nadjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n\u2022\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n\u2022\nchanges in available tax credits;\n\u2022\nchanges in our ability to secure new or renew existing tax holidays and incentives;\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards.\nTo the extent our e-commerce business expands globally, we may be subject to increased customs and regulatory risks from cross-border transactions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nTo the extent we expand our operations to include international sales generated by customers processing transactions through our platform, our international e-commerce business will be subject to significant trade regulations, taxes, and duties in the applicable jurisdictions. Our growing exposure, as well as any changes, to these regulations could potentially impose increased documentation and delivery requirements on us, increase our costs, delay delivery times, and subject us to additional liabilities, each of which could diminish our ability to compete in international markets and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nSales generated from our customers\u2019 internationally focused businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. A strengthening of the currency in which we price our products and services (currently U.S. Dollars) relative to the currencies in other countries where we do business impacts our ability to compete internationally as the cost of similar international products and services priced in other currencies improve relative to the cost of our U.S. Dollar-denominated products and services. Such an exchange rate driven increase in our prices would likely result in a decrease in international volumes, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Alternatively, if we price our international products and services sales in local currencies, a relative strengthening of the U.S. Dollar would result in lower reported revenues from such international sales.\nWe have foreign exchange risk.\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds and Euros. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and may subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. To the extent of our international operations, additional risks that could adversely affect our business, include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nmanagement distraction;\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest and economic instability;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements or government action against our services, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our services in the applicable jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nless favorable foreign intellectual property laws;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, against which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge, and which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u2022\nprofit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\ndiffering payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nlow usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;\n\u2022\ndifferent and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization requirements;\n\u2022\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion; and\n\u2022\nintegration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities in connection with companies we may acquire or control.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile, which makes it more difficult for investors to predict at what price they may be able to sell their shares, and may make us a target for securities class action litigation.\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nvariations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts investors and the financial community;\n\u2022\nsales by stockholders holding larger blocks of our stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others; and\n\u2022\nmarket volatility in general.\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price. In the past, plaintiffs have often brought securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. For example, on February 28, 2019 and March 13, 2019, we and certain of our officers were sued in putative class action lawsuits alleging violations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements, and from May 2019 through October 2019 several purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed alleging breaches of fiduciary duties by our officers and/or directors and violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, among other things. See Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings,\" below. We may be the target of additional litigation of these types in the future as well. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nSeveral provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition, which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSeveral provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation, and our bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, and the market price of our common stock could be reduced as a result. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nproviding for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022\nprohibiting us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless certain provisions are met;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nrequiring a two-thirds vote of our outstanding shares to amend our bylaws;\n\u2022\naffording the ability to call special meetings of stockholders exclusively to our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation contains certain net operating loss protective provisions (the \u201cNOL Protective Measures\u201d), which are more specifically described in our Definitive Proxy filed with the SEC on April 2, 2008. Generally, the NOL Protective Measures provide that any person, company or investment firm that wishes to become a \u201c5% shareholder\u201d (as defined in our certificate of incorporation) must first obtain a waiver from our board of directors. In addition, any person, company or investment firm that is already a \u201c5% shareholder\u201d of ours cannot make any additional purchases of our stock without a waiver from our board of directors.\nOn July 22, 2010, our board of directors suspended the NOL Protective Measures by approving a waiver from the NOL Protective Measures to all persons and entities, including companies and investment firms. As a result, our stockholders are now allowed to become \u201c5% shareholders\u201d and existing \u201c5% shareholders\u201d are allowed to make additional purchases of our stock each without having to comply with the restrictions contained in the NOL Protective Measures. Our board of directors may revoke this waiver at any time if the board deems the revocation necessary to protect against a Section 382 \u201cchange of ownership\u201d that would limit our ability to utilize future NOLs. For complete details about this waiver from the NOL Protective Measures, please see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 28, 2010.\nIf our board of directors were to revoke the existing waiver of our NOL Protective Measures so that the measures operated again to prevent new \"5% shareholders,\" then the NOL Protective Measures could be deemed to have an \u201canti-takeover\u201d effect because, among other things, they would restrict the ability of a person, entity or group to accumulate more than 5% of our common stock and the ability of persons, entities or groups now owning more than 5% of our common stock to acquire additional shares of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors. As a result, our board of directors might be able to prevent any future takeover attempt. Therefore, the NOL Protective Measures could discourage or prevent accumulations of substantial blocks of shares in which our stockholders might receive a substantial premium above market value and might tend to insulate management against the possibility of removal.\nThe USPS may object to a change of control of our common stock, which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe USPS may raise national security or similar concerns to prevent foreign persons from acquiring (or require foreign persons to divest) significant ownership of our common stock or of our Company. The USPS also has regulations regarding the change of control of approved PC Postage providers. These concerns may prohibit or delay a merger or other takeover of our Company that stockholders may consider favorable, and the market price of our common stock could be reduced as a result. Our competitors may also seek to have the USPS block the acquisition by a foreign person of our common stock or our Company in order to prevent the combined company from becoming a more effective competitor in the market for postage solutions.\nWe may expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies or technologies, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and consume resources that may be necessary to sustain our business.\nAs part of our business efforts to acquire complementary services, technologies or businesses, we may:\n\u2022\nissue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n\u2022\nuse cash that we may need in the future to operate our business; and\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or refinance existing debt that could have terms unfavorable to us or that we might be unable to repay.\nBusiness acquisitions, such as the acquisitions of PSI Systems, Inc. (Endicia), MetaPack Limited (MetaPack), ShippingEasy Group, Inc. (ShippingEasy), Auctane LLC (ShipStation) and Interapptive, Inc. (ShipWorks), also involve risks of unknown liabilities and potential litigation associated with the acquired business. In addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, including securing the services of key employees. Incurring unknown liabilities or the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could seriously harm our business.
