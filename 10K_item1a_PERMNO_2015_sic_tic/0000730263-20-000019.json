{"cik": "730263", "company": "THOR INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this filing.\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face and represent risks that our management believes are material to our Company and our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem not material may also harm our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a sudden and material negative impact on our business and results of operations, particularly during the last half of our fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. The continuation of the pandemic and the actions taken to contain the spread of the virus by various governmental entities or other actors in the areas in which we operate and in which we sell our products may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial position in future periods.\nThe severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic are hard to predict and are ever-changing. The pandemic has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our business in numerous ways, including but not limited to those outlined below:\n\u2022During the second half of our fiscal 2020, we experienced delays in obtaining certain raw material components and also experienced an overall reduction in the volume of chassis received compared to our needs, particularly related to our European operations. The operations of our suppliers within Europe, North America and elsewhere may continue to be disrupted, negatively impacting the price we are required to pay to acquire raw material inputs, or limiting our production output due to a lack of key material components in sufficient quantities.\n\u2022The geographic centrality of the North American RV industry in northern Indiana, where the majority of our facilities and many of our suppliers are located, could exacerbate supply chain, workforce and other COVID-19 related risks, should northern Indiana or any of the other areas in which we, our suppliers or our customers operate become disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\n\u2022The majority of certain chassis used in our European operations come from a limited number of facilities which, if further impacted by COVID-19, could significantly affect our supply and limit our ability to produce motorized units.\n\u2022If the pandemic worsens, or reappears in future periods, our labor force may be negatively impacted which would negatively impact our ability to produce units.\n\u2022If governmental mandates or private actor responses imposed to slow the spread of the virus are extended or reinstated in future periods, our business may be negatively impacted. For example, in March, based on employee welfare concerns and in compliance with various governmental actions, including shelter-in-place orders promulgated in Indiana and elsewhere, we temporarily suspended production at all of our North American RV production facilities and temporarily suspended a substantial portion of our European production.\n\u2022The cancellation of, or our decision to not participate in, certain upcoming retail or wholesale RV shows and general social distancing protocols may negatively impact how dealers and end customers order, view and ultimately purchase our products. Our failure, or the failure of our independent dealer body, to effectively respond to changing conditions with effective alternative sales approaches could negatively impact our sales.\n\u2022We may incur larger-than-average repurchase obligations if there is an increase in the number of financing defaults by our independent dealers.\n\u2022If the pandemic continues to negatively impact the general economy of the regions in which we operate and in which we sell our products, including an increase in the rate of unemployment and a lack of job security, retail sales of our products may decline.\n\u2022During recent periods, retail consumers in many locations were under strict shelter-in-place requirements which limited their ability to buy our products from our dealers. Moreover, the operations of our dealers were disrupted as many of them were required to close their showrooms. A return to widespread restrictions on the movement of consumers or the shutdown of retail facilities or camping or other recreational destinations could decrease the demand for our products or cause retail sales of our products to decline.\n\u2022A sustained decline in the sales of our products could cause the fair value of our tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, to decline below the carrying value on our balance sheet and thereby require an impairment charge. We are required to perform an impairment assessment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred.\n\u2022If needed in the future, we may not be able to raise capital efficiently, or at all, due to illiquidity in the global credit markets, perceived higher risk in the consumer discretionary market, perceived reduction in the value of our assets or other factors. We may also incur borrowing costs related to the pandemic that we might not otherwise incur. For example, out of an abundance of caution to maintain maximum flexibility in a period of high uncertainty, we incurred borrowings under our ABL facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which were repaid during the fourth quarter. The Company may, again, undertake additional borrowings should COVID-19 related or other circumstances merit such borrowings in the future.\n\u2022Recent increases in demand for our products, driven by the perceived safety of RV travel during the COVID-19 pandemic and a strong desire to socially distance, may dissipate if and when viable vaccines or other treatments are developed and sufficiently distributed.\n\u2022Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us, which could have a material, negative impact to our financial results and cash flows. Future actions taken by the Company to respond to the pandemic, directly or indirectly, could also result in increased costs or lower productivity.\nThe future severity of the pandemic and the extent of the negative impact it may have, directly or indirectly, on the economies that we operate in and sell into cannot be fully foreseen at this time. The longer the pandemic continues, the higher the potential that additional negative impacts on our business could occur, including those which might exacerbate many of the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive both in the United States and in Europe.\nThe industry in which we are engaged is highly competitive. There are approximately 65 RV manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada, according to RVIA and approximately 30 RV manufacturers across Europe according to CIVD. The recreational vehicle industry is generally characterized by relatively low barriers to entry, which results in numerous existing and potential recreational vehicle manufacturing competitors. Recently, a limited number of automotive manufacturers have entered the RV industry, especially in Europe, with the introduction of campervans that directly compete with our products. Also, a number of our operating subsidiaries compete with each other. Competition is based upon price, design, value, quality and service as well as other factors. Competitive pressures have, from time to time, resulted in a reduction of our profit margins and/or a reduction in our market share. Sustained increases in these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If existing or new competitors develop products that are superior to ours or that achieve better consumer acceptance or if existing competitors offer similar products at a lower net price to dealers, our market share, sales volume and profit margins may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to direct manufacturing competitors, we also compete against consumer demand for used recreational vehicles, particularly during periods of economic downturn. The availability of used recreational vehicles and the pricing differential between used and new recreational vehicles are among the primary factors which impact the competitiveness of used vehicle sales.\nFinally, we often compete against other consumer leisure, discretionary and vacation spending alternatives, such as cruises, vacation homes, timeshares or other traditional vacations and other recreational products like boats and motorcycles. Changes in actual or perceived value among these alternatives by consumers could impact future sales volume and profitability.\nOur U.S.-based operations are primarily centered in northern Indiana.\nThe majority of our U.S. operations are located in one region. The geographic centrality of the U.S. RV industry in northern Indiana, where the majority of our U.S. facilities are located, creates certain risks, including:\n\u2022Competition for workers skilled in the industry, especially during times of low unemployment or periods of high demand for RVs, may increase the cost of our labor or limit the speed at which we can respond to changes in consumer demand;\n\u2022Employee retention and recruitment challenges, as employees with industry knowledge and experience may be attracted to the most lucrative positions and their ability to change employers is relatively easy; and\n\u2022Potential for greater adverse impact from natural disasters, including a pandemic and government responses thereto, such as mandatory shut downs and shelter-in-place orders.\nOur business is both cyclical and seasonal and subject to fluctuations in sales, production and net income.\nThe RV industry has historically been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand, reflecting prevailing economic and demographic conditions, which affect disposable income for leisure-time activities. Consequently, the results of any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period.\nIn addition, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant variability in quarterly sales, production and net income as a result of annual seasonality in our business. Since recreational vehicles are used primarily by vacationers and campers, historically demand in the recreational vehicle industry generally declines during the fall and winter months, while sales and profits are generally highest during the spring and summer months. The pandemic may disrupt the historical trends in the seasonality of our business in North America and Europe. Independent dealer demand and buying patterns also impact the timing of shipments from one quarter to another. In addition, severe weather conditions in some geographic areas may delay the timing of shipments from one quarter to another. The seasonality of our business may negatively impact quarterly operating results.\nOur business is structured to quickly align production and cost structure to meet fast changing market conditions. However, if we are not able to ramp production up or down quickly enough in response to rapid changes in demand, we may not be able to effectively manage our costs, which could negatively impact operating results, and we may lose sales and market share.\nOur business may be affected by certain external factors beyond our control.\nCompanies within the recreational vehicle industry are subject to volatility in operating results due to external factors, such as general economic conditions, credit availability, consumer confidence, employment rates, prevailing interest rates, inflation, other economic conditions affecting consumer attitudes and disposable consumer income, demographic changes and political changes. Specific external factors affecting our business include:\n\u2022COVID-19, including the impact of the pandemic on our employees, dealers, retail customers and suppliers and steps taken by governments and other actors to respond to the pandemic;\n\u2022Overall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;\n\u2022Raw material and commodity price fluctuations;\n\u2022Availability of raw materials and components used in production;\n\u2022Legislative, regulatory and tax law and/or policy developments including their potential impact on our dealers and their retail customers or on our suppliers;\n\u2022Interest rate fluctuations and the availability of credit;\n\u2022Success of new and existing products and services;\n\u2022Consumer preferences;\n\u2022Independent dealer confidence and stocking levels;\n\u2022RV retail consumer demographics;\n\u2022Employment and wage trends;\n\u2022Consolidation of independent RV dealerships;\n\u2022Consolidation of RV suppliers;\n\u2022Global, domestic or regional financial turmoil;\n\u2022Natural disasters;\n\u2022Relative or perceived safety, cost, availability and comfort of recreational vehicle use versus other modes of travel, such as car, cruise ships, air or rail travel; and\n\u2022General economic, market and political conditions, including war, terrorism and military conflict.\nThe loss of our largest independent dealer could have a significant effect on our business.\nSales to FreedomRoads, LLC accounted for approximately 15.0% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2020. During recent years, FreedomRoads, LLC has acquired a number of formerly independent RV dealerships which has impacted our sales to FreedomRoads, LLC. Future consolidation of dealerships by FreedomRoads, LLC could impact our sales, concentration of sales to this key dealer and our exposure under repurchase obligations.\nThe loss of this dealer could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of FreedomRoads, LLC could negatively impact our sales and accounts receivable and could trigger repurchase obligations under our repurchase agreements.\nFuel shortages, or high prices for fuel, could have a negative effect on sales of our recreational vehicles.\nGasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of our vehicles or the vehicles which tow our products. Shortages or rationing of gasoline and diesel fuel, and significant, sudden increases in the price of fuel have had a material adverse effect on the recreational vehicle industry as a whole in the past and could have a material adverse effect on our business in the future.\nBusiness acquisitions pose integration risks.\nOur growth has been both internal and by acquisition. Business acquisitions, joint ventures and the merger or combination of subsidiaries within Thor, pose a number of potential integration risks that may result in negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The pace and significance of acquisitions; the integration of acquired companies, assets, operations and joint venture arrangements and the merger of subsidiaries within Thor involve a number of related risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022The diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to various transaction and integration activities;\n\u2022The potential for disruption to existing operations and plans;\n\u2022The assimilation and retention of employees, including key employees;\n\u2022Risks related to transacting business in new geographies, regulatory environments or product categories in which we are unaccustomed, including but not limited to: foreign currency exchange rate changes, expanded macro-economic risks due to operations in and sales to a wide base of countries, political and regulatory exposures to countries in which we formerly did not do business, different employee/employer relationships, including the existence of workers' councils and labor organizations, new product categories and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022The ability of our management teams to manage expanded operations, including international operations, to meet operational and financial expectations;\n\u2022The integration of departments and systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records, controls and procedures;\n\u2022The adverse impact on profitability if expanded or combined operations do not achieve expected financial results or realize the synergies and other benefits expected;\n\u2022The potential loss of, or adverse effects on, existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022The assumption of liabilities of the acquired businesses, which could be greater than anticipated;\n\u2022The potential adverse impact on operating results due to the use of estimates, which are subject to significant management judgment, in the accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-offs of significant amounts of goodwill and other assets; and\n\u2022The potential adverse impact of not achieving the originally intended financial potential from the sharing of best practices, including product development and synergies, among other factors, due to current restrictions on international travel which limits the ability of our North American and European employees and management personnel from having face-to-face meetings and collaborating together.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sources, which creates additional uncertainty.\nCombined sales from the United States to foreign countries (predominately Canada) and sales from our foreign subsidiaries to countries other than the U.S. (predominately within the European Union) represent approximately 35.2% of Thor\u2019s consolidated sales for fiscal 2020. These non-U.S. sales create the potential for numerous risks which could impact our financial operating results, including foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties, and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in supply or distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and various employee work agreements, as well as economic and social instability. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, or tax laws that affect this process may change.\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere. Negative impacts may include, among others:\n\u2022Creating uncertainty regarding any new or modified trade arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union and/or other countries;\n\u2022The risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union; or\n\u2022The risk that the Euro as the single currency of the Eurozone could cease to exist.\nAny of these or other negative developments, or the perception that negative developments are likely to occur, could affect economic growth or business activity in the United Kingdom or the European Union, and could result in the relocation of businesses, cause business interruptions, lead to economic recession or depression and impact the stability of the financial markets, availability of credit, currency exchange rates, interest rates, financial institutions and political, financial and monetary systems. These developments could, in turn, affect our businesses, liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nGlobal political uncertainty and shifts pose risks of volatility in global markets, which could affect our operations and financial results. Changes in U.S. policy regarding foreign trade or manufacturing may create negative sentiment about the U.S. among non-U.S. dealers, end customers, employees, or prospective employees, all of which could adversely affect our business, sales, hiring, and employee retention. Our success in international markets will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, which could materially impact our international operations or the business as a whole.\nThe Company\u2019s debt arrangements may make us more sensitive to the effects of economic downturns, and provisions in our debt agreements could constrain the options available to us to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nWe incurred and assumed various debt obligations as a result of the EHG acquisition on February 1, 2019. In conjunction with the acquisition, we entered into a term loan agreement with USD and EUR tranches ($1.4 billion and \u20ac618 million, respectively) and a $750 million ABL. We also assumed various existing debt obligations from EHG as of the acquisition date. Our level of debt impacts our profit before tax and cash flow because of the interest expense and periodic payments. In addition, our debt level could impair our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, or increase borrowing costs on future debt, and may have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to repay indebtedness and placing us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with lower debt obligations.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service, capital investment and working capital requirements, we may need to fund those requirements with borrowings from the ABL, or reduce or cease our payments of dividends, we may be unable to repurchase our shares or we may need to seek additional financing or sell assets.\nFurthermore, our credit facilities contain certain provisions that limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry, including limitations on our ability to:\n\u2022Declare dividends or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022Prepay or purchase other debt;\n\u2022Incur liens;\n\u2022Make loans, guarantees, acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022Incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022Amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements;\n\u2022Engage in mergers, acquisitions or asset sales; and\n\u2022Engage in transactions with non-loan party affiliates.\nFinally, certain of our variable rate debt uses the London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives. LIBOR has been the subject of recent proposals for reform, and it is currently expected that LIBOR will be discontinued after 2021. While all of our material financing arrangements indexed to LIBOR provide procedures for determining an alternative base rate in the event that LIBOR is discontinued, there can be no assurances as to whether such an alternative base rate will be more or less favorable than LIBOR. We intend to monitor developments with respect to LIBOR reform and will work to minimize the impact of any LIBOR transition. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nChanges in market liquidity conditions, credit ratings and other factors may impact our access to future funding and the cost of debt.\nSignificant changes in market liquidity conditions and changes in the Company's credit ratings could impact our access to future funding, if needed, and funding costs, which could negatively impact the Company's earnings and cash flows. If general economic conditions deteriorate or capital markets become more volatile, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, future funding, if needed, could be unavailable or insufficient. A debt crisis, particularly in the United States or Europe, could negatively impact currencies, global financial markets, social and political stability, funding sources, availability and costs, asset and obligation values, customers, suppliers, demand for our products, and our operations and financial results. Financial market conditions could also negatively impact dealer or retail customer access to capital for purchases of the Company's products and customer confidence and purchase decisions.\nOur business depends on the performance of independent dealers and transportation carriers.\nWe distribute all of our North American and the majority of our European products through a system of independent, non-franchise authorized dealers, many of whom sell products from competing manufacturers. The Company depends on the capability of these independent authorized dealers to develop and implement effective retail sales plans to create demand among retail purchasers for the products that the dealers purchase from the Company. If the Company\u2019s independent dealers are not successful in these endeavors, then the Company may be unable to maintain or grow its revenues and meet its financial expectations. The geographic coverage of our independent dealers and their individual business conditions can affect the ability of our authorized dealers to sell our products to consumers. If our independent dealers are unsuccessful, they may exit or be forced to exit the business or, in some cases, the Company may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealerships. As a result, the Company could face additional adverse consequences related to the termination of independent dealer relationships. For example, the unplanned loss of any of the Company\u2019s independent dealers could lead to inadequate market coverage of our products. In addition, recent consolidation of independent dealers, as well as the growth of larger, multi-location dealers, may result in increased bargaining power on the part of independent dealers.\nThor currently owns a majority position in three dealerships within Europe. Beyond the three majority-owned dealerships, all other dealer relationships are with independently owned and managed dealerships. Given the independent nature of these dealers, they maintain control over which manufacturers, and which brands, they will do business with, often carrying more than one manufacturer\u2019s products. Independent dealers can, and do, change which brands and which manufacturers they sell.\nIf our products are not perceived by the independent dealers as being desirable and profitable for them to carry, the dealers may terminate their relationship with our operating subsidiaries or may drop certain of our brands, which would in turn adversely affect our sales and profit margins if we are unable to replace those dealers.\nOur products are generally delivered to our independent dealers via a system of independent transportation contractors. The network of carriers is limited and, in times of high demand and limited availability, can create risk in, and disruption of, our distribution channel. The network of carriers may also be negatively impacted by the pandemic. If the pandemic worsens in the regions in which we operate and sell into, the transportation contractors may have difficulty finding drivers who are willing to deliver in those regions, or governmental agencies or other actors may restrict movement of goods in those regions. In March and April, in particular, based on welfare concerns for individuals and in compliance with various governmental actions, including shelter-in-place orders, we experienced disruptions in the transportation of our units from our production facilities to dealer retail facilities in both North America and Europe.\nOur business is affected by the availability and terms of financing to independent dealers and retail purchasers.\nGenerally, independent recreational vehicle dealers finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions. A decrease in the availability of this type of wholesale financing, more restrictive lending practices or an increase in the cost of such wholesale financing can prevent independent dealers from carrying adequate levels of inventory, which limits product offerings and could lead to reduced demand. Two major floor plan financial institutions held approximately 58% of our portion of our independent dealers\u2019 total floored dollars outstanding at July 31, 2020. In the event that either of these lending institutions limit or discontinue dealer financing, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSubstantial or sudden increases in interest rates and decreases in the general availability of credit have had an adverse impact on our business and results of operations in the past and may do so in the future. Further, a decrease in availability of consumer credit resulting from unfavorable economic conditions, or an increase in the cost of consumer credit, may cause consumers to reduce discretionary spending which could, in turn, reduce demand for our products and negatively affect our sales and profitability.\nChanges in consumer preferences for our products, or our failure to gauge those preferences, could lead to reduced sales or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nWe cannot be certain that historical consumer preferences for recreational vehicles in general, and our products in particular, will remain consistent. Recreational vehicles are generally used for recreational purposes, and demand for our products may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers\u2019 leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern or taste. Similarly, an overall decrease in consumer leisure time may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products.\nConsumer preferences in vehicles and automotive manufacturers' responses to those preferences and governmental mandates could also result from changes in consumer preferences for recreational vehicles or the types of recreational vehicles preferred. These changes could include shifts to smaller vehicles, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles or other unanticipated changes.\nOur ability to remain competitive depends heavily on our ability to provide a continuing and timely introduction of innovative product offerings. We believe that the introduction of new features, designs and models will be critical to the future success of our recreational vehicle operations. Managing frequent product introductions poses inherent risks. Delays in the introduction or market acceptance of new models, designs or product features could have a material adverse effect on our business. Products may not be accepted for a number of reasons, including changes in consumer preferences or our failure to properly gauge consumer preferences. Further, we cannot be certain that new product introductions will not reduce revenues from existing models and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our revenues may be adversely affected if our new models and products are not introduced to the market on time or are not successful when introduced. Finally, our competitors\u2019 new products may obtain better market acceptance or render our products obsolete, and/or new technological advances could disrupt our industry.\nIf the frequency and size of product liability and other claims, including those related to the pandemic, against us increase, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe are subject, in the ordinary course of business, to litigation involving product liability and other claims against us, including, without limitation, wrongful death, personal injury and warranties. In North America, we generally self-insure a portion of our product liability and other claims and also purchase product liability and other insurance in the commercial insurance market. In North America, upon exhaustion of relatively higher deductibles or retentions, we maintain a full line of insurance coverage. In Europe, we generally fully insure similar risks with insurance offering relatively low deductibles or premiums. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us. Any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Any increase in the frequency and size of claims, as compared to our experience in prior years, may cause the premium that we are required to pay for insurance to increase significantly and may negatively impact future self-insured retention levels. It may also increase the amounts we pay in punitive damages, not all of which are covered by our insurance.\nAs a result of the pandemic, we may be subject to additional litigation, for which we would generally not have insurance coverage.\nAn introduction of new products into the marketplace or enhanced standard warranty coverage of our products, may result in expenses that we did not anticipate, which, in turn, could result in reduced earnings.\nThe introduction of new models, floor plans and features are critical to our future success. We may incur unexpected expenses, however, when we introduce new models, floor plans or features. Unexpected engineering or design flaws have resulted in recalls and increased warranty claims in the past and could be incurred in the future. The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings. Estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of product sale to reflect our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products. An increase in actual warranty claims costs as compared to our estimates, due to either the introduction of new products or extended warranty coverage, could result in increased warranty reserves and expense which could have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nOur chassis supply, and therefore sales, may be impacted by ongoing compliance requirements with existing emissions standards by the chassis suppliers, in both the U.S. and Europe. In addition, the implementation of new European emissions standards may result in a negative impact to our chassis supply.\nWe obtain motorized chassis from a number of different chassis suppliers who are required to comply with strict emission standards. As governmental agencies revise those standards, the chassis manufacturers must comply within the timeframes established. Uncertainties created by continued emission standards compliance requirements or the adoption of revised emission standards include the ability of the chassis manufacturer to comply with such standards on a timely and ongoing basis as well as the ability to produce sufficient quantities of compliant chassis to meet our demand. In the past, certain chassis manufacturers have experienced difficulties in meeting one or both of these requirements. In addition, revisions to chassis by the suppliers often impact our engineering and production processes and may result in increased chassis cost. Currently, certain chassis used in our European production are facing revised emission standards which may negatively impact our ability to produce certain European motorized RVs and could also impact consumer buying patterns if consumers do not embrace the new chassis or if the cost impact is not accepted, all of which could have an adverse impact on our sales and earnings.\nPrior to the EHG acquisition, EHG was a privately-held company and its ongoing obligations arising from being a part of a public company may require significant additional resources and management attention.\nAs a public company, Thor Industries, Inc., is required to comply with U.S. GAAP financial reporting, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\"), the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. As such, EHG, as a subsidiary of a public company, has established and is required to maintain effective disclosure controls as well as internal controls and procedures for financial reporting under U.S. GAAP. Current and ongoing compliance efforts may be costly and may divert the attention of management. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures and functions that have been integrated, or enhanced at EHG, particularly those related to the implementation of internal controls for SOX compliance. The maintenance of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs and time delays. These incremental costs may exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the realization of efficiencies related to the combination of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs.\nOur repurchase agreements with floor plan lenders could result in increased costs.\nIn accordance with customary practice in the recreational vehicle industry, particularly within North America, upon the request of a lending institution financing an independent dealer\u2019s purchase of our products, we will generally execute a repurchase agreement with the lending institution. Repurchase agreements provide that, typically for a period of up to 18 months after a recreational vehicle is financed and in the event of default by the dealer, we will repurchase the recreational vehicle repossessed by the lending institution for the amount then due, which is usually less than 100% of the dealer\u2019s cost.\nIn addition to the guarantee under these repurchase agreements, we may also be required to repurchase inventory relative to dealer terminations in certain states in accordance with state laws or regulatory requirements. The difference between the gross repurchase price and the price at which the repurchased product can then be resold, which is typically at a discount to the original sale price, is an expense to us. Thus, if we are obligated to repurchase a substantially greater number of recreational vehicles, or incur substantially greater discounting to resell these units in the future, those circumstances would increase our costs. In difficult economic times this amount could increase significantly compared to recent years.\nSimilar repurchase obligations also exist for certain accounts receivable from sales to independent dealer customers of our European operations that have been sold to third-party finance companies that provide financing to those dealers. These sold receivables do not meet the definition of a true sale, mainly due to this repurchase obligation, and are therefore recorded as an asset with an offsetting liability balance recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor some of the components used in production, we depend on a small group of suppliers and the loss of any of these suppliers, or the disruption of the operations of these suppliers due to COVID-19 or for other reasons, could affect our ability to obtain components timely or at competitive prices, which would decrease our sales and profit margins. Additionally, continued consolidation of our major suppliers further limits alternative supply sources, which could increase costs and decrease our sales and profit margins. Finally, certain raw material components may be sourced from countries where we do not have operations, and delays in obtaining these components, along with added tariffs, could result in increased costs and decreased sales and profit margins.\nWe depend on timely and sufficient delivery of components from our suppliers. Many components are readily available from a variety of sources. However, certain key components are currently produced by only a small group of suppliers that have the capacity to supply large quantities, primarily occurring in the case of: 1) motorized chassis, where there are a limited number of chassis suppliers, and 2) windows and doors, towable frames and slide-out mechanisms, axles and upholstered furniture for our recreational vehicles, where LCI Industries is a major supplier for these items within the North American RV industry.\nThe recreational vehicle industry as a whole has, from time to time, experienced shortages of motorized chassis due to the concentration or allocation of available resources by suppliers of these chassis. Historically, in the event of an industry-wide restriction of supply, suppliers have generally allocated chassis among us and our competitors based on the volume of chassis previously purchased. If certain suppliers were to discontinue the manufacturing of chassis suitable for our use for our range of motorhome products, or if, as a group, our chassis suppliers significantly reduced the availability of chassis to the industry, our business would be adversely affected. Similarly, shortages at, or production delays or work stoppages by the employees of chassis suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our sales. Additionally, the inability of chassis suppliers to comply timely with new or enhanced emission or other compliance requirements could adversely affect supply. If the condition of the auto industry were to significantly deteriorate, that deterioration could also result in supply interruptions and a decrease in our sales and earnings while we obtain replacement chassis from other sources.\nFollowing the COVID-19 related shut-down we experienced in our third fiscal quarter, during our fourth quarter we began to experience certain supply constraints and intermittent, short-term delays related to the delivery of certain component parts, including chassis, that are necessary to the production of our units. Through July 31, 2020 those disruptions were generally short-term in nature and limited in scope. We managed to continue production by shifting our production schedules, securing alternative supplies of the needed parts and taking other proactive actions. Subsequent to July 31, 2020, due to the heightened demand within the RV industry and other related industries that utilize some of the same component parts, we continue to face supply constraints of various component items. This situation is fluid, with the items experiencing shortages changing frequently as disruptions caused by COVID-19 are impacting the entire supply chain as well as the transportation of those items. If the supply constraints become more significant, longer term in nature or are not limited in scope, if industry demand continues to increase faster than the suppliers can respond or if other factors were to impact the suppliers\u2019 ability to supply our production needs, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nContinued consolidation within our major supplier base may also inhibit our ability to source from alternative suppliers and could result in increased component costs, which may result in decreased margins or higher wholesale product costs, which could result in decreased sales.\nIn addition, certain RV components are sourced from countries where we do not currently have operations. Changes in trade policy and resulting tariffs that have or may be imposed, along with port, production or other delays, could cause increased costs for, or shortages of, certain RV components or sub-components. We may not be able to source alternative supplies as necessary without increased costs or at all. If alternatives are not readily available, that unavailability could lead to potential decreases in our sales and earnings.\nFinally, as is standard in the industry, arrangements with chassis and other suppliers are generally terminable at any time by either our Company or the supplier. If we cannot obtain an adequate supply of chassis or other key components, this could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\nCOVID-19 impacts may serve to exacerbate the above described risks.\nOur products and services may experience quality problems from time to time, including from vendor-supplied parts, that could result in decreased sales and gross margin and could harm our reputation.\nOur products contain thousands of parts, many of which are supplied by a network of approved vendors. As with all of our competitors, defects may occur in our products, including those purchased from our vendors. We cannot assure you that we will detect all such defects prior to distribution of our products. In addition, although we endeavor to compel our suppliers to maintain appropriate levels of insurance coverage, we cannot assure you that if a defect in a vendor-supplied part were to occur that the vendor would have the ability to financially rectify the defect. Failure to detect defects in our products, including vendor-supplied parts, could result in lost revenue, increased warranty and related costs and could harm our reputation.\nOur business is subject to numerous national, regional, federal, state and local regulations in the various countries in which we operate and/or sell our products.\nOur operations are subject to numerous national, regional, federal, state and local regulations governing the manufacture and sale of our products, including various vehicle and component safety and compliance standards. In various jurisdictions, governmental agencies require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles which contain certain hazards or defects. Any recalls of our vehicles, voluntary or involuntary, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could harm our reputation. Additionally, changes in policy, regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nOur U.S. operations are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation and marketing of motor vehicles, including so-called \u201clemon laws.\u201d U.S. federal and state, as well as various European laws and regulations, impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight, length and width of motor vehicles that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions. U.S. federal and state, as well as various European, authorities have environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal which affect our business and operations.\nFurther, certain other U.S. and European laws and regulations affect the Company\u2019s activities. Areas of our business affected by such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, labor, advertising, real estate, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property, tax, import and export duties, tariffs, anti-corruption, anti-competition, environmental, privacy, health and safety. Compliance with these laws and others may be onerous and costly, at times, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, which further complicates compliance efforts. Violations of these laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties, including restraints on our export or import privileges, monetary fines, criminal or civil proceedings and regulatory or other actions that could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operations are subject to numerous labor and employment laws and regulations, and violations of those laws and regulations could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe are subject, in the ordinary course of business, to litigation and claims arising from numerous labor and employment laws and regulations, including potential class action claims arising from alleged violations of such laws and regulations. Any liability arising from such claims would not ordinarily fall within the scope of our insurance coverages. An adverse outcome from such litigation could have a material effect on operating results.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy could result in retaliatory trade policies by one or more U.S. trading partners.\nThe imposition of tariffs on certain products imported into the United States has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries. New and/or increased tariffs by the United States and/or by other countries could subject the Company to increased costs for RV components that are imported into the United States. Increased costs for imported RV components could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, may result in lower margins on products sold.\nAs a publicly-traded company, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange which entail compliance and disclosure risks as well as the potential for increased costs.\nFailure as a public company to comply with relevant rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the New York Stock Exchange could have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, amendments to these rules or regulations and the implementation of new rules or regulations could increase compliance, reporting, or other operating or administrative costs, and therefore could have an adverse impact on our business.\nAs a public company, we may be required to disclose certain information that may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain of our competitors.\nInterruption of information systems service or misappropriation or breach of our information systems could cause disruption to our operations, disclosure of confidential or personal information or cause damage to our reputation.\nOur business relies on information systems and other technology (\u201cinformation systems\u201d) to support aspects of our business operations, including but not limited to, procurement, supply chain management, manufacturing, design, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems to accumulate, analyze and report our operational results. In connection with our use of information systems, we obtain, create and maintain confidential and personal information. Additionally, we rely upon information systems in our marketing and communication efforts. Due to our reliance on our information systems, especially in the wake of the pandemic and the increase in the number of employees working remotely, we have established various levels of security, backup and disaster recovery procedures. Our business processes and operations may, however, be negatively impacted in the event of a substantial disruption of service or cyber-attacks.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related-government guidance or directives, we have, in the past, required or encouraged certain office-based employees to work remotely and may quickly adjust or reinstate such requirements in the future in response to pandemic developments. We may experience reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines and heightened cybersecurity risks as a result of remote work policies and rapid changes to such policies.\nThe methods and technologies used to obtain unauthorized access to our information systems are constantly changing and may be difficult to anticipate. While we have implemented and regularly review security measures and processes designed to prevent unauthorized access to our information systems, we may not be able to anticipate and effectively prevent unauthorized access or data loss in the future. The misuse, leakage, unauthorized access or falsification of information could result in a violation of privacy laws, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") and California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), and damage to our reputation which could, in turn, have a significant, negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\nOur intellectual property, including our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of our value. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property against infringement and misappropriation by defending our intellectual property rights. To protect these rights, we rely on intellectual property laws of the U.S., Germany, Canada, and other countries, as well as contractual and other legal rights. We seek to acquire the rights to intellectual property necessary for our operations. However, our measures may not be successful in any given instance, particularly in countries outside the U.S. We endeavor to protect our rights; however, third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights. We may be forced to take steps to protect our rights, including through litigation, which could result in a diversion of resources.\nThe inability to protect our intellectual property rights could result in competitors undermining the value of our brands by, among other initiatives, manufacturing and marketing similar products, which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations. Moreover, competitors or other third parties may challenge or seek to invalidate or avoid the application of our existing or future intellectual property rights that we receive or license. The loss of protection for our intellectual property could reduce the market value of our brands and our products and services, lower our profits, and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operation.\nWe also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign, reengineer, or rebrand our products, if feasible, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property or damage our reputation. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe could incur asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets.\nWe have a material amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. At least annually, we review goodwill for impairment. Long-lived assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, a non-cash impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Our determination of future cash flows, future recoverability and fair value of our long-lived assets includes significant estimates and assumptions. Changes in those estimates or assumptions or lower-than-anticipated future financial performance may result in the identification of an impaired asset and a non-cash impairment charge, which could be material. Any such charge could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to meet our manufacturing workforce needs is crucial.\nWe rely on the existence of an available, qualified workforce to manufacture our products. Competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified employees to meet current or future manufacturing needs at a reasonable cost, or at all. Within our European-based operations, we are subject to employee contracts, Works Councils and certain labor organizations. Any disruption in our relationships with these third-party associations, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees to meet current or future manufacturing needs at a reasonable cost, or at all.\nWe could be impacted by the potential adverse effects of union activities.\nWhile our European-based operations are subject to employee contracts, Works Councils and certain labor organizations, none of our North American employees are currently represented by a labor union. Unionization of any of our North American facilities could result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. We are, directly or indirectly, dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers, chassis suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, or financial condition.\nOur operations are dependent upon the services of our executive management and other key individuals, and their loss could materially harm us.\nWe rely upon the knowledge, experience and skills of our executive management and other key employees to compete effectively in our business and manage our operations. Our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain executive management, key employees and other qualified personnel. Upon the departure of such employees, our success may depend upon the existence of adequate succession plans. The loss of our executive management or other key employees or the failure to attract or retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on us in the event that our succession plans prove inadequate.\nProduction efficiency related to new facilities may not be realized or we may incur unanticipated costs or delays that could adversely affect operating results.\nThe development and/or expansion of certain products and models may require the construction, improvement, re-configuration, relocation or expansion of production facilities. These development and expansion activities may be delayed, or we may incur unanticipated costs or not achieve the intended efficiencies, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur sales may be impacted by certain currency fluctuations\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. based subsidiaries have expenses and sales denominated in U.S. dollars. Sales by our U.S. dollar-based subsidiaries into the Canadian market are subject to currency risk as devaluation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar may negatively impact U.S. dollar sales into Canada. With the acquisition of EHG, the Company has Euro-denominated assets which are subject to changes in the Euro and U.S. dollar currency rate. To offset a portion of this currency risk, the acquisition was partially funded through a Euro-denominated Term Loan B which provides an economic hedge.\nEHG's expenses are predominantly denominated in Euro. EHG\u2019s sales are denominated in Euro, with the exception of sales in the U.K. market, where sales are denominated in Pound Sterling. The Company has used foreign currency forward contracts to help manage (i.e., partially hedge) certain foreign exchange rate exposures related to anticipated sales transactions in Pound Sterling with financial instruments whose maturity date, along with the realized gain or loss, occurs on or near the execution of the anticipated transaction. At July 31, 2020, the Company did not have any foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. Within EHG there are assets held in non-Euro currencies, with most of these assets related to the RV rental business. Where possible, these assets have been funded by debt in the local currency which economically offsets the underlying currency risk.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in achieving their purposes.\nOur policies, procedures, controls and oversight to monitor and manage our enterprise risks may not be fully effective in achieving their purpose and may leave exposure to identified or unidentified risks. Past or future misconduct by our employees or vendors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm. The Company monitors its policies, procedures and controls; however, our policies, procedures and controls may not be sufficient to prevent all forms of misconduct. We review our compensation policies and practices as part of our overall enterprise risk management program, but it is possible that our compensation policies could incentivize inappropriate risk taking or misconduct. If such inappropriate risk taking or misconduct occurs, it is possible that it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our financial condition.\nChanges to our investment and capital allocation strategies or other facets of our strategic plan may be made.\nOur strategic plan guides activities such as our level of debt, pace of debt repayment, timing and extent of new debt, utilization of available cash, prioritization of capital expenditures and acquisition activity. Based on market conditions, opportunities and perceived risks, we could change or alter such activities and priorities. These changes could materially impact our overall business including future operating results, cost structure or liquidity.\nIncreases in healthcare, workers compensation or other employee benefit costs could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWithin our U.S. based operations, the Company incurs significant costs with respect to employee healthcare and workers compensation benefits. The Company is self-insured for these employee healthcare and workers compensation benefits up to certain defined retention limits. If costs related to these or other employee benefits increase as a result of increased healthcare costs in the U.S., increased utilization of such benefits as a result of increased claims, new or revised U.S. governmental mandates or otherwise, our operating results and financial condition may suffer. Within our European-based operations, the Company incurs significant costs with respect to employee benefits which are largely governed by country and regional regulations. New or revised governmental mandates may cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer.\nChanges in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company's domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among and the applicable tax rates in these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate or sell into may increase as a means of funding the significant cost of governmental stimulus measures enacted to assist and protect individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States or other governmental authorities may impose new income taxes or indirect taxes or revise interpretations of existing tax rules and regulations. Further, the outcome of future elections and the associated political party with power to enact legislation could make tax increases more likely and more severe.\nOur estimated effective income tax rate could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in statutory rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. If the Company's effective tax rate was to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire our Company and could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains certain supermajority voting provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of our Company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors, amend our Restated Certificate of Incorporation or take other corporate actions.\nWe are also subject to certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law that could delay, deter or prevent us from entering into an acquisition, including provisions which prohibit a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder unless specific conditions are met. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may deprive investors of an opportunity to sell shares at a premium over prevailing prices.\nOur stock price may fluctuate in response to various conditions, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market, in general, experiences volatility that has often been unrelated to the underlying operating performance of companies. If this volatility continues, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly, independent of our actual operating performance. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022Development of new products and features by our competitors;\n\u2022Development of new collaborative arrangements by us, our competitors or other parties;\n\u2022Changes in government regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022Changes in investor perception of our business and/or management;\n\u2022Changes in global economic conditions or general market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022COVID-19 developments, including the imposition of various governmental mandates in relation to COVID-19 or similar situations;\n\u2022Occurrence of major disruptive or catastrophic events; and\n\u2022Sales of our common stock held by certain equity investors or members of management.\nThe Company's stock price may reflect expectations of future growth and profitability and may also reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. Furthermore, and as is customary under credit facilities generally, certain actions, including our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares, are subject to the satisfaction of certain payment conditions prior to payment. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the Company might miss investor expectations or independent analyst estimates, which might result in analysts or investors changing their opinions and/or recommendations regarding our stock and our stock price may decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.", "PERMNO": 76081, "SIC": 3790, "TIC": "THO"}
