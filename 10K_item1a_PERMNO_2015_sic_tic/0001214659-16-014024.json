{"cik": "1463959", "company": "DS HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-10-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nAlthough this is not applicable to smaller reporting companies, we are providing such information herein because investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Therefore, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before deciding whether to invest in the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations or our financial condition. If any of the events discussed in the risk factors below occur, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the value and marketability of the common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe had a net loss of $10,753,991 and $1,934,728 for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and we have historically incurred losses and may incur losses in the future that may adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe had a net loss of $10,753,991 and $1,934,728 for 2015 and 2014 respectively. In the event we are unable to increase gross margins, reduced costs and/or generate sufficient additional revenues to offset our costs, we may continue to sustain losses in the future.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $20,978,751. Primarily as a result of our recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows and our accumulated deficit, our independent registered public accounting firm has included in its report for the year ended December 31, 2015, an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other factors, our ability to obtain sufficient financing to support our operations.\nOur ability to succeed depends on our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability.\nThe introduction of new products and services and expansion of our distribution channels have contributed significantly to our recent results, but we must continue to develop new and innovative ways to manufacture our products and expand our distribution in order to maintain our growth and achieve profitability. Our future growth and profitability will depend upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nOur ability to manage costs;\n\u00b7\nThe increasing level of competition in the skin care and personal care industry;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to continuously offer new or improved products;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to maintain efficient, timely and cost-effective production and delivery of our products;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to maintain sufficient production capacity for our products;\n\u00b7\nThe efficiency and effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts in building product and brand awareness;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to identify and respond successfully to emerging trends in the skin care, hair care and personal care industry;\n\u00b7\nThe level of consumer acceptance of our products;\n\u00b7\nRegulatory compliance costs; and\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic conditions and consumer confidence.\nWe may not be successful in executing our growth strategy, and even if we achieve targeted growth, we may not be able to reach profitability. Failure to successfully execute any material part of our growth strategy would significantly impair our future growth and our ability to attract and sustain investments in our business.\nThe majority of our revenue is generated on the basis of purchase orders, rather than long term purchase commitments; if we lose one or more of these customers it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWhile we have long-term agreements with several distributors, the majority of our customers may cancel a purchase order or defer shipments of our products at any time. Furthermore, most of our distributors can terminate their agreements with our Company on relatively short notice. While we have maintained long-term relationships with many of our distributors and have not experienced significant cancellation or deferment of customer orders, the lack of long-term purchase commitments creates a risk that product demand may be reduced if orders are canceled or deferred. Furthermore, because of our inability to rely on enforceable purchase contracts, and our limited visibility into future customer demand, actual revenue may be different from our forecasts, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we fail to promote and maintain our brand in the market, our businesses, operating results, financial condition, and our ability to attract customers will be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to create and maintain brand awareness for our product offerings. This may require a significant amount of capital to allow us to market our products and establish brand recognition and customer loyalty. Many of our competitors in this market are larger than us and have substantially greater financial resources. Additionally, many of the companies offering similar products have already established their brand identity within the marketplace. We can offer no assurances that we will be successful in establishing awareness of our brand allowing us to compete in this market. The importance of brand recognition will continue to increase because low barriers of entry to the industries in which we operate may result in an increased number of direct competitors. To promote our brands, we may be required to continue to increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand awareness. We may not generate a corresponding increase in revenue to justify these costs.\nOur products may require clinical trials to establish benefit claims and their efficacy.\nWhile the majority of the active ingredients in our current products have undergone independent third party studies and clinical trials to establish benefit claims and efficacy, certain ingredients contained in our products and our future products may require clinical trials to establish our benefit claims or their safety and efficacy. Such trials would require a significant amount of resources and there is no assurance that such trials will be favorable to the claims we make for our products, or that the cumulative authority established by such trials will be sufficient to support our claims. Moreover, both the findings and methodology of all clinical trials are subject to challenge by scientific bodies. If the findings of clinical trials are challenged or found to be insufficient to support our claims, additional trials may be required, or products may require re-formation, in order for us to continue to market current products or before future products can be marketed. Furthermore, there are limited studies, if any, on our product ingredients combined in our product formulations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our products even when used as directed will have the effects intended. In the event we are unable to substantiate benefit claims or efficacy, or in the event that historical clinical trials are refuted, market acceptance for our products may decrease or not develop, which would have a detrimental effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims by third parties.\nWe intend to protect our unpatented trade secrets and know-how through confidentiality or license agreements with third parties, employees and consultants, and by controlling access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, this method may not afford complete protection, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States and unauthorized parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products, processes or technology. Additionally, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar know-how and trade secrets. If third parties take actions that affect our rights or the value of our intellectual property, similar proprietary rights or reputation, or we are unable to protect our intellectual property from infringement or misappropriation, other companies may be able to offer competitive products at lower prices and we may not be able to effectively compete against these companies.\nWe also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, may require us to:\n\u00b7\nDefend against infringement claims which are expensive and time consuming;\n\u00b7\nCease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nRe-design, re-engineer or re-brand our products or packaging; or\n\u00b7\nEnter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nWe are dependent upon suppliers for our raw materials which we purchase on a per order basis without long term contracts and our suppliers are dependent on the continued availability and pricing of raw materials, either of which could negatively affect our ability to manage costs and maintain profitable operating margins.\nWe currently purchase our raw materials from suppliers with whom we have no written purchase contracts. Any supplier and any order may be terminated or rejected by any supplier at any time. Our reliance on open orders, no preference or assurances from suppliers, and our reliance on these suppliers, creates a risk that our supply of raw materials may be interrupted at any time. We may not be able to timely source another supplier, resulting in delays and decreased sales. We have tried to minimize these risks by maintaining inventories consistent with projected needs but can make no assurances that we will be able to maintain adequate stockpiles or that we will be able to acquire and stockpile raw materials at reasonable costs. Our failure to ensure a steady supply of raw material or any significant interruption in the supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to timely fulfill orders, resulting in lost orders and revenue.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers and compounders to provide raw materials for our products and to compound our products, and we have no control over these suppliers and compounders and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.\nSubstantially all of our products are compounded by unaffiliated compounders. We do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers or compounding sources, and we expect to compete with other companies for raw materials, production and import capacity.\nIf we experience significant increased demand, or need to replace an existing compounder, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of raw materials or additional compounding capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or compounder would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new compounding or raw material sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and compounding in our methods, products and quality control standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of raw materials or compounding of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that our suppliers and compounding will continue to provide raw materials and to compounding products that are consistent with our standards. We may receive shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. In that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. In addition, because we do not control our compounding, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe rely on limited intellectual property protection as an important element of competition.\nWe currently have trademark registration for most of our products. We rely on common law trademark rights to protect our unregistered trademarks as well as our trade dress rights. Common law trademark rights generally are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used, while a United States federal registration of a trademark enables the registrant to stop the unauthorized use of the trademark by any third party anywhere in the United States. We intend to register our trademarks in certain jurisdictions where our products are sold.\nWhile we have one patent pending and under review by the USPO, we currently have no patents on our products. We will continue to use the current business strategy of adding proprietary blends to each product formula. More than the name trademark, the proprietary blend formula makes formula replication challenging for any possible competitor. We believe adding proprietary blends make replication quite difficult and expensive. However, to the extent we do not have patents on our products; another company may replicate one or more of our products.\nLike other distributors and manufacturers of hair care, skin care and personal care products, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of the products that we sell results in injury.\nWhile we believe we are currently materially compliant with regulations covering our products, we may be subjected to various product liability claims, including claims that the products we sell contain contaminants, are improperly labeled or include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances. In addition, we may be forced to defend lawsuits. While to date we have never been subject to any product liability claim, we cannot predict whether product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or predict the effect of any resulting adverse publicity on our business. Moreover, we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us. If our insurance protection is inadequate and our third-party vendors do not indemnify us, the successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages. In addition, interactions of our products with other similar products, prescription medicines and over-the-counter drugs have not been fully explored.\nWe may also be exposed to claims relating to product advertising or product quality. People may purchase our products expecting certain physical results, unique to skin care and personal care products. If they do not perceive expected results to occur, such individuals may seek monetary retribution.\nIn the future, we could be subject to additional laws or regulations promulgated by the FDA or other federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities or subject to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations which may adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe are unable to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. The FDA or other governmental regulatory bodies could require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards or FDA approval prior to marketing and sale of certain products. Any or all of such requirements could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The cost to comply with new or changing regulations could be material. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurances that any product would ultimately comply with new or changing regulations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by unfavorable publicity within the skin care or personal care market.\nWe believe that the hair care, skin care and personal care markets are significantly affected by national media attention. As with any retail provider, future scientific research or publicity may not be favorable to the industry or to any particular product, and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. Because of our dependence on consumers\u2019 perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the use of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies and future reports of research that are perceived as less favorable or that question earlier research, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are highly dependent upon consumers\u2019 perceptions of the safety and quality of our products as well as similar products distributed by other companies. Thus, the mere publication of reports asserting that hair care, skin care or personal care products may be harmful or questioning their efficacy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether such reports are scientifically supported or whether the claimed harmful effects would be present at the dosages recommended for such products.\nOur success is dependent upon the successful introduction of our new products and success in expanding the demand for existing brands.\nWe believe the growth of our net sales is substantially dependent upon our ability to introduce our products to the public. At present, we have limited resources to spend on advertising and marketing therefore we will rely, to a large extent, on relationship with strategic partners to assist in our development of distribution channels. Our ability to meet future obligations is dependent in large measure on the success of our product sales. We expect to introduce additional products. The success of new products is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to formulate products that will appeal to consumers and respond to market trends in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that our efforts to formulate new products will be successful or that consumers will accept our new products. In addition, products experiencing strong popularity and rapid growth may not maintain their sales volumes over time.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with suppliers and compounders and we are dependent on the services of these third parties.\nWe purchase all of our products from third-party suppliers and compounders pursuant to purchase orders, but without any long-term agreements. In the event that a current supplier or compounder is unable to meet our compounding and delivery requirements at some time in the future, we may suffer short-term interruptions of delivery of certain products while we establish an alternative source. While we believe alternative sources are in most cases readily available and we have also established working relationships with several third-party suppliers and compounders, none of these agreements are long term. We also rely on third-party carriers for product shipments, including shipments to and from our warehouse facilities. We are therefore subject to the risks, including but not limited to employee strikes and inclement weather, associated with our carrier\u2019s ability to provide delivery services to meet our fulfillment and shipping needs. Failure to deliver products to our customers in a timely and accurate manner would harm our reputation and our business and results of operations.\nOur website and internal systems may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales.\nWe could be a target of cyber-attacks designed to penetrate our network security or the security of our internal systems, misappropriate proprietary information and/or cause interruptions to our services or delay the delivery of our products to customers. If an actual or perceived breach of our network security occurs, it may expose us to the loss of information, litigation and possible liability. Such a security breach could also divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. In addition, such a security breach could impair our ability to operate our business. If this happens, our reputation could be harmed, our revenues could decline and our business could suffer.\nWe are involved in several litigation matters that could harm our business, brand and reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are involved in a few lawsuits involving various suppliers and service providers. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. In addition, defending these claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and we may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings in the course of litigation. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of monetary damages, adverse effects on the market price of our common stock or changes to our business practices, and accordingly our business, brand and reputation, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do.\nOur competitors may succeed in formulating products that are more effective than those currently developed by us. Progress by other researchers in areas similar to those being explored by us may result in further competitive challenges. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products. They may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.\nIn addition, large pharmaceutical companies compete with others and with us in the skin care and personal care product industry. Increased competition from such companies could have a material adverse effect on us because such companies have greater financial and other resources available to them and possess manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities far greater than ours.\nWe also face competition in both the health food store and mass market distribution channels from private label products offered by health and natural food store chains, drugstore chains, mass merchandisers and supermarket chains.\nBusinesses may acquire in the future, as well as strategic investments such as joint venture arrangements, expose us to increased risks.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s growth strategy, we intend to explore acquisition opportunities, such as the recently filed Form 8-K on announcing plans for mergers, as originally filed with the SEC on February 22, 2016. We cannot provide any assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates in the future, that we will be able to acquire such candidates on economically acceptable terms or that we will be able to finance acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. If we acquire new businesses in the future, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses or we may complete potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, which may affect the market price of our common stock, inhibit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise restrict our operations. We may also enter into joint venture arrangements and equity investments intended to complement or expand our business, as well as divested of certain of our businesses or assets. These types of transactions can pose substantial risks and liabilities associated with their operations, as well as the risk that our relationships with our partners do not succeed in the manner that we anticipate. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to effectively integrate the operations, financial reporting, and personnel of acquired companies and manage acquired businesses or strategic investments, while maintaining uniform standards and controls;\n\u00b7\nour ability to realize our investment and anticipated synergies in the acquired businesses or strategic investments;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns, the potentially negative impact of changes in management on existing business relationships and other disruptions of our business;\n\u00b7\nthe risks associated with entering into businesses or markets in which we may have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u00b7\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to integrate the IT systems of acquired businesses into our existing IT infrastructure and manage those systems that cannot be effectively integrated;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement to write down acquired assets as a result of the acquired business or strategic investment being worth less than we paid or invested in it;\n\u00b7\ncapital expenditure requirements exceeding our estimates;\n\u00b7\nthe risk that an acquisition or strategic investment could increase future losses or reduce our future earnings; and\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of material liabilities, exposure to litigation, regulatory noncompliance or unknown liabilities, and no or limited indemnities from sellers or ongoing indemnity obligations to purchasers.\nIf we are unable to retain our senior management and key employees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent on the services of our senior management and key personnel. Although we have employment or severance agreements with certain of our key employees, these agreements do not prevent those individuals from ceasing their employment with us at any time. If we are unable to retain existing senior management and key personnel, or to attract other qualified senior management and key personnel on terms satisfactory to us, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We are in the process of remediating the material weaknesses, but we have not yet been able to complete our remediation efforts. It will take additional time to design, implement and test the controls and procedures required to enable our management to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot at this time estimate how long it will take to complete our remediation efforts or the cost of those efforts. We cannot assure you that measures we plan to take will be effective in mitigating or preventing significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in restatements of our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in the trading price of our stock. Refer to \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d below for further discussion.\nThe company is involved in a number of law suits, more particularly described in Item 3 hereof. The Company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings nor the financial impact to the Company in the event the Company is not successful in its defense of the claims. If the Company is unsuccessful the financial effect could be material.\nThroughout the year ended 2014 and 2015, Daniel Khesin, the Company's chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, received in addition to base compensation, reimbursement and payroll advances of expenses of approximately $76,000 and $40,000 respectively, which were for non-business related goods and services. Pursuant to his executive employment agreement $50,000 was to be payable in shares of the Company's common stock at fiscal year-end. While Mr. Khesin believed that these payments were received as satisfaction of certain bonus or other perquisites earned by him on a monthly basis under his employment agreement, such payments, if any, required approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received until 2016. Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits advances or loans to a director or executive officer of a public company. While our audit committee has concluded that the payments made to Mr. Khesin prior to board or compensation committee approval may be in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, in the event it is determined any such payments were a violation of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, such violation could have a material adverse effect on our Company, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, penalties, or investigations, in addition to potential securities litigation. As a consequence of these activities, the Company received notice from its independent auditor on September 29, 2016 of potential illegal acts concerning payments of personal expenses by the Company. The Company\u2019s audit committee has agreed with the findings. On September 29th, 2016, the company, in accordance with Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, informed the Commission in a letter also dated September 29th, 2016. See \"Controls and Procedures\" and \"Executive Compensation\" below.\nDuring 2013, in addition to base compensation paid to Abner Silva, a consultant deemed to be an officer by our independent auditor for accounting purposes, our company advanced approximately $11,500, to Mr. Silva. While Mr. Silva, believed that these payments were received as satisfaction of certain moneys owed to him or his affiliate companies, such payments, if any, required prior approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received. As a consequence of these activities, the company received notice from its independent auditor of potential illegal acts concerning payments of personal expenses by the Company. On September 29th, 2016. The company, in accordance with Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, informed the Commission in a letter also dated September 29th, 2016.\nIn 2015, the Company was served a suit in connection to its Asheville, NC (\u201cAsheville\u201d) abandoned office lease. The suit calls for payments of $73,000. In September 2016, the Company was notified it received a default judgement in the amount of $73,000. The Company plans of appealing the default judgment. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has sufficient amount accrued for the Asheville suit.\nOn April 20, 2016, DS Healthcare Group, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) was notified by Nasdaq that because the Company has not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company no longer qualifies for continued listing in accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5250(c)(1).\nOn April 12, 2016, the SEC issued a \u201cFormal Order\u201d directing a private non-public formal investigation to determine whether violations of the federal securities law may have been committed, directly or indirectly, by the Company, its officers, directors, employees, partners, subsidiaries and/or affiliates, and/or other persons or entities. The possible violations set forth in the Formal Order include Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), 13(b)(5), 13(k), 14(a), and 14(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, 13a-14, 13b2-1, 13b2-2(a), 14a3, 14a-9, and 14f-1. The relevant time period specified in the Formal Order is between January 1, 2010 and the present date. On April 15, 2016, the SEC issued a subpoena duces tecum to Mr. Khesin. On May 4, 2016, the SEC issued a subpoena duces tecum to the Company. The company is complying with all requests to the SEC and the review and production process is ongoing in nature. On or about July 27, 2016, the SEC issued a second subpoena duces tecum to the Company seeking a current copy of its QuickBooks file with a user name and password. The Company has complied with the second subpoena duces tecum. The company has no way of determining what the outcome of this investigation will be and cannot predict any financial impact.\nWe have not been in compliance with the Nasdaq Stock Market\u2019s requirements for continued listing and as a result our common stock may be delisted from trading on Nasdaq, which would have a material effect on us and our stockholders.\nWe have been delinquent in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC, as a result of which we are not in compliance with the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market and are subject to having our stock delisted from trading on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has not approved our common stock for continued listing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with this condition, in which case our common stock will be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. If our common stock is delisted, there can no assurance whether or when it would again be listed for trading on Nasdaq or any other exchange. If our common stock is delisted, the market price of our shares will likely decline and become more volatile, and our stockholders may find that their ability to trade in our stock will be adversely affected. Furthermore, institutions whose charters do not allow them to hold securities in unlisted companies might sell our shares, which could have a further adverse effect on the price of our stock.\nOn September 16, 2016, DS Healthcare Group (DSKX) received a letter from the NASDAQ Stock Market informing the Company of its decision to deny the Company\u2019s request for continued listing of the Company\u2019s common stock due to perceived violations of Listing Rule 5101 and Listing Rule 5250(a)(1). Amongst its concerns, Nasdaq raised doubts that the Company will file its delinquent report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 its dealing and the financial statements, on or before October 11, 2016, the expiration of the 180-day additional period for filing to regain compliance under IM-5810-2(F). The Company has requested an oral hearing before the NASDAQ Hearing Panel to appeal the decision and requested that the suspension of the Company\u2019s listing be stayed until receipt of a written decision by the Hearing Panel. The Company intends to satisfy NASDAQ\u2019s concerns, including but not limited to: providing minutes of certain meetings of the Board of Directors, providing the results of an independent investigation, addressing certain statements made to the NASDAQ in the course of their review of the Company\u2019s compliance with NASDAQ listing statements made that could be considered misrepresentation, and, on or before October 11, 2016, filing the delinquent periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The appeal hearing is set for November 10, 2016.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and may fluctuate significantly.\nThere has been a limited public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop. As a result, this could adversely affect our shareholders\u2019 ability to sell our common stock in short time periods, or possibly at all. Thinly traded common stock can be more volatile than common stock traded in an active public market. Our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, an investor\u2019s ability to achieve a return on its investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. The payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. If we do not pay dividends, a shareholder\u2019s ability to achieve a return on its investment in the Company will depend on any future appreciation in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which a shareholder initially purchased its common stock.\nIf shares of our common or preferred stock available for issuance or shares eligible for future sale were introduced into the market, it could dilute our current stockholders and/or hurt our stock price.\nWe are authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The exercise of outstanding options and/or warrants may cause substantial dilution to those who hold shares of common stock prior to such exercises. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of the common stock in the public market by these holders or perceptions that such sales may take place may lower the common stock's market price. We may sell our authorized, but unissued, common stock to satisfy our funding requirements. We are also authorized to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without stockholder approval. Any future series or class of preferred stock may have rights that are superior to the rights of the holders of our common stock. The sale or the proposed sale of substantial amounts of our common or preferred stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our stock price and our stockholders may also experience substantial dilution.\nIf the Company\u2019s closing bid price falls below the minimum price of $1.00 per share as per the requirements of NASDAQ listing rule 5550(a)(2), our Company\u2019s common stock may be delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d).\nIf the Company\u2019s common stock trades below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing bid price required for continued listing on NASDAQ, for 30 consecutive business days, the Company will receive a notification letter from NASDAQ and the Company will have 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days (or such longer period of time as the NASDAQ staff may require in some circumstances, but generally not more than 20 consecutive business days). If the Company\u2019s common stock does not achieve compliance by 180 calendar days, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180-day period to regain compliance if it meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and provides written notice to NASDAQ of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nIf we are delisted (upon such time of common stock will be quoted on the OTC Markets), our common stock would be deemed to be \u201cpenny stock\u201d as that term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Broker/dealers dealing in penny stocks are required to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks. Moreover, broker/dealers are required to determine whether an investment in a penny stock is a suitable investment for a prospective investor. These requirements may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. This could cause our stock price to decline.\nOn July 22nd, 2016, the company engaged independent counsel to perform an independent investigation into certain allegations made by former management. The results of this investigation are not yet complete and the company does not have any way to determine the outcome.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Daniel Khesin may only be terminated for cause with a court ruling. If we terminate Daniel Khesin without cause, we will be required to pay a severance amount equal to 42 months of his annual base salary.\nIf the Company terminates Mr. Khesin\u2019s employment without cause the Company shall pay as severance pay to Mr. Khesin within 30 days following the termination date, a lump sum amount equal to 42 months of his annual base salary and all of his options, if any, shall automatically vest and become fully exercisable. Furthermore, upon delivery of a Non-Renewal Notice, the Company shall also pay Mr. Khesin a lump sum amount equal to 42 months of his annual base salary. During the term of the agreement and for a 6-month period following the termination of the agreement, Mr. Khesin shall be subject to a non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions, unless his employment is terminated without cause by the Company or upon change of control of the Company or following a Non-Renewal Notice.", "PERMNO": 13702, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "DSKX"}
