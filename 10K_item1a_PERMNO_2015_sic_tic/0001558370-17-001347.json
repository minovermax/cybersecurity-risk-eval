RISK FACTORS\nWe have significant competition in the market for news and advertising, which may reduce our advertising and audience revenues in the future.\nOur primary source of revenues is advertising, followed by audience. The competition we face in the advertising industry generally results from an increasing number of digital media options available on the internet, which are expanding advertiser and consumer choices significantly, including social networking tools and mobile and other devices distributing news and other content. Faced with a multitude of media choices and a dramatic increase in accessible information, consumers may place greater value on when, where, how and at what price they consume digital content than they do on the source or reliability of such content. News aggregation websites and customized news feeds (often free to users) may reduce our traffic levels by minimizing the need for the audience to visit our websites or use our digital applications directly. Online traffic is also driven by internet search results; therefore, such results are critical to our ability to compete successfully. Search engines frequently update and change the methods for directing search queries to web pages or change methodologies and metrics for valuing the quality and performance of internet traffic on delivering cost-per-click advertisements. The failure to successfully manage search engine optimization efforts across our businesses could result in significant decreases in traffic to our various websites, which could result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If traffic levels stagnate or decline, we may not be able to create sufficient advertiser interest in our digital businesses or to maintain or increase the advertising rates of the inventory on our digital platforms. In addition, the proliferation of news sources and advertising platforms has resulted in significant competition and a negative impact on our traditional print business. This increased competition for our advertisers and consumers has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial results, including negatively impacting revenues and operating income.\nOur advertising revenues may decline due to weak general economic and business conditions.\nOur advertising revenues are dependent on general economic and business conditions in our markets or those impacting our customers. Certain aspects of the U.S. economy continue to be challenging in some of our markets. Many traditional retail companies also face greater competition from online retailers and have faced uncertainty in their businesses, affecting their advertising spending. These challenging economic and business conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our advertising revenues. To the extent these economic conditions continue or worsen, our business and advertising revenues could be further adversely affected, which could negatively impact our operations and cash flows and our ability to meet the covenants in our debt agreements. Our advertising revenues will be particularly adversely affected if advertisers respond to weak and uneven economic conditions or online competition by continuing to reduce their budgets or shift spending patterns or priorities, or if they are forced to consolidate or cease operations. Consolidation\nacross various industries may also reduce our overall advertising revenues. Further, we are subject to fluctuating economic conditions in the local markets we serve. For example, real estate advertising fluctuates with the health of the real estate market. In addition, seasonal variations in consumer spending cause our quarterly advertising revenues to fluctuate. Advertising revenues in the second and fourth quarters, which contain more holidays, are typically higher than in the first and third quarters, in which economic activity is generally slower. If general economic conditions and other factors cause a decline in revenues, particularly during the fourth quarter, we may not be able to increase or maintain our revenues for the year, which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nTo remain competitive, we must be able to respond to and exploit changes in technology, services and standards and changes in consumer behavior. Significant capital investments may be required.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for delivery of news and other content and have resulted in a wide variety of consumer demands and expectations, which are also rapidly evolving. For example, the number of people who access online services through devices other than personal computers, including smartphones, handheld tablets and mobile devices has increased dramatically in the past several years and is projected to continue to increase. If we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nTechnological developments also pose other challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. New delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, the loss of distribution control and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers. We may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on websites proliferates.\nTechnological developments and any changes we make to our business model may require significant capital investments. We may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or opportunities and we may incur costs of research and development in building and maintaining the necessary and continually evolving technology infrastructure. Some of our existing competitors and new entrants may have greater operational, financial and other resources or may otherwise be better positioned to compete for opportunities and as a result, our digital businesses may be less successful, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf we are not successful in growing and managing our digital businesses, our business, financial condition will be adversely affected.\nOur future growth depends to a significant degree upon the development and management of our digital businesses. The growth of our digital businesses over the long term depends on various factors, including, among other things, the ability to:\n\u00b7\ncontinue to increase digital audiences;\n\u00b7\nattract advertisers to our digital products;\n\u00b7\ntailor our product for mobile devices;\n\u00b7\nmaintain or increase the advertising rates on our digital products;\n\u00b7\nimprove our ability to increase the relevance of advertisements shown to users;\n\u00b7\nmanage the impact of new technologies that could block or obscure the display of advertisements;\n\u00b7\nexploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of competitors and develop new content, products and services; and\n\u00b7\ninvest funds and resources in digital opportunities.\nIn addition, we expect that our digital business will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues in future\nperiods. For 2016, digital advertising revenues comprised 30.6% of total advertising revenues compared to 26.2% in 2015. Digital-only advertising revenues increased 14.8% in 2016 compared to 2.9% in 2015. Total digital-only, which includes digital-only revenues from advertising and audience, was up 14.3% in 2016 compared to 4.7% in 2015. As our digital business becomes a greater portion of our overall business, we will face a number of increased risks from managing our digital operations, including, but not limited, to the following:\n\u00b7\nstructuring our sales force to effectively sell advertising in the digital advertising arena versus our historical print advertising business;\n\u00b7\nattracting and retaining employees with the skill sets and knowledge base needed to successfully operate in digital business; and\n\u00b7\nmanaging the transition to a digital business from a historical print-focused business and the need to concurrently reduce the physical infrastructure, distribution infrastructure and related fixed costs associated with the historical print business.\nIf we are unable to execute cost-control measures successfully, our total operating costs may be greater than expected, which may adversely affect our profitability.\nAs a result of adverse general economic and business conditions and our operating results, we have taken steps to lower operating costs by reducing workforce, consolidating or regionalizing operations and implementing general cost-control measures. If we do not achieve expected savings from these initiatives, or if our operating costs increase as a result of these initiatives, our total operating costs may be greater than anticipated. These cost-control measures may also affect our business and our ability to generate future revenue. Because portions of our expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues, we may be limited in our ability to reduce costs in the short term to offset any declines in revenues. If these cost-control efforts do not reduce costs sufficiently or otherwise adversely affect our business, income from continuing operations may decline.\nDifficult business conditions in the economy generally and in our industry or changes to our business and operations may result in goodwill and masthead impairment charges.\nDue to business conditions, including lower revenues and operating cash flow, we recorded masthead impairment charges of $9.2 million in 2016. We also recorded goodwill impairment charges of $290.9 million in 2015, masthead impairment charges of $13.9 million, $5.2 million $5.3 million and $2.8 million in 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2011, respectively. As of December 25, 2016, we have goodwill of $705.2 million and mastheads of $171.4 million. Further erosion of general economic, market or business conditions (nationally and in our local markets) could have a negative impact on our business and stock price, which may require that we record additional impairment charges in the future, which negatively affects our results of operations.\nOur business, reputation and results of operations could be negatively impacted by data security breaches and other security threats and disruptions.\nCertain network and information systems are critical to our business activities. Network and information systems may be affected by cybersecurity incidents that can result from deliberate attacks or system failures. Threats include, but are not limited to, computer hackings, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, or other malicious activities. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. As a result of these breaches, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users\u2019 data or our systems may be compromised. These events evolve quickly and often are not recognized until after an attack is launched, so we may be unable to anticipate these attacks or to implement adequate preventative measures. Our network and information systems may also be compromised by power outages, fire, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, war or other similar events. There can be no assurance that the actions, measures and controls we have implemented will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to mission-critical systems, the unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data. Although we have experienced cybersecurity incidents, to date none has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless, these types of events are likely to occur in the future and such events could disrupt our operations or other third party information technology systems in which we are involved. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems, or infrastructure by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could result in legal or\nfinancial liability or otherwise negatively impact our operations. They also could require significant management attention and resources, and could negatively impact our reputation among our customers, advertisers and the public, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe are subject to significant financial risk as a result of our $874 million in total consolidated debt.\nAs of December 25, 2016, we had approximately $873.7 million in total principal indebtedness outstanding. This level of debt increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and we may need to refinance our debt prior to its scheduled maturity. Higher leverage ratios, our credit ratings, our economic performance, adverse financial markets or other factors could adversely affect our future ability to refinance maturing debt on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, or the ultimate structure of such refinancing.\nCovenants in the indenture governing the notes and our other existing debt agreements will restrict our business.\nThe indenture governing our 9.00% Senior Secured Notes due in 2022 (the \u201c9.00% Notes\u201d) and our secured credit agreement contain various covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions, our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincur or assume liens;\n\u00b7\nincur additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u00b7\nissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, repurchase, redeem or make payments on capital stock or prepay, repurchase, redeem, retire, defease, acquire or cancel certain of our existing notes or debentures prior to the stated maturity thereof;\n\u00b7\nmake loans, investments or acquisitions;\n\u00b7\ncreate or permit restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us or to guarantee our debt, limit our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to create liens, or make or pay intercompany loans or advances;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\nsell, transfer, license, lease or dispose of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets, including the capital stock of our subsidiaries; and\n\u00b7\ndissolve, liquidate, consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all the assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to, another person.\nThe restrictions contained in the indenture governing the 9.00% Notes and the secured credit agreement could adversely affect our ability to:\n\u00b7\nfinance our operations;\n\u00b7\nmake needed capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\ndispose of assets\n\u00b7\nmake strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;\n\u00b7\nwithstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u00b7\nrefinance our outstanding indebtedness prior to maturity;\n\u00b7\nengage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and\n\u00b7\nplan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nOur ability to comply with covenants contained in the indenture for the 9.00% Notes and our secured credit agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Even if we are able to comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to manage our business in our sole discretion could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that we believe would be beneficial to us. In addition, our obligations under the 9.00% Notes and the secured credit agreement are secured, subject to permitted liens, on a first-priority basis, and in the event of default such security interests could be enforced by the collateral agent for the secured credit agreement. In the event of such enforcement, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from the enforcement would be sufficient to pay our obligations under the 9.00% Notes or secured credit agreement or at all.\nWe have significant financial obligations and in the future we will need cash to repay our existing indebtedness and meet our other obligations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash to pay our obligations would adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash internally to repay all of our indebtedness at maturity or to meet our other obligations. As of December 25, 2016, we had approximately $873.7 million of total indebtedness outstanding and approximately $30.7 million in face amount of letters of credit outstanding under a Collateralized Issuance and Reimbursement Agreement. Of the $873.7 million aggregate principal amount outstanding as of December 25, 2016, we have approximately $16.9 million of notes with an interest rate of 5.750% due in 2017; $491.4 million of 9.00% Notes due in 2022; approximately $89.2 million of debentures with an interest rate of 7.150% due in 2027 and approximately $276.2 million of debentures with an interest rate of 6.875% due in 2029.\nAs of December 25, 2016, the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plan (\u201cPension Plan\u201d) exceeded Pension Plan assets by $487.4 million. Future contributions are subject to numerous assumptions, including, among others, changes in interest rates, returns on assets in the Pension Plan and future government regulations. In addition, we have a limited number of supplemental retirement plans, which provide certain key employees with additional retirement benefits. These plans have no assets; however as of December 25, 2016, our projected benefit obligation of these plans was $119.1 million. These plans are on a pay-as-you-go basis.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the 9.00% Notes and our other series of outstanding notes, to make required contributions to the Pension Plan, to fund the supplemental retirement plans and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the 9.00% Notes and our other series of outstanding notes or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before the maturity thereof, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations or our ability to refinance our existing debt. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the indenture governing the 9.00% Notes and the secured credit agreement, may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt.\nWe may be required to make greater contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in the next several years than previously required, placing greater liquidity needs upon our operations.\nThe projected benefit obligations of the Pension Plan exceeded Pension Plan assets by $487.4 million as of December 25, 2016, an increase of $22.6 million from December 27, 2015, primarily due to unfavorable change in the discount rate. The value of the Pension Plan assets fluctuates based on many factors, including changes in interest rates and market returns.\nThe excess of benefit obligations over pension assets is expected to give rise to required pension contributions over the next several years. Over the last several years federal legislation has provided for pension funding relief in the form of mandated changes in the discount rates used to calculate the projected benefit obligations for purposes of funding pension plans. Recent new legislation and calculations use historical averages of long-term highly-rated corporate bonds (within ranges as defined in the legislation) which have an impact of applying a higher discount rate to determine the projected benefit obligations for funding and current long-term interest rates, but also mandated increases in fees paid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, also known as the PBGC, based in part on the level of underfunding in the company\u2019s qualified defined pension plan. Even with the relief provided by these legislative rules, we expect future contributions to be required. In addition, adverse conditions in the capital markets and/or lower long-term interest rates may result in greater annual contribution requirements, placing greater liquidity needs upon our operations.\nWe require newsprint for operations and, therefore, our operating results may be adversely affected if the price of newsprint increases or if we experience disruptions in our newsprint supply chain.\nNewsprint is the major component of our cost of raw materials. Newsprint accounted for 4.9% of our operating expenses, excluding impairments, in 2016 compared to 5.7% in 2015. Accordingly, our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile and may increase as a result of various factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndeclining newsprint supply from mill closures;\n\u00b7\nreduction in newsprint suppliers because of consolidation in the newsprint industry;\n\u00b7\npaper mills reducing their newsprint supply because of switching their production to other paper grades; and\n\u00b7\na decline in the financial situation of newsprint suppliers.\nWe have not attempted to hedge price fluctuations in the normal purchases of newsprint or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint other than the natural hedge created by our ownership interest in Ponderay. If the price of newsprint increases materially, our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for deliveries of newsprint. If newsprint suppliers experience labor unrest, transportation difficulties or other supply disruptions, our ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired and/or the cost of the newsprint could increase, both of which would negatively affect our operating results.\nA portion of our employees are members of unions, and if we experience labor unrest, our ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired.\nIf we experience labor unrest, our ability to produce and deliver newspapers could be impaired in some locations. In addition, the results of future labor negotiations could harm our operating results. Our media companies have not experienced a labor strike for decades. However, we cannot ensure that a strike will not occur at one or more of our media companies in the future. As of December 25, 2016, approximately 5.3% of full-time and part-time employees were represented by unions. Most of our union-represented employees are currently working under labor agreements, with expiration dates through 2018. We face collective bargaining upon the expirations of these labor agreements. Even if our media companies do not suffer a labor strike, our operating results could be harmed if the results of labor negotiations restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our newspaper operations. In addition, our ability to make short-term adjustments to control compensation and benefits costs, rebalance our portfolio of businesses or otherwise adapt to changing business needs may be limited by the terms and duration of our collective bargaining agreements.\nWe have invested in certain digital or other ventures, but such ventures may not be as successful as expected, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe continue to evaluate our business and make strategic investments in digital ventures, either alone or with partners, to further our digital growth. We have, among others, investments with other partners in CareerBuilder LLC, which operates a premier online job website, CareerBuilder.com, as well as certain other digital company investments. We have numerous small \u201cseed\u201d investments in other digital companies. We also own 25.0% of Nucleus, a national marketing agency, and, through three wholly-owned subsidiaries, a combined 27.0% interest in the Ponderay Newsprint Company. The success of these ventures is dependent to an extent on the efforts and strategic plans of our partners. As previously announced, TEGNA, Inc. and the partners who own CareerBuilder, LLC, have decided to evaluate strategic alternatives for CareerBuilder, LLC, a process and outcome which we do not control. Further, our ability to monetize the investments and/or the value we may receive upon any disposition may depend on the actions of our partners. As a result, our ability to control the timing or process relating to a disposition may be limited, which could adversely affect the liquidity of these investments or the value we may ultimately attain upon disposition. If the value of the companies in which we invest declines, we may be required to record a charge to earnings. There can be no assurances that we will receive a return on these investments or that they will result in advertising growth or will produce equity income or capital gains in future years.\nCirculation volume declines will adversely affect our print audience and print advertising revenues, and audience price increases could exacerbate declines in circulation volumes.\nPrint advertising and audience revenues are affected by circulation volumes and readership levels of our print newspapers. In recent years, newspaper companies, including us, have experienced difficulty maintaining or increasing print circulation levels because of a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nincreased competition from other publications and other forms of media technologies available in various markets, including the internet and other new media formats that are often free for users;\n\u00b7\ncontinued fragmentation of media audiences;\n\u00b7\na growing preference among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news online or other than from a traditional printed newspaper;\n\u00b7\nincreases in subscription and newsstand rates; and\n\u00b7\ndeclining discretionary spending by consumers affected by negative economic conditions.\nThese factors could also affect our media companies\u2019 ability to institute circulation price increases for print products. Also, print price increases have historically had an initial negative impact on circulation volumes that may not be mitigated with additional marketing and promotion. A prolonged reduction in circulation volumes would have a material adverse effect on print advertising revenues. To maintain our circulation base, we may be required to incur additional costs that we may not be able to recover through audience and advertising revenues.\nWe rely on third party vendors for various services and if any of those third parties fail to fulfill their obligations to us with quality and timeliness we expect, or if our relationship with such vendors is damaged, our business may be harmed.\nWe rely on third party vendors to provide various services such as printing, distribution and production, as well as various information technology systems and services. We do not control the operation of these vendors. If any of these third party vendors terminate their relationship with us, or do not provide an adequate level of service, it would be disruptive to our business as we seek to replace the vendor or remedy the inadequate level of service. This disruption may adversely affect our operating results.\nDevelopments in the laws and regulations to which we are subject may result in increased costs and lower advertising revenues from our digital businesses.\nWe are generally subject to government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our websites are available worldwide and are subject to laws regulating the internet both within and outside the United States. The adoption of any laws or regulations that limit use of the internet, including laws or practices limiting internet neutrality, could decrease demand for, or the usage of, our products and services, which could adversely affect our operating results. We may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. Advertising revenues from our digital businesses could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to the use of consumer data in digital media.\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are parties to litigation and regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. For example, we are currently involved in two class action lawsuits that are described further in Part II, Item 8, Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our business as it is presently being conducted.", "PERMNO": 75261, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "MNIQQ"}
