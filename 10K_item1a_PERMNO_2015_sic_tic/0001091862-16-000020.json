{"cik": "1091862", "company": "Chemtura CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nThe most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows include, but are not limited to, the factors described below. Except as otherwise indicated, these factors may or may not occur and we cannot predict the likelihood of any such factor occurring.\nWe operate on an international scale and are exposed to risks in the countries in which we have significant operations or interests.\nWe are dependent, in large part, on the economies of the countries in which we manufacture and market our products. Of our 2015 net sales, 46% were to customers in the United States and Canada, 29% to Europe and Africa, 21% to the Asia/Pacific region and 4% to Latin America. As such, we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations. Those risks include:\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with anti-corruption laws, including Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u2022\ncompliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple regimes;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, interpretation of tax laws and tax audit outcomes;\n\u2022\nfluctuations or devaluations in currency values, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or repatriate cash from outside the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;\n\u2022\ndiscriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies;\n\u2022\nincreased sovereign risk, such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit worthiness of local governments;\n\u2022\nvarying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights;\n\u2022\ngreater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;\n\u2022\ndesign and implementation of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base; and\n\u2022\nimposition of more or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our sales or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales.\nIn addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. A slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending, and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability. Continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the European Union and in emerging markets could adversely affect us. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in the price of the raw materials or energy utilized for our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe purchase significant amounts of raw materials and energy for our businesses. The cost of these raw materials and energy, in the aggregate, represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. The prices and availability of the raw materials we utilize vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile. From time to time in the past, we have experienced significant cost increases in purchase of raw materials and energy which has had a negative impact on our operating results.\nAlthough we have attempted, and will continue to attempt, to match increases in the prices of raw materials or energy with corresponding increases in sales prices for the products produced with these materials, we may not be able to immediately raise product prices, if at all. Ultimately, our ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials or energy to customers is highly dependent upon market conditions. Specifically, there is a risk that raising prices charged to our customers could result in a loss of sales volume. In the past, we have not always been able to pass on increases in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers, in whole or in part, and there will likely be periods in the future when we will not be able to pass on these price increases. Reactions by our customers and competitors to our price increases could cause us to reevaluate and possibly reverse such price increases, which would negatively affect operating results.\nAny disruption in the availability of the raw materials or energy utilized for our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAcross our businesses, there are a limited number of suppliers for some of our raw materials and utilities and, in some cases, the number of sources for and availability of raw materials and utilities is specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located. It is also common in the chemical industries for a facility to have a sole, dedicated source for its utilities, such as steam, electricity and gas. Having a sole or limited number of suppliers may result in our having limited negotiating power, particularly during times of rising raw material costs. Having a sole source supplier also increases the vulnerability and severity of disruptions in the supply of raw materials. Even where we have multiple suppliers for a raw material or utility, these suppliers may not make up for the loss of a major supplier. Moreover, any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements. For some of our products, the facilities or distribution channels of raw material and utility suppliers and our production facilities form an integrated system, which limits our ability to negotiate favorable terms in supply agreements.\nIn addition, as part of an increased trend towards vertical integration in the chemicals industry, other chemical companies are purchasing raw material suppliers. This is further reducing the available suppliers for certain raw materials.\nIf one or more of our significant raw material or utility suppliers were unable to meet its obligations under present supply arrangements, raw materials may become unavailable within the geographic area from which they are now sourced, or supplies may otherwise be constrained or disrupted, our businesses could be forced to incur increased costs for our raw materials or utilities, which would have a direct negative impact on plant operations and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nProduction facilities are subject to operating risks that may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities. Such production facilities are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of chemical products, which include chemical spills, pipeline or storage tank leaks and ruptures, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and exposure to hazardous substances related to the manufacturing, storage and transportation of dangerous chemicals.\nDisruptions at any of our facilities could be caused by maintenance outages; prolonged power failures or reductions; explosions or fires; a breakdown, failure or substandard performance of any of our equipment; the effect of noncompliance with material environmental requirements or permits; disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including railroad tracks, ports, bridges, tunnels or roads; fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophic disasters; an act of terrorism; cyber-attack on operating systems; or other operational problems.\nAny prolonged disruption in operations at any of our facilities could cause significant lost production. Losses related to any such disruption in operations may be either uninsured or underinsured. Moreover, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers during the time that it takes for us to reopen or replace a damaged facility. If any of these events were to occur, it could cause our customers to seek other suppliers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nMany potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities. Furthermore, we are subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure, including workers compensation, exposure of persons located nearby our premises as well as other matters. In addition, we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business.\nWe maintain property, business interruption, products liability and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, as well as insurance policies covering other types of risks, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. Each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits, in accordance with industry standards and practices. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts or terms of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nMaintenance, expansion and refurbishment of our facilities or the construction of new facilities involve significant risks.\nOur facilities may require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected operational or mechanical failure, including failure associated with breakdowns and forced outages, could reduce our facilities' production capacity below expected levels which would reduce our revenues. Unanticipated capital expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading or repairing our facilities may also reduce profitability.\nIf we make any major modifications to our facilities, we may be required to install the best available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable discharge or emissions rates as such terms are defined under applicable law. Any such modifications likely would result in substantial additional capital expenditures and may prolong the time necessary to bring the facility on line. We may also choose to refurbish or upgrade our facilities based on our assessment that such activity will provide adequate financial returns. However, such activities require time for development and capital expenditures before commencement of commercial operations, and key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding construction costs and timing which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, the construction of new manufacturing facilities entails a number of risks, including the ability to begin production within the cost and timeframe estimated and to attract a sufficient number of skilled workers to meet the needs of the new facility. Additionally, our assessment of the projected benefits associated with the construction of new manufacturing facilities is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions, which in turn are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties that are beyond our control. If we experience delays or increased costs, our estimates and assumptions are incorrect, or other unforeseen events occur, our business, ability to supply customers, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nFailure to develop and market new products and manage product life cycles could impact our competitive position and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results are largely dependent on our assessment and management of our portfolio of current, new and developing products and our ability to bring those products to market. We plan to grow earnings by focusing on developing markets and solutions to meet increasing demand for products. Our ability to execute this strategy and our other growth plans successfully could be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development such as the inability to identify viable new products, successfully complete research and development, obtain relevant regulatory approvals, effectively manage our manufacturing process or costs, obtain intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products and services. Because of the lengthy and costly development process, technological challenges and intense competition, we cannot assure you that any of the products we are currently developing, or could begin to develop in the future, will achieve commercial success. Further, sales of our new products could replace sales of some of our current products, offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction. We must also successfully anticipate and adapt our products to the changing requirements of our customers. If we do not keep our products current with our customers\u2019 needs, they may seek alternative suppliers. A failure to develop commercially successful products, to develop additional uses for existing products or to keep existing products at the cutting edge of product performance, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cyclical nature of the chemicals industry causes significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur historical operating results reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply and demand balance of the chemicals industry. The chemicals industry has experienced alternating periods of inadequate capacity and supply, allowing prices and profit margins to increase, followed by periods when substantial capacity is added, resulting in oversupply, overcapacity, corresponding declining utilization rates and, ultimately, declining prices and profit margins. Some of the markets in which our customers participate, such as the automotive, aviation, electronics, energy and building and construction industries, are cyclical in nature, thus posing a risk to us. These markets are highly competitive, are driven to a large extent by end-use markets and may experience overcapacity, all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products and result in volatile operating results and cash flows over our business cycle. Future growth in product demand may not be sufficient to utilize current or future capacity. Excess industry capacity may continue to depress our volumes and margins on some products. Our operating results, accordingly, may be volatile as a result of these changes in industry capacity.\nFailure to accurately forecast market and customer trends for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results or operating efficiencies.\nOur ability to meet the product demands of our customers require that we accurately forecast market and customer trends for our products. If we are unable to accurately forecast market and customer trends for our products, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe may experience excess capacity with respect to the products we have agreed to supply to the purchaser of our Chemtura AgroSolutions business under the post-closing supply agreements. If such supply agreements are terminated at the end of their minimum contract terms and we are unable to find additional production to fill the vacated capacity, we may experience declining utilization rates which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nDecline in general economic conditions and other external factors may adversely impact our operations.\nExternal factors, including domestic and global economic conditions, international events and circumstances, competitor actions and government regulation, are beyond our control and can cause fluctuations in demand and volatility in the prices of raw materials and other costs that can intensify the impact of economic cycles on our operations. We produce a broad range of products that are used as additives and components in other products in a wide variety of end-use markets. As a result, our products may be negatively impacted by supply and demand instability in other industries and the effects of that instability on supply chain participants. Economic and political conditions in countries in which we operate may also adversely impact our operations. For example, some countries in Europe have been particularly adversely affected by rising government deficits and debt levels, which require certain countries to adopt deflationary fiscal and monetary policies that could negatively affect our businesses. Although our diversified product portfolio and international presence lessens our dependence on a single market and exposure to economic conditions or political instability in any one country or region, our businesses are nonetheless sensitive to changes in economic conditions. For example, in 2015, 21% of our net sales were from the Asia/Pacific region. To further our growth strategies in the Asia/Pacific region, we completed the construction of a manufacturing facility in Nantong, People's Republic of China. An economic downturn in China could negatively impact our growth strategies in the Asia/Pacific region. Financial crises and economic downturns anywhere in the world could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCompetition may adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe face significant competition in many of the markets in which we operate due to the trend toward global expansion and consolidation by competitors. Some of our existing competitors are larger than we are and may have more resources and better access to capital markets to facilitate continued expansion or new product development. Additionally, some of our competitors have a greater product range and distributional capability than we do for certain products and in specific regions. We also expect that we will continue to face new competitive challenges as well as additional risks inherent in international operations in developing regions. We are susceptible to price competition in certain markets in which customers are sensitive to changes in price. At the same time, we also face downward pressure on prices from industry overcapacity, lower cost structures in certain businesses and lower energy and raw material prices. The further use and introduction of generic and alternative products by our competitors may result in increased competition and could require us to reduce our prices and take other steps to compete effectively. These measures could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Alternatively, if we were to increase prices in response to this competition, the reactions of our competitors and customers to such price increases could cause us to reevaluate and possibly reverse such price increases or risk a loss in sales volumes.\nThe loss of or a significant reduction in purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our operations.\nWhile some of our largest customers have entered into supply contracts with us, these customers may not continue to purchase the same levels of our products in the future due to a variety of reasons. Some of our major customers could decide to purchase the products we provide to them from other third-party providers. If any of our major customers substantially reduces or altogether ceases purchasing our products, depending on market conditions, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are subject to extensive government scrutiny and regulation.\nWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign government authorities. In some cases, we need government approval of our products, manufacturing processes and facilities before we may sell certain products. Many products are required to be registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and with comparable government agencies in the\nEuropean Union and elsewhere. We are also subject to ongoing reviews of our products, manufacturing processes and facilities by government authorities, and must also produce product data and comply with detailed regulatory requirements.\nThe REACh legislation requires chemical manufacturers and importers in the European Union to demonstrate the safety of the chemical substances contained in their products via a substance registration process. The registration process requires capital and resource commitments to compile and file comprehensive chemical dossiers regarding the use and attributes of each chemical substance manufactured or imported by Chemtura and requires us to perform chemical safety assessments. Successful registration under REACh is a functional prerequisite to the continued sale of our products in the European Union market. Thus, REACh and other similar regulations present a risk to the continued sale of our products in the European Union should we be unable or unwilling to complete the registration process or if the European Union seeks to ban or materially restrict the production or importation of the chemical substances used in our products.\nNew or stricter laws and regulations may be introduced that could result in additional compliance costs and prevent or inhibit the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of our products. Such outcomes could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nEnvironmental, health and safety regulation matters could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land, surface, subsurface strata and water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Our operations bear the risk of violations of those laws and sanctions for violations such as clean-up and removal costs, long-term monitoring and maintenance costs, costs of waste disposal, natural resource damages and payments for property damage and personal injury. Although it is our policy to comply with such laws and regulations, it is possible that we have not been or may not be at all times in compliance with all of these requirements.\nAdditionally, these requirements, and enforcement of these requirements, may become more stringent in the future. The ultimate additional cost of compliance with any such requirements could be material. Non-compliance could subject us to material liabilities such as government fines or orders, criminal sanctions, third-party lawsuits, remediations and settlements, the suspension, modification or revocation of necessary permits and licenses, or the suspension of non-compliant operations. We may also be required to make significant site or operational modifications at substantial cost or pay remediation costs at current or former facilities. In addition, various federal and state statutes impose strict liability upon various classes of persons with respect to costs associated with the investigation and remediation of waste disposal sites. Future regulatory or other developments could also restrict or eliminate the use of, or require us to make modifications to, our products, packaging, manufacturing processes and technology, which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAt any given time, we may be involved in claims, litigation, administrative proceedings, settlements and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities, including clean-up costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites, natural resource damages, property damage, personal injury and regulatory compliance or non-compliance. The resolution of these environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrent and future litigation, governmental investigations, prosecutions and administrative claims, including antitrust-related governmental investigations and lawsuits, could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have been involved in several significant lawsuits and claims relating to environmental and chemical exposure matters, and may in the future be involved in similar litigation. Additionally, we are routinely subject to other civil claims, litigation and arbitration and regulatory investigations arising in the ordinary course of our business as well as with respect to our divested businesses. We could become subject to additional claims. An adverse outcome of these claims could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have also been involved in a number of governmental investigations, prosecutions and administrative claims in the past, including antitrust-related governmental investigations and civil lawsuits, and may in the future be subject to similar claims. Additionally, we have incurred and could again incur expenses in connection with antitrust-related matters, including expenses related to our cooperation with governmental authorities and defense-related civil lawsuits.\nConflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks and general instability along with increased security regulations related to our industry, could adversely affect our business.\nConflicts, military actions and terrorist attacks have precipitated economic instability and turmoil in financial markets. The uncertainty and economic disruption resulting from hostilities, military action or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of our facilities and operations or those of our suppliers or customers. Accordingly, any conflict, military action or terrorist attack that impacts us or any of our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFederal regulations aimed at increasing security at certain chemical production plants and similar legislation that may be proposed in the future could require us to enhance plant security and to alter or discontinue our production of certain chemical products, thereby increasing our operating costs and causing an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRegulations have been implemented by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) aimed at decreasing the risk, and effects, of potential terrorist attacks on chemical plants located within the United States. Pursuant to these regulations, these goals would be accomplished in part through the requirement that certain high-priority facilities develop a prevention, preparedness, and response plan after conducting a vulnerability assessment. In addition, companies may be required to evaluate the possibility of using less dangerous chemicals and technologies as part of their vulnerability assessments and prevention plans and implementing feasible safer technologies in order to minimize potential damage to their facilities from a terrorist attack. We have registered certain of our sites with DHS in accordance with these regulations, have conducted vulnerability assessments at applicable sites and have received DHS review and approval of our security plans. These regulations may be revised further and additional legislation may be proposed in the future on this topic. It is possible that such future legislation could contain terms that are more restrictive than what has recently been passed and which would be more costly to us. We cannot predict the final form of currently pending legislation or other related legislation that may be passed and we can provide no assurance that such legislation will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations in a future reporting period. In addition, we may incur liabilities for subsequent damages in the event that we fail to comply with these regulations.\nOur businesses depend upon many proprietary technologies, including patents, licenses and trademarks. Our competitive position could be adversely affected if we fail to protect our patents or other intellectual property rights or if we become subject to claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others. Our patents may not provide full protection against competing manufacturers outside of the United States, the European Union countries and certain other developed countries. Weaker protection may adversely impact our sales and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property is of particular importance for a number of the specialty chemicals that we manufacture and sell. The trademarks and patents that we own may be challenged, and because of such challenges, we could eventually lose our exclusive rights to use and enforce such patented technologies and trademarks, which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations. We are licensed to use certain patents and technology owned by other companies, including foreign companies, to manufacture products complementary to our own products. We pay royalties for these licenses in amounts not considered material, in the aggregate, to our consolidated results.\nIn some of the countries in which we operate, such as China, the laws protecting patent holders are significantly weaker than in the United States, countries in the European Union and certain other developed countries. Weaker protection may assist competing manufacturers in becoming more competitive in markets in which they might not have otherwise been able to introduce competing products for a number of years. As a result, we tend to rely more heavily upon trade secret and know-how protection in these regions, as applicable, rather than patents.\nWe also rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets in all regions to develop and maintain our competitive position. Although it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to restrict the use and disclosure of trade secrets and proprietary know-how, those confidentiality agreements may be breached. Additionally, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how, and others could obtain knowledge of such trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. The failure of our patents, trademarks or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or proprietary know-how and the brands under which we market and sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot be assured that our products or methods do not infringe on the patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of others. Infringement and other intellectual claims or proceedings brought against us, whether successful or not, could\nresult in substantial costs and harm our reputation. Such claims and proceedings can also distract and divert management and key personnel from other tasks important to the success of our business. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease selling products that contain asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages for past use of the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the holder of the asserted intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms; and\n\u2022\nredesign or rename, in the case of trademark claims, our products to avoid infringing the rights of third parties.\nSuch requirements could adversely affect our revenue, increase costs, and harm our financial condition.\nCybersecurity attack, acts of cyber-terrorism, failure of technology systems and other disruptions to our information technology systems could compromise our information, disrupt our operations, and expose us to liability, which may adversely impact our operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees in our information technology systems, including in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this data is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached or disrupted due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such attack, breach or disruption could compromise our information technology systems and the information stored in them could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen and our business operations could be disrupted. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information or business disruption could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our operations.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for specialty chemicals.\nDue to concerns about the risks of global warming and climate change, a number of various international, national and regional legislative and regulatory initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. Legislative and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur substantially increased capital, operating, maintenance, and compliance costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, costs to acquire emissions allowances, and costs to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. In addition, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. Consequently, legislative and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with more extreme weather conditions, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our development and production activities, increase our costs of operations or reduce the efficiency of our operations, and potentially increase costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such conditions. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process- related services provided by companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute strategic acquisitions, partnerships or other strategic opportunities which could hinder our strategy or result in unanticipated expenses and losses.\nPart of our strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions, partnerships or other strategic opportunities which involve risks. We may not realize the expected benefits of strategic acquisitions, partnerships or other strategic opportunities, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. The integration of an acquired business may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities or competitive responses. Other risks associated with future acquisitions, partnerships or other strategic opportunities include: the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with culture of the acquirer; technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, partnership or other strategic opportunity, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; faulty assumptions may be made regarding the integration process; unforeseen difficulties may arise\nin integrating operations, processes and systems; higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including information technology systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting; we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; higher than expected finance costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and attention. Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we have made strategic divestitures from time to time. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, which could impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including our ability to: effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser; identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and reduce fixed and other costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase our other products. These divestitures may on occasions also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees, supply and transition service agreements, deferred purchase consideration and other financial arrangements, any of which could impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are dependent upon a trained, dedicated sales force, the loss of which could materially affect our operations.\nMany of our products are sold and supported through dedicated staff and specifically trained personnel. The loss of this sales force due to market or other conditions could affect our ability to sell and support our products effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur results of operations are subject to exchange rate and other currency risks. A significant movement in exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations.\nSignificant portions of our businesses are conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results. Effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results cannot be predicted because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. We face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. In certain foreign countries, some components of our cost structure are denominated in U.S. dollars while our revenues are denominated in the local currency. In those cases, currency devaluation could adversely impact our operating margins.\nOur unfunded and underfunded defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement health care plans could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe cost of our defined benefit pension and post-retirement health care plans is recognized through operations over extended periods of time and involves many uncertainties during those periods of time. Our funding policy for defined benefit pension plans is to accumulate plan assets through our cash contributions and prudent investment returns, such that, over the long run, they will approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is materially affected by certain factors and assumptions, including the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, changes in the life expectancy of plan beneficiaries, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. Similarly, our post-retirement health care cost is materially affected by certain factors and assumptions, including the discount rate used to measure these obligations, as well as by changes in the actual cost of providing these medical benefits.\nWe have underfunded obligations under our U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately $67 million on a projected benefit obligation basis as of December 31, 2015. Declines in the value of the plan investments, the discount rate used to measure liabilities, increases in life expectancy of beneficiaries or unfavorable changes in law or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required funding. Additionally, we sponsor other foreign and non-qualified U.S. pension plans under which there are substantial unfunded liabilities totaling approximately $79 million on a projected benefit obligation basis as of December 31, 2015. Foreign regulatory authorities may seek to have\nChemtura and/or certain of our non-sponsoring subsidiaries take responsibility for some portion of these obligations. Mandatory funding contributions with respect to these obligations and potential unfunded benefit liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or future cash flows. In addition, we have unfunded post-retirement health care plan liabilities totaling approximately $94 million on a projected benefit obligation basis at December 31, 2015. Our actual costs with respect to our post-retirement health care plans could exceed our current actuarial projections.\nJoint venture investments that we enter into could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on joint venture partners\u2019 financial condition and disputes between us and our joint venture partners.\nA portion of our operations is conducted through certain ventures in which we share control with third parties. We may in the future enter into joint ventures in which we share control with third parties. In these situations, we are not in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the facility, partnership, joint venture or other entity. Investments through partnerships, joint ventures, or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, make poor business decisions or block or delay necessary decisions. Joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor our joint venture partners would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent the members of our management team from focusing their time and effort on our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, our joint venture partners might result in subjecting the facilities owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our joint venture partners.\nRestrictive covenants in our credit facilities may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions.\nOur credit facilities contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. The covenants limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness or repay certain indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends on or make other distributions on or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments, make investments, and enter into acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures. Such restrictions in our credit facilities could result in us having to obtain the consent of our lenders in order to take certain actions. We may be unable to obtain such consents from our lenders, or obtaining such consents may be difficult or costly for us. Our ability to expand our business or to address declines in our business may be limited if we are unable to obtain (or hindered from obtaining) such consents.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facilities and other debt obligations. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facilities immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our indebtedness. Our subsidiaries have pledged a significant portion of their assets as collateral under our credit facilities. If the lenders under credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and on the value of our stock.\nFuture events may impact our deferred tax asset position related to our utilization of net operating losses (\"NOLs\") and U.S deferred federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\nWe evaluate our ability to utilize deferred tax assets and our need for valuation allowances based on available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. In making this determination, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments (either increases or decreases), to a deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The utilization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry-back or carry-forward periods under the applicable tax law. Due to significant estimates used to establish a valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to a valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Changes to a valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, while we have no current intention to do so in the foreseeable\nfuture, should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings in foreign operations, a deferred tax liability may need to be established.\nIf our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we review our intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on July 31 of each year, or more frequently if required. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include, among others, those related to allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventories, environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement benefits expense, income taxes and the carrying value of goodwill and long-lived assets. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.\nWe depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business. If we fail to do so, our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to the fair presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Even effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event that our current control practices deteriorate, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our securities may be adversely affected.\nActions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. If activist stockholder activities ensue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. For example, we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial and communications advisors which could be costly. In addition,\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers and employees, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\nIf we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 500 million shares of common stock, of which 100.6 million shares were issued and 67.2 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015. Our board of directors (the \"Board\") has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock up to the authorized capital stated in the certificate of incorporation. Our Board may choose to issue some or all of such shares of common stock to acquire one or more businesses or to provide additional financing in the future. The issuance of any such shares of common stock may result in a reduction of the book value or market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Additionally, we have an incentive plan that allows for the issuance of up to 11 million shares (currently 4.3 million shares remain available for future grants).", "PERMNO": 38420, "SIC": 2820, "TIC": "CHMT"}
