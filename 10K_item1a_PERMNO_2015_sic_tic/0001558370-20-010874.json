RISK FACTORS\nA relatively small group of products may represent a significant portion of our revenues, gross profit, or net earnings from time to time.\nSales of a limited number of our products from time to time represent a significant portion of our revenues, gross profit and net earnings. For Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, our top five products in terms of sales, in the aggregate, represented approximately 45%, 52% and 58%, respectively, of our total net sales. If the volume or pricing of our largest selling products decline in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or share price could be materially adversely affected. See Item 1. Description of Business for more information on our top products.\nThe generic pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive.\nWe face strong competition in our generic product business. Revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic pharmaceutical products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors. Typically, as patents for brand-name products and related exclusivity periods expire or fall under patent challenges, the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for generic equivalents of such products is generally able to achieve significant market penetration. As competing off-patent manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products or as brand manufacturers launch generic versions of such products (for which no separate regulatory approval is required), market share, revenues and gross profit typically decline, in some cases dramatically. Accordingly, the level of market share, revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product is normally related to the number of competitors in that product\u2019s market and the timing of that product\u2019s regulatory approval and launch, in relation to competing approvals and launches. Consequently, we must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost-effective manner to maintain our revenues and gross margins.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, our operating results will suffer.\nOur future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new generic products in a timely manner. There are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new products, including:\n\u25cf developing, testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner;\n\u25cf receiving requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner;\n\u25cf the availability, on commercially reasonable terms, of raw materials, including APIs and other key ingredients;\n\u25cf developing and commercializing a new product is time consuming, costly and subject to numerous factors that may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of new products; and\n\u25cf commercializing generic products may be substantially delayed by unexpired patents covering the brand drug.\nAs a result of these and other difficulties, products currently in development by Lannett may or may not receive the regulatory approvals necessary for marketing. If any of our products, when developed and approved, cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, our operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped, even if we are successful in commercializing those products.\nRefer to the risk factor below related to the COVID-19 pandemic for further discussion of risks identified by the Company relating to the development and commercialization of new products.\nOur gross profit may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our product sales mix, our product pricing and our costs to manufacture or purchase products.\nOur future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows depend to a significant extent upon our product sales mix. Sales of certain products that we manufacture tend to create higher gross margins than the products we purchase and resell. As a result, our sales mix will significantly impact our gross profit from period to period.\nFactors that may cause our sales mix to vary include:\n\u25cf the number of new product introductions;\n\u25cf marketing exclusivity, if any, which may be obtained on certain new products;\n\u25cf the level of competition in the marketplace for certain products;\n\u25cf the availability of raw materials and finished products from our suppliers; and\n\u25cf the scope and outcome of governmental regulatory action that may involve us.\nThe Company is continuously seeking to keep product costs low, however there can be no guarantee that gross profit percentages will stay consistent in future periods. Pricing pressure from competitors, changes in product mix and the costs of producing or purchasing new drugs may also fluctuate in future periods.\nOur substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health.\nWe currently have substantial indebtedness. As of June 30, 2020, we had total outstanding debt of $708.0 million, of which $88.2 million is due within 12 months. The term loan A matures in November 2020 with $48.8 million outstanding as of June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, we also have an undrawn $125.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), which expires in November 2020. The Amended Term Loan Facility consists of an initial $910.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the \u201cSenior Secured Term Loan Facility\u201d), which was amended in June 2016 to include an additional $150.0 million incremental term loan (the \u201cIncremental Term Loan\u201d). The Amended Term Loan Facility, together with the Revolving Credit Facility comprises the amended senior secured credit facility (the \u201cAmended Senior Secured Credit Facility\u201d).\nOur substantial indebtedness may have important consequences for us. For example, it may:\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions and periods of significant inflation and financial market volatility;\n\u25cf expose us to the risk of increased interest rates, because any borrowings we make under the Revolving Facility and other borrowings under the Term Loan Facility under certain circumstances, will bear interest at variable rates;\n\u25cf require us to use a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other expenses;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u25cf limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.\nDue to many factors beyond our control, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and meet our other ongoing liquidity needs and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance, our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and we may not have available to us future borrowings in an amount sufficient, to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In these circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing will depend on, among other things:\n\u25cf our financial condition at the time;\n\u25cf restriction in the agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u25cf the condition of the financial markets and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u25cf our debt credit ratings.\nAs a result, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In such a case, we could be forced to sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures or issue equity securities to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances. The terms of the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility limit our ability to sell assets. In addition, we may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations. Any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness when due would permit the holders of such indebtedness to declare an event of default and accelerate the indebtedness. This could result in the lenders under the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility terminating their commitments to lend us money and foreclosing against the assets securing the borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. In August 2018, both Moody\u2019s and S&P reduced the Company\u2019s debt credit rating to \u201cB3\u201d and \u201cB-\u201d, respectively.\nThe Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility imposes operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions that may be potentially profitable or in our best interests.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility restrict and future debt instruments may restrict, subject to certain important exceptions and qualifications, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf make certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u25cf grant or permit certain liens on our assets;\n\u25cf enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf pay dividends, redeem our equity or make other restricted payments;\n\u25cf prepay, repurchase or redeem contractually subordinated debt and certain other debt;\n\u25cf merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets;\n\u25cf transfer, sell or dispose of property and assets; and\n\u25cf change the business we conduct or enter into new kinds of business.\nThese covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, engage in business activities, including future opportunities that may be in our interest and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If an event of default occurs, the relevant lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest, fees and other liabilities, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness. Acceleration of our other indebtedness could result in a default under the terms of the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility. There is no guarantee that we would be able to satisfy our obligations if any of our indebtedness is accelerated.\nIn addition, the limitations imposed in the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility on our ability to incur certain additional debt and to take other corporate actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. If, for any reason, we are unable to comply with the restrictions in the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility, we may not be granted waivers or amendments to such restrictions or we may not be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The lenders under the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we fail to meet any covenants in our Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility and cannot secure a waiver for such failure, the lenders under our Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility would be entitled to exercise various rights, including causing the amounts outstanding under the entire Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility to become immediately due and payable. If we were unable to pay such amounts, the lenders under the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility could recover amounts owed to them by foreclosing against the collateral pledged to them. We have pledged a substantial portion of our assets to the lenders under the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility, including the equity of our subsidiaries.\nOur Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility contains financial covenants and other restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility. We may not be able to comply with these covenants, which could result in the amounts outstanding under our Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility becoming immediately due and payable.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility requires us to comply with a first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 3.25:1.00 when there are outstanding loans and letters of credit (other than (i) drawn letters of credit that have been cash collateralized and (ii) up to $5.0 million of undrawn letters of credit) thereunder that exceed 30% of the aggregate commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Facility of $125.0 million as of the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter.\nIn addition, the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility is subject to a financial performance covenant, which provides that the Company shall not permit its secured net leverage ratio as of the last day of any four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than to 4.25:1.00 (with a step-down, occurring as of September 30, 2020, to 4.00:1.00).\nLastly, the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility is also subject to a minimum liquidity covenant, which provides that the Company shall not permit its liquidity as of the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than $75.0 million. For purposes of this covenant liquidity is defined as the sum of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility (calculated in the manner described in the following sentence) plus unrestricted cash. For purposes of this covenant, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is calculated as the amount available to be drawn other than any amount which if drawn would result in a breach of the Revolving Credit Facility financial covenant on a pro forma basis.\nAccordingly, if our liquidity and performance significantly worsens, we could become non-compliant with such covenants.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the Company was in compliance with the financial and other covenants included in our debt agreements. See Note. 9 \u201cLong-Term Debt.\u201d Based on our current projections, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity and cash flows to be able to meet our debt service requirements through June 30, 2021 and expects to be in compliance with its financial covenants through maturity of the Term Loan A in November 2020. If actual results for the year ending June 30, 2021 are less than the Company\u2019s current projections and/or if management\u2019s plans to offset the loss of the revenues and cash flows from the products distributed under the JSP Distribution Agreement are not successful, the Company could be in violation of its covenants, which may require significant accelerated payments of debt.\nWe are also subject to requirements to make mandatory prepayments, with the net proceeds of certain asset sales, excess cash flows and debt issuances. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand any downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, any of which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt and are not subject to such restrictions.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Based on total outstanding debt as of June 30, 2020 and the assumption that interest rates are above the interest rate floor set forth in the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility, each 1/8th percentage point change in interest rates would result in a $0.8 million change in annual interest expense on our outstanding debt under the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nManagement\u2019s plans to address the impact of the nonrenewal of the JSP Distribution Agreement may not be successful.\nNet sales of JSP products totaled $202.5 million in fiscal year 2019 and $253.1 million in fiscal year 2018. Our Distribution Agreement with JSP was not renewed when it expired on March 23, 2019. Management has implemented plans to offset the impact of the nonrenewal of the JSP Distribution Agreement. These plans currently include, among other things, an emphasis on reducing cost of sales, R&D and selling, general and administration (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses, continuing to accelerate new product launches, increasing its level of strategic partnerships and reducing capital expenditures. Management will also continue its emphasis on accelerating ANDA filings. However, the impact that these actions will have cannot be assured and they may not be sufficient to offset the impact, in whole or in part, of the loss of net sales, earnings or cash flows resulting from the nonrenewal of the JSP Distribution Agreement.\nPublic health threats, including a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States or elsewhere may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business may be adversely affected by public health threats, including any pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease occurring in the United States or worldwide. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was identified in Wuhan, China. This virus continues to spread globally and has spread to over 200 countries, including the United States, and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d). The spread of COVID-19 has impacted the global economy and may impact our business, operations and financial results.\nFor example, COVID-19 has resulted in significant governmental \u201csocial-distancing\u201d measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions and business shutdowns. Any business shutdowns or other business interruptions affecting our suppliers or interruptions in global shipping affecting our suppliers could result in our inability to continue receiving sufficient amount of finished dosage products, API and other raw materials. Any business shutdowns or other business interruptions affecting our business development and other strategic partners could also cause delays in the regulatory approval process for and launching of some or all of our\npipeline drug candidates. We cannot presently predict the duration and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the partners and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, while the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global economies and financial markets, reducing our ability to access funding sources and capital, and our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity and our results of operations.\nInfections and deaths related to COVID-19 may disrupt the United States\u2019 healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems. Such disruptions could divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay the FDA approval with respect to, our pending and future drug product applications. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. Additionally, subsequent to an initial stocking up of supplies at the start of the pandemic, the total volume of drug prescriptions written during the pandemic has decreased, causing less demand for our products. The length and severity of the pandemic may continue to affect the demand for our products in the future.\nIn line with the WHO recommendation to practice social distancing, individuals may be more reluctant to go to hospitals or see doctors, and hospitals and doctors may temporarily cease performing elective procedures, all of which could impact the number of overall prescriptions prescribed. Furthermore, we have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring all employees, other than employees in our manufacturing plants, distribution centers, and R&D facilities, who are able to work from home to work remotely. We have already suspended non-essential travel worldwide for our employees and are discouraging employee attendance at other gatherings. These measures could negatively affect our business. For instance, temporarily requiring many of our employees to work remotely may disrupt our operations or increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident.\nThe full extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, the severity of COVID-19 or the effectiveness of actions to contain and treat COVID-19, particularly in the geographies where we or our third party suppliers or business development and other strategic partners operate. Given the speed and frequency of continuously evolving developments with respect to this pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of any impact on our operations and the full extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business, results of operations, liquidity or financial position is uncertain.\nGovernmental investigations into sales and marketing practices in the generic pharmaceutical industry and claims by private parties relating to such investigations may result in substantial penalties or settlements.\nThere has been increased press coverage and increased scrutiny from regulatory and enforcement agencies and legislative bodies with respect to matters relating to the pricing of generic pharmaceuticals, including publicity and pressure resulting from prices charged by our competitors. We have experienced and may continue to experience downward pricing pressure on the price of our products due to competitive pressure to lower the cost of drugs to the ultimate consumer, which could reduce our revenue and future profitability. This increased press coverage and public scrutiny have resulted in, and may continue to result in, investigations, and calls for investigations, by governmental agencies at both the federal and state level and have resulted in, and may continue to result in, claims brought against us by private parties or by regulators taking other measures that could have a negative effect on our business. For a description of current, federal, and state investigations and claims by private parties, see Note 10 \u201cLegal, Regulatory Matters and Contingencies.\u201d Additional actions are possible. Responding to such investigations and claims is costly and involves a significant diversion of management attention. Such proceedings are unpredictable and may develop over lengthy periods of time. Future settlements may involve large monetary penalties. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of any such investigations or claims or what other investigations or lawsuits or regulatory responses may result from such assertions, or their impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or our stock price. Any such investigation or claim could also result in reputational harm and reduced market acceptance and demand for our products, could harm our ability to market our products in the future, could cause\nus to incur significant expense, could cause our senior management to be distracted from execution of our business strategy, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Accompanying the press and media coverage of pharmaceutical pricing practices and public complaints about the same, there has been increasing U.S. federal and state legislative and enforcement interest with respect to drug pricing. In recent years, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate have conducted numerous hearings with respect to pharmaceutical drug pricing practices, including in connection with the investigation of specific price increases by pharmaceutical companies. In addition to the effects of any investigations or claims brought against us described above, our revenue and future profitability could also be negatively affected if any such inquiries, of us or of other pharmaceutical companies or the industry more generally, were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products. Any of the events or developments described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as on our reputation.\nThe recent enactment of State laws affecting the pricing of our products could have the effect of reducing our profitability.\nSince 2016, several state legislatures have enacted laws regulating the pricing of various types of pharmaceutical products, including generic pharmaceutical products. These laws vary in applicability and scope, and generally require manufacturers to notify various state agencies of price increases over a given threshold for a given period of time and to include a justification for any price increases. At least one state law (subsequently struck by the court) authorized the state attorney general to seek civil penalties and disgorgement in the event a price increase is deemed unconscionable. To the extent these laws apply to our products, they could limit the prices which the company may charge for its products and reduce the company\u2019s profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future, and the value of any investment in our common stock could decline significantly.\nThe market price for our shares of common stock listed on the NYSE has fluctuated significantly from time to time, for example, varying between an intra-day high of $15.52 to an intra-day low of $5.46 during Fiscal 2020. Material amounts of short-selling of our common stock over the past few years has also increased the volatility of the market price for our common stock. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market, industry and other factors, including the risks described in this section. Further, the stock market for pharmaceutical companies has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, recent negative publicity regarding pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the market for pharmaceutical companies. These broad market and industry factors have negatively impacted, and in the future may seriously negatively impact, the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Our stock market price may also be dependent upon the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover our business. If our results do not meet these analysts\u2019 forecasts, the expectations of our investors or the financial guidance we provide to investors in any period, the market price of our common stock could decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market or significant price decline, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies and we have been subject to one such suit, as further described in Note 10 \u201cLegal, Regulatory Matters and Contingencies.\u201d Such suits could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we review our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and when there are changes in circumstances. We may be required to record additional significant charges to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined, resulting in a negative effect on our results of operations. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to further impairments in the future. In addition, we continue to review the potential divestment of certain assets as part of our future plans, which may lead to\nadditional impairments. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. For assets that are not impaired, we may adjust the remaining useful lives. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Any significant impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nExtensive industry regulation has had and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business in the area of cost of goods, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.\nAll pharmaceutical companies, including Lannett, are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulation by the federal government, including the FDA and, in the case of controlled drugs, the DEA and state government agencies. The FDCA, the CSA and other federal statutes, regulations and guidance govern or influence the development, testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products.\nThe process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time-consuming and costly and we cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental or third-party approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping our products. The FDA approval process for a particular product candidate can take several years and requires us to dedicate substantial resources to complete all activities necessary to secure approvals and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all. In order to obtain approval of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (\u201cANDAs\u201d) for our generic product candidates, we must demonstrate that our drug product is therapeutically equivalent and bioequivalent to a drug previously approved by the FDA through the drug approval process, known as the reference listed drug (\u201cRLD\u201d) or reference standard drug (\u201cRS\u201d). Bioequivalence may be demonstrated in vivo or in vitro by comparing the generic product candidate to the innovator drug product. Approval of our drug products that vary in certain ways from a brand name version of that drug may require a different FDA review process and application known as a 505(b)(2) NDA. Such 5050(b)(2) applications may require costly human clinical studies which may extend the time for approval of such drug product. Moreover, the FDA may request additional information and studies to support approval of an application, which could delay approval of the product and impair our ability to compete with other versions of the generic drug product.\nConsequently, there is always the chance that we will not obtain FDA or other necessary approvals, or that the rate, timing and cost of such approvals will adversely affect our product introduction plans or results of operations. We carry inventories of certain products in anticipation of launch and if such products are not subsequently launched, we may be required to write-off the related inventory. Furthermore, the FDA also has the authority to withdraw drug approvals previously granted after a hearing and require a firm to remove these products from the market for a variety of reasons, including a failure to comply with applicable regulations or the discovery of previously unknown safety problems with the product.\nAdditionally, certain products marketed prior to the enactment of the 1962 amendments to the FDCA may be considered \u201cgenerally recognized as safe and effective based on published scientific literature\u201d or \u201cGRASE.\u201d GRASE products are those \u201cold drugs that do not require prior approval from the FDA in order to be marketed.\u201d Similarly, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p)(1), also known as the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d, a product is exempted from the \u201ceffectiveness requirements [of the act] if its composition and labeling have not changed since 1962 and if, on the day before the 1962 amendments became effective, it was (1) used or sold commercially in the United States, (2) not a new drug as defined by the act at that time and (3) not covered by an effective application.\u201d FDA\u2019s current legal interpretation regarding GRASE status effectively limits the legal commercialization of such products. Moreover recently, the FDA has increased its efforts to force companies to file and seek FDA approval for Grandfathered products. FDA efforts included issuing notices to companies currently producing these products to cease its distribution of said products. Lannett currently manufactures and markets the unapproved product hyosyne solution/elixir.\nIn addition, facilities used to manufacture and/or test materials and drug products we market are subject to periodic inspection of facilities by the FDA, the DEA and other authorities to confirm that firms are in compliance with all applicable regulations. The FDA conducts pre-approval and/or post-approval inspections to determine whether systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. A Form 483 notice is generally issued at the\nconclusion of a FDA inspection and lists conditions the FDA inspectors believe may violate cGMP or other FDA regulations. If more serious violations are identified, the FDA may take additional action, such as issuing warning letters, import alerts, etc. The DEA and comparable state-level agencies also heavily regulate the manufacturing, holding, processing, security, record-keeping and distribution of drugs that are controlled substances. Lannett manufactures and/or distributes a variety of controlled substances. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its regulations. If our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it could result in regulatory action and additional costs.\nOur inability or the inability of our suppliers to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, delays in or denials of new product approvals, warning letters, import alerts, fines, consent decrees restricting or suspending manufacturing operations, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of sales and/or criminal prosecution. Any of these or other regulatory actions could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. Although we have instituted internal compliance programs, if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could materially harm our business. Additionally, if the FDA were to undertake additional enforcement activities with Lannett\u2019s Grandfathered products, their actions could result in, among other things, removal of some products from the market, seizure of the product and total or partial suspension of sales. Any of these regulatory actions could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing operations as well as our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing operations are subject to establishment registration by the FDA and periodic inspections by the FDA to assure compliance regarding the manufacturing of our products. If we or our suppliers do not maintain the current registrations or if we or our partners receive notices of manufacturing and quality-related observations following inspections by the FDA, our operating results would be materially negatively impacted.\nAll of our facilities as well as applicable contract/supplier facilities, rely on maintaining current FDA registration and other licenses to produce and develop generic drugs. If the Company does not successfully renew its FDA registrations, the financial results of Lannett would be negatively impacted. We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The FDA imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy. If we or our partners receive similar notices of manufacturing and quality-related observations and correspondence in the future, and if we are unable to resolve these observations and address the FDA\u2019s concerns in a timely fashion, our business, financial results and/or stock price could be materially affected.\nWe have and will continue to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of some of our drug candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these drug candidates.\nWe previously have and will continue in the future to seek third-party collaborators for the commercialization of some of our drug candidates on a selected basis, which adds a level of complexity to our supply network. If we do enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development of our drug candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. Many risks associated with relying on third-party collaborators for developing new products are beyond our control. For example, some of our collaboration partners may decide to make substantial changes to a product\u2019s formulation or design, may experience supply interruptions or financial difficulties or may have limited financial resources. Any of the foregoing may delay the development of new products or interrupt their market supply. In addition, if a third-party collaborator on a new product terminates our collaboration agreement or does not perform under the agreement, we may experience delays and additional costs in developing or replacing that product.\nRefer to the risk factor above related to the COVID-19 pandemic for further discussion of risks identified by the Company relating to third-party collaborators and the development of new products.\nThe loss of key personnel could cause our business to suffer.\nThe success of our present and future operations will depend, to a significant extent, upon the experience, abilities and continued services of our key personnel. If we lose the services of our key personnel, or if they are unable to devote sufficient attention to our operations for any other reason, our business may be significantly impaired. If the employment of any of our current key personnel is terminated, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and replace the employee with the same caliber of key personnel. As such, we have entered into employment agreements with all of our senior executive officers in order to help retain these key individuals.\nIf brand pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative and regulatory efforts, our sales of generic products may suffer.\nMany brand pharmaceutical companies have increasingly used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition. These efforts have included:\n\u25cf pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of one patent which could extend patent protection for additional years or otherwise delay the launch of generics;\n\u25cf using the Citizen Petition process to request amendments to FDA standards;\n\u25cf seeking changes to U.S. Pharmacopeia, an organization which publishes industry recognized compendia of drug standards;\n\u25cf attaching patent extension amendments to non-related federal legislation;\n\u25cf engaging in state-by-state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs, which could have an impact on products that we are developing;\n\u25cf persuading regulatory bodies to withdraw the approval of brand-name drugs for which the patents are about to expire and converting the market to another product of the brand company on which longer patent protection exists;\n\u25cf limiting the availability of certain RLDs, with Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (\u201cREMS\u201d) distribution requirements, to generic companies for bioequivalence testing required for ANDA premarket approval for commercialization;\n\u25cf entering into agreements whereby other generic companies will begin to market an AG, a generic equivalent of a branded product, at the same time or after generic competition initially enters the market;\n\u25cf filing suits for patent infringement and other claims that may delay or prevent regulatory approval, manufacture and/or scale of generic products; and,\n\u25cf introducing \u201cnext-generation\u201d products prior to the expiration of market exclusivity for the reference product, which often materially reduces the demand for the generic or the reference product for which we seek regulatory approval.\nIn the U.S., some pharmaceutical companies have lobbied Congress for amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act that would give them additional advantages over generic competitors. For example, although the term of a company\u2019s drug patent can be extended to reflect a portion of the time an NDA is under regulatory review, some companies have proposed extending the patent term by a full year for each year spent in clinical trials rather than the one-half year that is currently permitted.\nIf proposals like these were to become effective, or if any other actions by our competitors and other third parties to prevent or delay activities necessary to the approval, manufacture, or distribution of our products are successful, our entry into the market and our ability to generate revenues associated with new products may be delayed, reduced, or eliminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or share price.\nThe generic pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intellectual property litigation and third parties may claim that we infringe on their proprietary rights which could result in litigation that could be costly, result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and efforts, require us to pay damages or prevent us from marketing our existing or future products.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing or violating the intellectual property rights of others. The manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties. We may have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties. This is especially true in the case of generic products on which the patent covering the brand product is expiring, an area where infringement litigation is prevalent and in the case of new brand products in which a competitor has obtained patents for similar products. Our competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do and have made substantial intellectual property investments in competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patent rights and other intellectual property that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products. We may not be aware of whether our products do or will infringe existing or future patents or the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, patent applications can be pending for many years and may be confidential for a number of months after filing and because pending patent claims can be revised before issuance, there may be applications of others now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. Even if we prevail, litigation may be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf stop making, selling or using products or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property;\n\u25cf lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property rights against others;\n\u25cf incur significant legal expenses;\n\u25cf pay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u25cf pay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u25cf redesign or rename, in the case of trademark claims, those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and/or infeasible; or\n\u25cf attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or substantial royalties and could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a\nlicense or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all and there can be no assurance that we would be able to redesign our products in a way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Even if we were able to obtain rights to the third-party\u2019s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. As a result, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products, or force us to redesign or rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which, even if it is possible to so redesign or rename our products, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies from key suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of finished products or raw materials, our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded.\nWe are required to identify the supplier(s) of all the raw materials for our products in our applications with the FDA. To the extent practicable, we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application. However, some products and raw materials are available only from a single source and, in some of our drug applications, only one supplier of products and raw materials has been identified, even in instances where multiple sources exist. To the extent any difficulties experienced by our suppliers cannot be resolved within a reasonable time and at reasonable cost, or if raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier and we are required to qualify a new supplier with the FDA, our profit margins and market share for the affected product could decrease and our development and sales and marketing efforts could be delayed.\nOur policies regarding returns, allowances and chargebacks and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers may reduce our revenues in future fiscal periods.\nBased on industry practice, generic drug manufacturers have liberal return policies and have been willing to give customers post-sale inventory allowances. Under these arrangements, from time to time we give our customers credits on our generic products that our customers hold in inventory after we have decreased the market prices of the same generic products due to competitive pricing. Therefore, if new competitors enter the marketplace and significantly lower the prices of any of their competing products, we would likely reduce the price of our products. As a result, we would likely be obligated to provide credits to our customers who are then holding inventories of such products, which could reduce sales revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided. Like our competitors, we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesalers that have contracts with us for their sales to hospitals, group purchasing organizations, pharmacies or other customers.\nA chargeback is the difference between the price the wholesaler pays and the price that the wholesaler\u2019s end-customer pays for a product. Although we establish reserves based on our prior experience and our best estimates of the impact that these policies may have in subsequent periods, we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns, allowances and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates.\nHealth care initiatives and other third-party payor cost-containment pressures have and could continue to cause us to sell our products at lower prices, resulting in decreased revenues.\nSome of our products are purchased or reimbursed by state and federal government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations, or HMOs and managed care organizations, or MCOs. Third-party payors increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing. There also continues to be a trend toward managed health care in the United States. Pricing pressures by third-party payors and the growth of organizations such as HMOs and MCOs could result in lower prices and a reduction in demand for our products.\nOne such governmental program, known as the 340B Program, requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into an agreement, called a pharmaceutical pricing agreement (PPA), with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Under the PPA, the manufacturer agrees to provide front-end discounts on covered outpatient drugs purchased by specified providers, called \u201ccovered entities,\u201d that serve the nation\u2019s most vulnerable patient populations. Outpatient prescription drugs, over the counter drugs (accompanied by a prescription), and clinic-administered drugs within eligible facilities are covered.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments to reform health care and government insurance programs could significantly influence the manner in which pharmaceutical products and medical devices are prescribed and purchased. We expect there will continue to be federal and state laws and/or regulations, proposed and implemented, that could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services. The extent to which future legislation or regulations, if any, relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business remains uncertain. For example, H.R.987, the \u201cStrengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act,\u201d which incorporated a bipartisan effort to address prescription drug pricing combined with broader provisions protecting the Affordable Care Act, was passed by the House of Representatives on May 16, 2019, but it is not expected to pass in the Senate. The bill does represent bipartisan consensus on the need to reform the drug pricing system. Another bill, the Lower Drugs Now Act of 2019 would give Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices. Other proposals include the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, and the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Medicare Program, IPI Model for Medicare Part B Drugs, issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Such measures or other health care system reforms that are adopted could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and our ability to successfully commercialize our products or could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.\nWe may need to change our business practices to comply with changes to fraud and abuse laws.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including the Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Statute (the \u201cAnti-Kickback Statute\u201d), which apply to our sales and marketing practices and our relationships with physicians and other referral sources. At the federal level, the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying any remuneration, including a bribe, kickback, or rebate, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce the referral of patients for items or services covered by federal health care programs, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for products or services covered by federal health care programs. Federal health care programs have been defined to include plans and programs that provide health benefits funded by the federal government, including Medicare and Medicaid, among others. The definition of \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the federal Anti-Kickback Statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if even one purpose in an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals or otherwise generate business involving goods or services reimbursed in whole or in part under federal health care programs, the statute has been violated. The federal government has issued regulations, commonly known as safe harbors that set forth certain provisions which, if fully met, will assure parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement will be illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued, but such transactions or arrangements face an increased risk of scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and an ongoing risk of prosecution. If our sales and marketing practices or our relationships with physicians are considered by federal or state enforcement authorities to be knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or providing any remuneration in exchange for arranging for or recommending our products and services and such activities do not fit within a safe harbor, then these arrangements could be challenged under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines of up to $100,000 per violation, civil monetary penalties of up to $100,000 per violation, assessments of up to three times the amount of the prohibited remuneration, imprisonment and exclusion from participating in the federal health care programs. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute also may result in a finding of civil liability under the FFCA (as further discussed below) and the potential imposition of additional civil fines and\nmonetary penalties that could be substantial. Falsely certifying compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute in connection with a claim submitted to a federally funded insurance program is actionable under the FFCA. In addition, HIPAA and its implementing regulations created two new federal crimes: health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The HIPAA health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statue is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. The HIPAA false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services.\nA number of states also have anti-fraud and anti-kickback laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments if such arrangements are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients or the furnishing of goods or services. Some states\u2019 anti-fraud and anti-kickback laws apply only to goods and services covered by Medicaid. Other states\u2019 anti-fraud and anti-kickback laws apply to all health care goods and services, regardless of whether the source of payment is governmental or private. Due to the breadth of these laws and the potential for changes in laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nCertain federal and state governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, have been investigating issues surrounding pricing information reported by drug manufacturers and used in the calculation of reimbursements as well as sales and marketing practices. For example, many government and third-party payors, historically including Medicare and Medicaid, reimburse doctors and others for the purchase of certain pharmaceutical products based on the product\u2019s average wholesale price (\u201cAWP\u201d) reported by pharmaceutical companies, although the Company has not used the term AWP since 2000. Medicare currently uses average sales price (\u201cASP\u201d) and wholesale acquisition cost (\u201cWAC\u201d) when ASP data is unavailable. The federal government, certain state agencies and private payors are investigating and have begun to file court actions related to pharmaceutical companies\u2019 reporting practices with respect to AWP, alleging that the practice of reporting prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in a false and overstated AWP, which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries, insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans and others to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products. In addition, some of these same payors are also alleging that companies are not reporting their \u201cbest price\u201d to the states under the Medicaid program.\nFurthermore, under the FDCA, it is illegal for pharmaceutical companies to promote their products for uses that are not approved by the FDA, and companies that market drugs for so-called \u201coff-label\u201d indications may be subject to civil liability under the FFCA (as further discussed below), as well as to criminal penalties. Over the past decade, numerous lawsuits have been filed against pharmaceutical companies challenging their off-label promotional activities, and pharmaceutical companies, in the aggregate, have paid billions of dollars to defend and settle these cases.\nWe may become subject to federal and state false claims litigation brought by private individuals and the government.\nWe are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement. The FFCA imposes civil liability on individuals or entities that knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. Violations of the FFCA and other similar laws may result in criminal fines, imprisonment and substantial civil penalties for each false claim submitted (including civil penalties presently in excess of $23,330 per claim, plus treble damages, plus liability for attorney\u2019s fees) and exclusion from federally funded health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The FFCA also allows private individuals to bring a suit on behalf of the government against an individual or entity for violations of the FFCA. These suits, also known as Qui Tam or whistleblower actions, may be brought by, with only a few exceptions, any private citizen who has material information of a false claim that has not yet been previously disclosed. These suits have increased significantly in recent years because the FFCA allows an individual to share in the amounts paid to the federal government in fines or settlement as a result of a successful Qui Tam action, in addition to the recovery of legal fees in bringing such an action. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be\nsubject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment, or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nRecently, the Department of Justice has begun to use the 1961 federal Travel Act as a tool to pursue criminal charges in the case of health care kickback and commercial bribery allegations. This law was enacted as part of the Kennedy administration\u2019s war on organized crime. It formed the basis for a federal enforcement action against a Texas physician-owned specialty hospital and a number of surgeons and administrators, who were convicted of conspiring to pay or receive bribes in exchange for referrals of patients in violation of a state commercial bribery law. Importantly, this case was not limited to claims covered under federal programs, and the failure of the state to bring charges under its own statute did not prevent the federal case from proceeding. The Travel Act may be used by the Department of Justice as a way to expand its reach to penalize kickbacks and similar arrangements even when the Anti-Kickback Statute and FFCA would not apply. These efforts could increase our vulnerability to litigation and penalties if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of applicable law.\nSales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our distribution network and the concentration of our customer base.\nOur principal customers are wholesale drug distributors, major retail drug store chains and mail order pharmacies. These customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the U.S. This distribution network has undergone significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains. As a result, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased. We expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers, including Lannett.\nOur net sales may also be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of retail chains, mail order distributors, wholesalers and other trade buyers, whether resulting from pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors.\nOur three largest customers accounted for 25%, 23% and 11%, respectively, of our total net sales for Fiscal 2020 and 21%, 18% and 12%, respectively, of our total net sales for Fiscal 2019. The loss of any of these customers, any financial difficulties experienced by any of these customers or any delay in receiving payments from such customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our cash flows. In addition, the Company generally does not enter into long-term supply agreements with its customers that would require them to purchase our products.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity and data leakage risks.\nSignificant disruptions to our information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information) and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We could be susceptible to third-party attacks on our information technology systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including state and quasi-state actors, criminal groups, \u201chackers\u201d and others. Maintaining the security, confidentiality and integrity of this confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary, business information and personal information) is important to our competitive business position. There can be no assurance that we can prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems or the unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful use or disclosure of confidential information that could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential\ninformation. A breach of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information, or other confidential information, whether as a result of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, or for any other cause, could enable others to produce competing products, use our proprietary technology or information and/or adversely affect our business position. Further, any such interruption, security breach, or loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of confidential information could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe design, development, manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims by consumers and other third parties and insurance against such potential claims is expensive and may be difficult to obtain.\nThe design, development, manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity. Insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance for our products in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable, if the coverage limits of these insurance policies are not adequate, a claim brought against Lannett, whether covered by insurance or not, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRising insurance costs, as well as the inability to obtain certain insurance coverage for risks faced by us, could negatively impact profitability.\nThe cost of insurance, including workers compensation, product liability and general liability insurance, has risen in recent years and may increase in the future. In response, we may increase deductibles and/or decrease certain coverage to mitigate these costs. These increases and our increased risk due to increased deductibles and reduced coverage, could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAdditionally, certain insurance coverage may not be available to us for risks faced by us. Sometimes the coverage we obtain for certain risks may not be adequate to fully reimburse the amount of damage that we could possibly sustain. Should either of these events occur, the lack of insurance to cover our entire cost would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of brand and generic products could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, companies are now required to file with the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and the Department of Justice certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of brand drugs. This new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with brand pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the FTC or other governmental authorities. The impact of this new requirement and the potential private-party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand-name and generic drug manufacturers is uncertain and could adversely affect our business.\nWe expend a significant amount of resources on research and development efforts that may not lead to successful product introductions.\nWe conduct R&D primarily to enable us to gain approval for, manufacture, and market pharmaceuticals in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We also partner with third parties to develop products. We cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products will be recovered, even if we are successful in commercialization. To the extent that we expend significant resources on R&D efforts and are not able, ultimately, to introduce successful new and/or complex products as a result of those efforts, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our common stock.\nInvestigations of the calculation of average wholesale prices may adversely affect our business.\nMany government and third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, Health Maintenance Organization and Managed Care Organization, have historically reimbursed doctors, pharmacies and others for the purchase of certain prescription drugs based on a drug\u2019s AWP or WAC. In the past several years, state and federal government agencies have conducted ongoing investigations of manufacturers\u2019 reporting practices with respect to AWP and WAC, in which they have suggested that reporting of inflated AWP\u2019s or WAC\u2019s has led to excessive payments for prescription drugs. For a description of current and federal and state investigations and claims by private parties, see Note 10 \u201cLegal, Regulatory Matters and Contingencies.\u201d Additional actions are possible. These actions, if successful, could adversely affect us and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOther manufacturers and distributors of pain management products have had complaints filed against and investigations commenced on them, and if similar actions are taken against us, it could reduce our revenue and future profitability.\nDuring the past few years, a number of complaints have been filed with respect to sales and distribution of various types of pain management medications against various pharmaceutical companies (not including Lannett), by a number of cities, counties and states across the country alleging among other things that such companies failed to develop and implement systems sufficient to identify suspicious orders of such products and prevent the diversion of such products to individuals who used them for other than legitimate medical purposes. The complaints generally contend that the defendants allegedly engaged in improper marketing of pain management products, and seek a variety of remedies, including restitution, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, treble damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and injunctive relief. In addition, a number of State Attorneys General, including a coordinated multistate effort, have initiated investigations into sales and marketing practices of various pharmaceutical companies (not including Lannett) with respect to such pain management products. If any similar investigations or claims are commenced against us, it could result in reputational harm and reduced market acceptance and demand for our products, could harm our ability to market our products in the future, could cause us to incur significant expense, could cause our senior management to be distracted from execution of our business strategy, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our pain management products.\nGovernment agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health and science foundations and organizations from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the healthcare and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups or organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of concomitant therapies. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines about the use of pain management products for chronic pain, the FDA has issued an Opioid Action Plan and in 2017 President Trump signed an executive order establishing the President\u2019s Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction. Additionally, the FDA has required all opioid products, including immediate release drugs, to join a shared REMS program that educates healthcare providers to reduce serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, misuse, and abuse of opioid analgesics while maintaining patient access to pain medications. REMS participation has added significant costs to the Company. Recommendations or guidelines suggesting the reduced use of our products or the use of competitive or alternative products as the standard of care to be followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAcquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into\ndiscussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. We may compete for certain acquisition targets with companies having greater financial resources than us or other advantages over us that may hinder or prevent us from acquiring a target company or completing another transaction, which could also result in significant diversion of management time, as well as substantial out-of-pocket costs. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we may face risks include but are not limited to (i) diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges, (ii) implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company, (iii) integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource and other administrative systems and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions, (iv) transition of operations, users and customers onto our existing platforms, (v) failure to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if at all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition, (vi) cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire and (vii) liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, claims from current and former employees and customers and other known and unknown liabilities.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.\nThe phase out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or if alternative rates or benchmarks will be adopted. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks.", "PERMNO": 89369, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "LCI"}
