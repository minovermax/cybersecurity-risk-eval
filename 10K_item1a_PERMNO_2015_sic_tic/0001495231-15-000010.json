{"cik": "1495231", "company": "IZEA, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information set forth at the beginning of Management's Discussion and Analysis entitled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\", investors should consider that there are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of losses, expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability or obtain the financing necessary for future growth.\nWe have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flow from operations since our inception which has resulted in a total accumulated deficit of $22,941,350 as of December 31, 2014. Although our revenue has increased since inception, we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain these growth rates or realize sufficient revenue to achieve profitability. If we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nWe are developing a new platform to process all of our existing business transactions and grow our operations, but cannot provide any assurance regarding its commercial success.\nWe are developing a new platform called the IZEA Exchange (IZEAx) which is currently in public beta. IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation of multiple types of content through a wide variety of social channels. IZEAx is a brand-new system, engineered from the ground-up to replace all of our current platforms with an integrated offering that is improved and more efficient for the company to operate. Our intention is to focus all of our engineering resources on the IZEAx platform for the foreseeable future. We are spending a significant amount of time and resources on the development of this platform, but we cannot provide any assurances of its short or long-term commercial success or growth. A portion of the proceeds of our private placement completed in February 2014 (\"2014 Private Placement\") was used for completion of the IZEAx platform, which is scheduled for continued updates and enhancements into the foreseeable future. There is no assurance that the amount of money being allocated for the platform will be sufficient to complete it, or that such completion will result in significant revenues or profit for us. If our advertisers and creators do not perceive this platform to be of high value and quality, we may not be able to retain them or acquire new advertisers and creators. Additionally, if existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over this platform, demand for IZEAx may decrease and our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected.\nWe have a limited operating history and are subject to the risks encountered by early-stage companies.\nBecause we have a limited operating history, we encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by early-stage companies in rapidly evolving markets. For us, these risks include:\n\u2022\nrisks associated with our dependence on our platforms and related services for the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future;\n\u2022\nrisks that our growth strategy may not be successful in terms of greater revenue and profitability; and\n\u2022\nrisks that fluctuations in our operating results will be significant causing volatility in our stock price.\nOur future growth will depend substantially on our ability to address these and the other risks described in this section. If we do not successfully address these risks, our business would be significantly harmed.\nWe have experienced rapid growth over a short period in our social sponsorship platforms and we do not know whether this will continue to develop or whether it can be maintained. If we are unable to successfully respond to changes in the market, our business could be harmed.\nOur business has grown rapidly as advertisers and creators have increasingly used our social sponsorship platforms. However, the social sponsorship industry is relatively new. Given the limited history, it is difficult to predict whether our platforms will continue to grow or whether it can be maintained. We expect that the platforms will evolve in ways that may be difficult to predict. It is possible that advertisers and creators could broadly determine that they no longer believe in the value of our current platforms. In the event of these or any other changes to the market, our continued success will depend on our ability to successfully adjust our strategy to meet the changing market dynamics. If we are unable to do so, our business, prospects, results of operation and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nDelays in releasing enhanced versions of our products and services could adversely affect our competitive position.\nAs part of our strategy, we expect to periodically release enhanced versions of our premier platforms and related services. Even if our new versions contain the features and functionality our customers want, in the event we are unable to timely introduce these new product releases, our competitive position may be harmed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the development of currently planned or future products in a timely and efficient manner. Due to the complexity of these products, internal quality assurance testing and customer testing of pre-commercial releases may reveal product performance issues or desirable feature enhancements that could lead us to postpone the release of these new versions. In addition, the reallocation of resources associated with any postponement would likely cause delays in the development and release of other future products or enhancements to our currently available products. Any delay in releasing other future products or enhancements of our products could cause our financial results to be adversely impacted.\nWe may not successfully integrate our recent Ebyline acquisition to realize the full benefits of the combined business.\nOur recent acquisition of Ebyline involves the integration of a business that had previously operated separately. The difficulties of combining the operations of this business include:\n\u2022the challenge of effecting technical integration while carrying on our ongoing businesses;\n\u2022the necessity of coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u2022effective integration of personnel with diverse business backgrounds.\nThe process of completing the integration of this business could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our company and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the acquisition and the integration of Ebyline\u2019s operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur growth strategy depends, in part, on our acquiring companies, technologies and assets and adding them to our portfolio of software services to drive additional near and long-term revenue, which we may be unable to do.\nOur growth strategy is based, in part, on our ability to acquire companies, technologies and assets. The success of this acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to accomplish the following:\n\u2022identify suitable companies, technologies or assets to buy;\n\u2022complete the purchase of those businesses on terms acceptable to us;\n\u2022complete the acquisition(s) in the time frame and within the budget we expect; and\n\u2022improve the results of operations of each of the businesses that we buy and successfully integrate its operations on an accretive basis.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in any or all of the factors above. Our failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy could have an adverse effect on other aspects of our business strategy and our business in general. We may not be able to find appropriate acquisition candidates, accretively acquire those candidates that we identify or integrate acquired businesses effectively and profitably.\nWe (and others) are currently defending a patent infringement claim related to peer-to-peer advertising between mobile communication devices seeking unspecified damages, which may materially impact our business.\nOn October 17, 2012, Blue Calypso, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Blue Calypso\u2019s complaint alleges that we infringe on their patents related to peer-to-peer advertising between mobile communication devices and seeks unspecified damages. On July 19, 2013, Blue Calypso\u2019s case against us was consolidated, along with patent infringement cases against Yelp, Inc. and Foursquare Labs, Inc., into Blue Calypso, Inc. v. Groupon, Inc. for all pretrial purposes, including discovery and claim construction.\nOn December 16, 2013, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board\u2019s (PTAB) instituted a Covered Business Method Review (CBMR) for three of the five patents Blue Calypso asserts in its case against IZEA. In its decisions granting the CMBRs, the PTAB explained that several of Blue Calypso\u2019s asserted patents are likely invalid. In particular, the PTAB found it more likely than not that each of these three patents was invalid based on two independent grounds of anticipation, and one ground of obviousness. Additionally, the PTAB preliminarily found it more likely than not that many of the claims of one of Blue Calypso\u2019s patents were invalid due to a lack of written description. On January 17, 2014, the PTAB expanded its review to all five of Blue Calypso\u2019s assert patents. The PTAB\u2019s final decision regarding the asserted patents is expected by the end of this year. On January 16, 2014, the court granted a joint motion to stay Blue Calypso\u2019s patent infringement case until the PTAB\u2019s\nreview of Blue Calypso\u2019s asserted patents is complete. On January 17, 2014, the PTAB expanded its review to all five of Blue Calypso\u2019s assert patents.\nOn December 16, 2014, the PTAB issued its Final Decisions concerning the five patents-in-suit. The Final Decisions eliminated the vast majority of claims asserted by Blue Calypso. While some claims did survive the PTAB\u2019s Final Decisions, those claims are potentially invalid in view of factual findings made by the PTAB. The PTAB decisions are now on appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The potential outcomes of these appeals ranges from invalidation of all of Blue Calypso\u2019s asserted claims to complete reversal of the PTAB\u2019s Final Decisions.\nIn view of the pending appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Defendants, including IZEA, have requested that the Eastern District of Texas Court keep the pending stay in place until resolution of the appeals. The Court has not yet ruled on Defendants\u2019 motion to keep the stay in place.\nAt this stage, we do not have an estimate of the likelihood or the amount of any potential exposure to us. Although we believe that there is no merit to Blue Calypso\u2019s suit, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in the suit. In the event that a favorable outcome for us is not obtained, we could potentially be limited in certain ways in the use of our current social sponsorship platforms. Even if the litigation is resolved in our favor, it is possible that the litigation will be protracted, resulting in substantial legal costs to defend against the action and the diversion of management's attention and other resources of our company. In either event, the continuation of this action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe social sponsorship landscape is subject to numerous changes that could cause our revenue to decline.\nOur business model may not continue to be effective in the future for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nsocial sponsorship is, by its nature, limited in content relative to other media;\n\u2022\ncompanies may be reluctant or slow to adopt social sponsorship that replaces, limits or competes with their existing direct marketing efforts;\n\u2022\ncompanies may prefer other forms of advertising we do not offer, including certain forms of search engine placements;\n\u2022\ncompanies, such as Facebook and Twitter, may no longer grant us access to their websites in connection with our social sponsorship platforms;\n\u2022\ncompanies may not utilize social sponsorship due to concerns of \u201cclick-fraud\u201d particularly related to search engine placements (\u201cclick-fraud\u201d is a form of online fraud when a person or computer program imitates a legitimate user by clicking on an advertisement for the purpose generating a charge per click without having an actual interest in the target of the advertisement's link); and\n\u2022\nregulatory actions may negatively impact certain business practices that we currently rely on to generate a portion of our revenue and profitability.\nIf the number of companies that purchase social sponsorship from us or the size of the sponsorship campaigns does not grow, our revenue could decline which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to retain our existing creators, our revenue and business will be harmed.\nWe must continue to retain and acquire creators that publish sponsorships through IZEAx in order to increase revenue and achieve profitability. If creators do not perceive our products and services to be of high value and quality or if we fail to provide value with IZEAx, we may not be able to acquire or retain creators. If we are unable to acquire new creators in numbers sufficient to grow our business, or if creators cease using our products and services, the revenue we generate may decrease and our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that many of our new creators originate from word of mouth and other referrals from existing creators, and therefore we must ensure that our existing creators remain loyal to our service in order to continue receiving those referrals. If our efforts to satisfy our existing creators are not successful, we may not be able to acquire new creators in sufficient numbers to continue to grow our business or we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenses in order to acquire new creators.\nIf we fail to retain existing advertisers or add new advertisers, our revenue and business will be harmed.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain advertisers that are prepared to offer products or services on compelling terms through IZEAx. We must continue to attract and retain advertisers in order to increase revenue and achieve profitability. If new advertisers do not find our marketing and promotional services effective, or if existing advertisers do not believe that utilizing our platforms provides them with a long-term increase in customers, revenue or profit, they may stop advertising\nthrough our platforms. In addition, we may experience attrition in our advertisers in the ordinary course of business resulting from several factors, including losses to competitors, closures or bankruptcies. If we are unable to attract new advertisers in numbers sufficient to grow our business, or if too many advertisers are unwilling to offer products or services with compelling terms to our creators through our platforms or if too many large advertisers seek extended payment terms, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIntense competition in our target market could impair our ability to grow and to achieve profitability.\nThe market for native advertising is highly competitive. We expect this competition to continue to increase, in part because there are no significant barriers to entry to our industry. Increased competition may result in price reductions for advertising space, reduced margins and loss of market share. Our principal competitors include other companies that provide advertisers with Internet advertising solutions and companies that offer pay per click search services.\nCompetition for advertising placements among current and future suppliers of Internet navigational and informational services, high traffic websites and social sponsorship providers, as well as competition with other media for native advertising placements, could result in significant price competition, declining margins and reductions in advertising revenue. In addition, as we continue our efforts to expand the scope of our services, we may compete with a greater number of other media companies across an increasing range of different services, including in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition and other areas. If existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over those offered by us, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected. We also compete with traditional advertising media, such as direct mail, television, radio, cable and print for a share of advertisers' total advertising budgets. Many current and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater access to advertising space on high-traffic websites, and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we fail to compete successfully, we could lose customers or advertising inventory and our revenue and results of operations could decline.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, or if we receive unfavorable media coverage, our ability to expand our base of creators and advertisers will be impaired and our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe believe that the brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the \"IZEA\" brand is critical to expanding our base of creators and advertisers. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain the \"IZEA\" brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our platforms, applications, practices or service offerings, or the offerings of our advertisers, could adversely affect our reputation, resulting in difficulties in recruiting, decreased revenue and a negative impact on the number of advertisers and the size of our creator base, the loyalty of our creators and the number and variety of sponsorships we offer each day. As a result, our business, prospects, results of operation and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur total number of registered creators may be higher than the number of our actual individual creators and may not be representative of the number of persons who are active potential creators.\nOur total number of registered creators IZEAx may be higher than the number of our actual individual creators because some creators have multiple registrations, other creators may have died or become incapacitated and others may have registered under fictitious names. Given the challenges inherent in identifying these creators, we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual individual creators, and thus we rely on the number of total registered creators as our measure of the size of our creator base. In addition, the number of creators includes the total number of individuals that have completed registration through a specific date, less individuals who have unsubscribed, and should not be considered as representative of the number of persons who continue to actively create to fulfill the sponsorships offered through our platforms.\nOur total number of registered advertisers may be higher than the number of our actual individual advertisers and may not be representative of the number of persons or companies who are active potential advertisers.\nOur total number of registered advertisers IZEAx may be higher than the number of our actual individual advertisers because some advertisers have multiple registrations and other advertisers may no longer have a need for advertising or be in business. Given the challenges inherent in identifying these advertisers, we do not have a reliable system to accurately identify the number of actual individual advertisers, and thus we rely on the number of total registered advertisers as our measure of the size of our advertiser base. In addition, the number of advertisers includes the total number of advertisers that have completed registration through a specific date, less advertisers who have unsubscribed, and should not be considered as representative of the number of advertisers who continue to actively create to fulfill the sponsorships offered through our platforms.\nWe may become subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business, thereby adversely affecting our financial results.\nWe are not currently subject to direct regulation by any domestic or foreign governmental agency, other than regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws or regulations directly applicable to Internet commerce. However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the social media, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may become applicable to us or may be adopted in the future with respect to the Internet covering issues such as:\n\u2022\ntruth-in-advertising;\n\u2022\nuser privacy;\n\u2022\ntaxation;\n\u2022\nright to access personal data;\n\u2022\ncopyrights;\n\u2022\ndistribution; and\n\u2022\ncharacteristics and quality of services.\nThe applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property, encryption, taxation, libel, export or import matters and personal privacy to social media platforms is uncertain. The vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the broad commercial use of social media platforms and related technologies. As a result, they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of social media and related technologies. Changes to these laws intended to address these issues, including some recently proposed changes, could create uncertainty in the social media marketplace. Such uncertainty could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased costs of litigation or increased service delivery costs.\nOur social sponsorship business is subject to the risks associated with word of mouth advertising and endorsements, such as violations of the \u201ctruth-in-advertising,\u201d FTC Guides and other similar regulatory requirements and, more generally, loss of consumer confidence.\nWe do not engage in targeted or online behavioral advertising practices, nor do we compile or use information concerning consumer behavior on an individual level, but we may do so from time to time in the aggregate and on an anonymous basis to analyze our services and offerings, and better optimize them for improved business results. As the practice of targeted advertising has become increasingly scrutinized by both regulators and the industry alike, a greater emphasis has been placed on educating consumers about their privacy choices on the Internet, and providing them with the right to opt in or opt out of certain industry practices, such as targeted advertising. The common thread throughout both targeted advertising and the FTC requirements described in detail in the section \"Business - Government Regulation\" is the increased importance placed on transparency between the advertiser and the consumer to ensure that consumers know the difference between \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201cadvertising\u201d on the Internet, and are afforded the opportunity to decide how their data will be used in the manner to which they are marketed. There is a risk regarding negative consumer perception \u201cof the practice of undisclosed compensation of social media users to endorse specific products\u201d which pertains to a risk of overall general public confidence in the FTC's ability to enforce its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising in social media. As described in the section \"Business - Government Regulation,\" we undertake various measures through controls across our platforms and by monitoring and enforcing our code of ethics to ensure that advertisers and creators comply with the FTC Guides when utilizing our sites, but if competitors and other companies do not, it could create a negative overall perception for the industry. Not only will readers stop relying on blogs for useful, timely and insightful information that enrich their lives by having access to up-to-the-minute information that often bears different perspectives and philosophies, but a lack of compliance will almost inevitably result in greater governmental oversight and involvement in an already-highly regulated marketplace. If there is pervasive overall negative perception caused by others not complying with FTC Guides among its other acts, regulations and policies, then this could result in reduced revenue and results of operations and higher compliance costs for us.\nNew tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our services and our financial results.\nDue to the global nature of social media, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations may subject us or our creators to additional sales, income and other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on commerce over social media. New or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling goods and services over social media. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data, and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international privacy laws and regulations, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new privacy laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business.\nA variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. The existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy matters. For example, recently there have been Congressional hearings and increased attention to the capture and use of location-based information relating to users of smartphones and other mobile devices. We have posted privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of creator data on our websites and platforms. Several internet companies have incurred penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices. In addition, several states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, FTC requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could result in a loss of creators or advertisers and adversely affect our business. Federal, state and international governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third-party web \"cookies\" for behavioral advertising. The regulation of these cookies and other current online advertising practices could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain and scale the network infrastructure necessary to operate our platforms and applications, and any significant disruption in service on our platforms and applications could result in a loss of creators or advertisers.\nCreators and advertisers access our services through our platforms and applications. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our creators and advertisers are dependent upon the reliable performance of our platforms and applications and the underlying network infrastructure. As our creator base continues to grow, we will need an increasing amount of network capacity and computing power. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts for data centers and equipment and related network infrastructure to handle the traffic on our platforms and applications. The operation of these systems is expensive and complex and could result in operational failures. In the event that our creator base or the amount of traffic on our platforms and applications grows more quickly than anticipated, we may be required to incur significant additional costs. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our platforms and applications, and prevent our creators and advertisers from accessing our services. A substantial portion of our network infrastructure is hosted by third-party providers. Any disruption in these services or any failure of these providers to handle existing or increased traffic could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. If we do not maintain or expand our network infrastructure successfully or if we experience operational failures, we could lose current and potential creators and advertisers, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our platforms, our platforms and applications may be perceived as not being secure, advertisers and creators may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur platforms and applications and the network infrastructure that is hosted by third-party providers involve the storage and transmission of advertiser and creator proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and potential liability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, security flaws in the third party hosting service that we rely upon or any number of other reasons and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our advertisers' or creators' data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, advertisers or creators to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our advertisers' or creators' data. Although we do have security measures in place, we have had instances where some customers have used fraudulent credit cards in order to pay for our services. While these breaches of our security did not result in material harm to our business, any future breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our platforms and applications that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain and use unauthorized credit cards, obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures on a timely basis. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose advertisers, creators and vendors and have difficulty obtaining merchant processors or insurance coverage essential for our operations.\nIf our technology platforms contain defects, we may need to suspend their availability and our business and reputation would be harmed.\nPlatforms as complex as ours often contain unknown and undetected errors or performance problems. Many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial release of new platforms or enhancements to existing platforms. Although we attempt to resolve all errors that we believe would be considered serious by our customers before making our platforms available to them, our products are not error-free. These errors or performance problems could result in lost revenues or delays in customer acceptance that would be detrimental to our business and reputation. We may not be able to detect and correct errors before releasing our product commercially. We cannot assure you that undetected errors or performance problems in our existing or future products will not be discovered in the future or that known errors, considered minor by us, will not be considered serious by our customers, resulting in a decrease in our revenues.\nWe may be subject to lawsuits for information by our advertisers and our creators, which may affect our business.\nLaws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their advertisers or of social media content creators and for the content of their advertisers' listings are currently unsettled. It is unclear whether we could be subjected to claims for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories relating to the information we publish on our websites or the information that is published across our platforms. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services, as well as print publications in the past. We may not successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by our advertisers or our creators. Our potential liability for unlawful activities of our advertisers or our creators or for the content of our advertisers' listings could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability, which may require us, among other things, to spend substantial resources or to discontinue certain service offerings. Our insurance may not adequately protect us against these types of claims and the defense of such claims may divert the attention of our management from our operations. If we are subjected to such lawsuits, it may adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to detect click-fraud, we could lose the confidence of our advertisers and advertising partners as a result of lost revenue to advertisers or misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, thereby causing our business to suffer.\n\u201cClick-fraud\u201d is a form of online fraud when a person or computer program imitates a legitimate user by clicking on an advertisement for the purpose generating a charge per click without having an actual interest in the target of the advertisement's link. We are exposed to the risk of fraudulent or illegitimate clicks on our sponsored listings. The security measures we have in place, which are designed to reduce the likelihood of click-fraud, detect click-fraud from time to time. While the instances of click-fraud that we have detected to date have not had a material effect on our business, click-fraud could result in an advertiser experiencing a reduced return on their investment in our advertising programs because the fraudulent clicks will not lead to revenue for the advertisers. As a result, our advertisers and advertising partners may become dissatisfied with our advertising programs, which could lead to loss of advertisers, advertising partners and revenue. In addition, anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary and confidential information or could cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to address problems caused by such breaches. Concerns over the security\nof the Internet and other online transactions and the privacy of users may also deter people from using the Internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, it may result in costly litigation.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not claim our current or future products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Any such claims, with or without merit, could cause costly litigation that could consume significant management time. As the number of product and services offerings in our market increases and functionalities increasingly overlap, companies such as ours may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, such as the pending Blue Calypso lawsuit described above. These claims also might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements. If required, we may not be able to obtain such royalty or license agreements, or obtain them on terms acceptable to us.\nHistorically, we have not relied upon patents to protect our proprietary technology, and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services which would harm our competitive position.\nOur success depends upon our proprietary technology. We do not have registered patents on any of our current platforms, because we determined that the costs of patent prosecution outweighed the benefits given the alternative of reliance upon copyright law to protect our computer code and other proprietary technology and properties. In addition to copyright laws, we rely upon service mark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, or develop similar technology independently. In addition, effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. We cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products and services or design around any intellectual property rights we hold.\nWe have developed a new platform called the IZEA Exchange (IZEAx). IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation of multiple types of content including blog posts, status updates, videos and photos through a wide variety of social channels including blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and LinkedIn, among others. We have filed a patent application covering important features of this platform and have submitted a trademark application for \u201cNative Ad Exchange,\u201d which are currently pending approval. We are not aware of any reason why such applications will not be granted, although there can be no assurance thereof.\nOur market is subject to rapid technological change and, to compete, we must continually enhance our products and services.\nWe must continue to enhance and improve the performance, functionality and reliability of our products and services. The social sponsorship industry is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user requirements and preferences, frequent new product and services introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our products and services obsolete. In the past, we have discovered that some of our customers desire additional performance and functionality not currently offered by our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. The development of our technology and other proprietary technology involves significant technical and business risks. We may fail to use new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards. If we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions, customer requirements or emerging industry standards, we may not be able to increase our revenue and expand our business.\nDifficulties we may encounter managing our growth could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have experienced a period of growth that has placed, and and will continue to place, a strain on our managerial and financial resources. As our business needs expand, we intend to hire new employees. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will be required to:\n\u2022\nimprove existing, and implement new, operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\ninstall enhanced management information systems; and\n\u2022\ntrain, motivate and manage our employees.\nWe may not be able to install adequate management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner, and our current or planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business would be seriously harmed.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.\nWe believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management, including Edward H. Murphy, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ryan S. Schram, our Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Murphy, who is our founder, has unique knowledge regarding the social sponsorship space and business contacts that would be difficult to replace. Mr. Schram has sales, marketing and development expertise regarding our platforms that our other officers do not possess. If Messrs. Murphy and Schram were to become unavailable to us, our operations would be adversely affected. We maintain \"key-man\" life insurance for our benefit in the amount of $1,500,000 on the life of Mr. Murphy, but not for any other officer. This insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for the loss of Mr. Murphy. Moreover, we have no insurance to compensate us for the loss of any other of our executive officers or key employees.\nOur future success and our ability to expand our operations will also depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified graphic designers, computer scientists, sales and marketing and senior management personnel. Competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals and the high demand for them, particularly in the Orlando, Florida area where our headquarters are located. We have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel. Failure to attract, assimilate and retain personnel, including key management, technical, sales and marketing personnel, would have a material adverse effect on our business and potential growth.\nHaving only three executive officers and two independent directors limits our ability to establish effective independent corporate governance procedures and increases the control of our executive officers and non-independent directors.\nWe have only three executive officers and five directors. Two of our directors are also executive officers, one director is our largest individual stockholder and two directors are considered independent. Accordingly, it is difficult to establish effective operating board committees comprised of independent members to oversee committee functions. This structure gives our executive officers and largest stockholder significant control over all our corporate governance matters.\nUnless and until we have a larger board of directors that would include a majority of independent members, there will be limited oversight of our executive officers\u2019 decisions and activities and little ability for you to challenge or reverse those decisions and activities, even if they are not in your best interests.\nPublic company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, we expect these rules and regulations to increase our compliance costs and to make certain activities more time consuming and costly. As a public company, we also expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult and costly for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nExercise of stock options, warrants and other securities will dilute your percentage of ownership and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAs of March 12, 2015, we have 57,697,666 shares of common stock issued, outstanding stock options to purchase 12,977,378 shares of common stock at an average price of $0.44 per share, outstanding warrants to purchase 54,042,749 shares of common stock at an average price of $0.41 per share, and 1,754,164 shares of vested, yet unissued, shares of restricted common stock. Additionally, we have reserved shares to issue stock options, restricted stock or other awards to purchase or receive up to 7,107,638 shares of common stock under our May 2011 Equity Incentive Plan and 1,492,397 shares of common stock under our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In the future, we may grant additional stock options, warrants and\nconvertible securities. The exercise, conversion or exchange of stock options, warrants or convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our other stockholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to fall and could impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional securities.\nThere may be substantial issuances of our common stock to satisfy our obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement for our acquisition of Ebyline, Inc.\nOn January 30, 2015, we purchased of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Ebyline pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2015, by and among IZEA, Ebyline and the stockholders of Ebyline. The aggregate consideration payable by us will be an amount in the aggregate of up to $8,850,000, including a cash payment made at closing of $1,200,000, a stock issuance six months after the closing valued at $250,000, up to an additional $1,900,000 in two equal installments of $950,000 on the first and second anniversaries of the closing (subject to reduction) and up to $5,500,000 in performance payments paid over three years based on Ebyline meeting certain revenue targets for each of the three years ending December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Both the $1,900,000 in annual payments and the $5,500,000 in performance payments may be made in cash or common stock, at our option.\nIf Ebyline achieves all of the revenue targets, we do not have enough cash reserves to pay for the complete purchase price in cash. As such, we may issue shares of our common stock to satisfy the future payment obligations or raise funds through additional financing opportunities. Stock payments are to be based on the 30-day volume-weighted average closing price prior to the payment date. Additional financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, obtaining credit facilities or other financing alternatives. The issuance of a substantial number of shares of common stock to raise additional capital to satisfy the future payment obligations could significantly dilute the percentage ownership interests of and may be at prices more beneficial than those paid by our existing common stockholders.\nThere may be substantial sales of our common stock under the prospectus relating to our 2014 Private Placement, which could cause our stock price to drop.\nWe agreed with the investors in our 2014 Private Placement to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC with respect to the resale of all of the shares of our common stock, as well as shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants, purchased by investors. We filed a registration statement on Form S-1 on April 7, 2014 and it was declared effective on May 14, 2014. The registration statement included a total of 68,571,456 shares of our common stock (of which 34,285,728 shares are presently outstanding and 34,285,728 shares are issuable upon the exercise of warrants). There are currently no agreements or understandings in place with these selling stockholders to restrict their sale of those shares. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders over a short period of time could cause the market price of our common stock to drop and could impair our ability to raise capital in the future by selling additional securities.\nHolders of warrants issued in our 2014 Private Placement have anti-dilution adjustment rights that, if triggered, could dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders.\nHolders of our warrants to purchase 17,893,375 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.35 per share and warrants to purchase 17,893,375 shares at an exercise price of $0.50 per share issued in our 2014 Private Placement have anti-dilution adjustment rights that, if triggered, could dilute the interests of our common stockholders. The warrants contain weighted average anti-dilution protection for warrant holders if we sell another equity or equity-linked security at a price per share lower than the respective exercise prices during the five-year term of the warrants. Additionally, the warrants do not contain a negotiated floor for the exercise price. As compared with a full ratchet anti-dilution provision, which resets the exercise price at the lowest price in any subsequent sale of stock, a weighted average anti-dilution provision takes into account both the lower price and the number of shares issued at the lower price. The triggering of these anti-dilution provisions could result in the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants, which would dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders.\nOur earnings are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns.\nOur revenues and earnings may fluctuate significantly in the future. General economic or other political conditions may cause a downturn in the market for our products or services. Despite the recent improvements in market conditions, a future downturn in the market for our products or services could adversely affect our operating results and increase the risk of substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations in our earnings. Our future operating results may be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated advertisers and creators; our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and services on a timely basis; changes in the mix of products developed, produced and\nsold; and disputes with our advertisers and creators. These factors affecting our future earnings are difficult to forecast and could harm our quarterly and/or annual operating results. The change in our earnings or general economic conditions may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology-based companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in our industry;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nlimited \"public float\" in the hands of a small number of persons who sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market prices of our common stock;\n\u2022\nexpiration of any Rule 144 holding periods or registration of unregistered securities issued by us;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u2022\noperating results that fall below expectations;\n\u2022\nloss of any strategic relationship;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments; and\n\u2022\neconomic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nThere may be a limited public market for our securities; we presently fail to qualify for listing on any national securities exchanges.\nOur common stock currently does not meet all of the requirements for initial listing on a national securities exchange. Specifically, the bid price of our common stock is less than the minimum bid price required to obtain a listing. Trading in our common stock continues to be conducted in the over-the-counter market. As a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock, and our common stock may be less attractive for margin loans, for investment by larger financial institutions, as consideration in possible future acquisition transactions or other purposes.\nOur common stock is currently deemed a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which makes it more difficult for our investors to sell their shares.\nOur common stock is subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules adopted under Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules generally apply to companies whose common stock is not listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or other national securities exchange and trades at less than $4.00 per share, other than companies that have had average revenue of at least $6,000,000 for the last three years or that have tangible net worth of at least $5,000,000 ($2,000,000 if the company has been operating for three or more years). These rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stock to persons other than \u201cestablished customers\u201d complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market,\nif any, for our securities. If our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of our securities.\nInvestor relations activities and supply and demand factors may affect the price of our common stock.\nWe expect to utilize various techniques such as non-deal road shows and investor relations campaigns in order to create investor awareness for our business. These campaigns may include personal, video and telephone conferences with investors and prospective investors in which our business practices are described. We may provide compensation to investor relations firms and pay for newsletters, websites, mailings and email campaigns that are produced by third-parties based upon publicly-available information concerning us. We do not intend to review or approve the content of such analysts\u2019 reports or other materials based upon analysts\u2019 own research or methods. Investor relations firms should generally disclose when they are compensated for their efforts, but whether such disclosure is made or complete is not under our control. Our investors may be willing, from time to time, to encourage investor awareness through similar activities. Investor awareness activities may also be suspended or discontinued which may impact the trading market of our common stock.\nThe SEC and FINRA enforce various statutes and regulations intended to prevent manipulative or deceptive devices in connection with the purchase or sale of any security and carefully scrutinize trading patterns and company news and other communications for false or misleading information, particularly in cases where the hallmarks of \u201cpump and dump\u201d activities may exist, such as rapid share price increases or decreases. We and our shareholders may be subjected to enhanced regulatory scrutiny due to the limited trading markets in which our shares may be offered or sold which have been associated with improper activities concerning penny stocks, such as the OTCQB marketplace.\nThe Supreme Court has stated that manipulative action is a term of art connoting intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities. Often times, manipulation is associated by regulators with forces that upset the supply and demand factors that would normally determine trading prices. Securities regulators have often cited thinly-traded markets, small numbers of holders, and awareness campaigns as components of their claims of price manipulation and other violations of law when combined with manipulative trading, such as wash sales, matched orders or other manipulative trading timed to coincide with false or touting press releases. There can be no assurance that our third-parties\u2019 activities or determinations by purchasers or holders as to when or under what circumstances or at what prices they may be willing to buy or sell stock, will not artificially impact (or would be claimed by regulators to have affected) the normal supply and demand factors that determine the price of stock.\nWe have not registered our securities under the Securities Exchange Act and therefore are not subject to the SEC's beneficial ownership reporting and proxy statement rules.\nWe do not currently have a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would subject us to the proxy solicitation rules and the beneficial ownership reporting rules for executive officers and directors. We are, however, subject to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act because we have a current registration statement in 2015. This means that we are required to file Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K with the SEC, but we are still not subject to the beneficial ownership reporting and proxy statement rules, which would provide our stockholders and potential investors with additional information about our company and management. So long as we are subject to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, shareholders holding restricted shares of our common stock may utilize Rule 144 is six-month holding period prior to sale. Should we no longer have a current registration statement in 2016, we will no longer be subject to Section 15(d) and will be a \"voluntary filer\" so that shareholders holding restricted shares of our common stock will be required to hold our shares for 12 months prior to sale. When we are able to satisfy initial eligibility criteria to \"uplist\" our common stock to a national securities exchange such as Nasdaq, we would expect to register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act and then become subject to all applicable reporting rules.", "PERMNO": 15943, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "IZEA"}
