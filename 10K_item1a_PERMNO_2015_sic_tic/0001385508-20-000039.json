{"cik": "1385508", "company": "OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-04", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Prior to making a decision about investing in our securities, you should carefully consider all of the information in this Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations. The occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Business, Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have historically generated limited revenue to date and expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have an accumulated deficit of $62.8 million. The likelihood of our future success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays often encountered in connection with the clinical trials that will be conducted and on the development of new solutions to common addictions and related disorders. These potential challenges include, but are not limited to, unanticipated clinical trial delays, poor data, changes in the regulatory and competitive landscape and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current budget estimates. In order to complete certain clinical trials and otherwise operate pursuant to our current business strategy, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses. In addition, we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and we also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund the operating losses and capital expenditures. We recognize that if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues or source funding, we will not be able to continue operations as currently contemplated, complete planned clinical trials and/or achieve profitability. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability will also negatively impact the value of our securities. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, then the Company will most likely fail.\nThe approval and launch of a generic version of NARCAN\u00ae or other naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray products that\ncompete with NARCAN\u00ae would adversely affect sales of NARCAN\u00ae.\nAlthough NARCAN\u00ae (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray (\u201cNARCAN\u00ae\u201d) is protected by patents covering its\nmanufacture, formulation, distribution system and method of use, multiple third parties have filed ANDAs seeking FDA\napproval of generic versions of NARCAN\u00ae. Notwithstanding our patents, it is possible that once its application is approved,\nan ANDA filer could introduce a competing naloxone hydrochloride product before our patents expire if it is determined that it\ndoes not infringe our patents, or that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, or if such company or companies decide, before\napplicable ongoing patent litigation is concluded, to launch a naloxone hydrochloride product at risk of being held liable for\ndamages for patent infringement. As discussed below, the FDA has approved the first ANDA for NARCAN\u00ae.\nTwo separate companies, (i) Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiary Teva\nPharamceuticals USA, Inc. (collectively \u201cTeva\u201d), and (ii) Perrigo UK FINCO Limited Partnership sent us and our partner\nAdapt Pharma Operations Limited (\u201cAdapt\u201d), notices that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market a\ngeneric version of NARCAN\u00ae, and we, along with Adapt, filed patent lawsuits against each of these companies in the District\nCourt for New Jersey. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this or the other ANDA litigation proceedings against the\nANDA filers. For more information about these litigation matters, see Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings.\nOn April 19, 2019, the FDA announced approval of Teva\u2019s ANDA for a generic version of NARCAN\u00ae. The timing\nof any potential commercial launch of a generic version of NARCAN\u00ae is uncertain. However, after any introduction of a\ngeneric competitor, a significant percentage of the prescriptions written for NARCAN\u00ae may be filled with the generic version,\nresulting in a loss in sales of NARCAN\u00ae. Generic competition often also results in decreases in the prices at which branded\nproducts can be sold, particularly when there is more than one generic available in the marketplace. In addition, certain U.S.\nstate laws allow for, and in some instances in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician mandate, the\ndispensing of generic products rather than branded products where a generic version is available. We cannot predict whether\nwe will be able to maintain the validity of any of our patents or will otherwise obtain a judicial determination that a generic\nnaloxone hydrochloride product infringes any of our patents. However, we expect that the launch of a generic version of\nNARCAN\u00ae, or the approval and launch of other products that compete with NARCAN\u00ae, would have a material adverse\neffect on our licensing partner\u2019s sales of NARCAN\u00ae and as a result have a material adverse effect on the royalties that we\nwould receive from such sales of NARCAN\u00ae, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe may not succeed in completing the development of our product candidates, commercializing our products, and generating significant revenues.\nOur current pipeline includes medicines in development for OOR, AUD, OUD, ACO and additional treatment applications. Our products have generated limited revenues. Our ability to generate significant revenues and achieve profitability depends on our ability to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, obtain market approval, successfully launch our products and generate significant revenues. On December 15, 2014, we and Adapt entered into the Adapt Agreement, as amended by the Adapt Amendment entered into between the parties on December 13, 2016, that provides Adapt, now a subsidiary of EBS, with a global license to develop and commercialize our intranasal naloxone Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, now known as NARCAN\u00ae. The loss for any reason of Adapt/EBS as a key partner could have a significant and adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to retain Adapt/EBS as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize NARCAN\u00ae as planned and we may experience delays in or suspension of the marketing of NARCAN\u00ae.\nThe future success of our business cannot be determined at this time, and we do not anticipate generating significant revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we expect to generate revenues from NARCAN\u00ae, for which we are dependent on many factors, including the performance of our licensing partner Adapt/EBS and competition in the market. In addition, we have no experience in commercializing on our own and face a number of challenges with respect to commercialization efforts, including, among other challenges:\n\u2022\nhaving inadequate financial or other resources to complete the development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe inability to manufacture our products in commercial quantities, at an adequate quality, at an acceptable cost or in collaboration with third parties;\n\u2022\nexperiencing delays or unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing or manufacturing;\n\u2022\nthe inability to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution channels;\n\u2022\nhealthcare professionals and patients may not accept our treatments;\n\u2022\nwe may not be aware of possible complications from the continued use of our products since we have limited clinical experience with respect to the actual use of our products;\n\u2022\ntechnological breakthroughs in reversing opioid overdoses and treating patients with AUD, OUD and ACO may reduce the demand for our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market for reversing opioid overdoses and treating patients with AUD, OUD and ACO, new alliances between existing market participants and the entrance of new market participants may interfere with our market penetration efforts;\n\u2022\nthird-party payors may not agree to reimburse patients for any or all of the purchase price of our products, which may adversely affect patients\u2019 willingness to purchase our products;\n\u2022\nuncertainty as to market demand may result in inefficient pricing of our products;\n\u2022\nwe may face third party claims of intellectual property infringement;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products in our markets or may face adverse regulatory or legal actions relating to our products even if regulatory approval is obtained; and\n\u2022\nwe our dependent upon the results of clinical studies relating to our products and the products of our competitors. If data from a clinical trial is unfavorable, we would be reluctant to advance the specific product for the indication for which it was being developed.\nIf we are unable to meet any one or more of these challenges successfully, our ability to effectively commercialize our products could be limited, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGiven our lack of sufficient revenue and cash flow, we may need to raise additional capital, which may be unavailable to us or, even if consummated, may cause dilution or place significant restrictions on our ability to operate.\nSince we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or cash flow to fund our operations for the foreseeable future, we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to maintain or expand our operations. We may also need additional funding to continue the development of our product candidates, build our sales and marketing capabilities, promote brand identity or develop or acquire complementary technologies, assets and companies, as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes.\nOther than the Open Market Sale AgreementSM dated November 14, 2019, we do not currently have any arrangements or credit facilities in place as a source of funds, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital if needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of our product candidates and other business opportunities\nand our ability to achieve our business objectives, our competitiveness and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to fund our business could thus lead to the loss of your investment.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities and/or equity-linked securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may also issue equity securities and/or equity-linked securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of Common Stock. Given our need for cash and that equity and equity-linked issuances are very common types of fundraising for companies like us, the risk of dilution is particularly significant for our stockholders.\nDebt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on our assets and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt. Debt financing could also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our products or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe depend on third parties in connection with our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, which may result in costs and delays that prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or successfully commercializing our product candidates.\nWe engage third parties to perform various aspects of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. For instance, on September 10, 2018, we entered into a development and manufacturing agreement for OPNT003 (intranasal nalmefene), a potent, long-acting opioid antagonist for the treatment of opioid overdose with Consort Medical plc (\"Consort\"), a leading contract development and manufacturing organization. Under this agreement, Aesica and Bespak, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Consort, will work with us to produce a pre-filled delivery nasal spray with nalmefene. As part of the agreement, Aesica will supply Opiant with clinical samples and registration batches for the purposes of performing clinical studies and obtaining regulatory approvals. We depend on these third parties to perform these activities on a timely basis in accordance with the protocol, good laboratory practices, good clinical practices, and other regulatory requirements. Our reliance on these third parties for pre-clinical and clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Accordingly, if these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed, terminated or our data may be rejected by the FDA. For example, if Consort were to cease to be able to supply the device to us, our OPNT003 program would be delayed until we obtained an alternative source, which could take a considerable length of time. If there are delays in testing or obtaining regulatory approvals as a result of a third party\u2019s failure to perform, our drug discovery and development costs will likely increase, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nFurther, upon approval by the FDA, Aesica and Bespak will manufacture and supply the commercial device for us. Third parties\u2019 abilities to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our product candidates is dependent on the operation of their facilities which may be impacted by, among other things:\n\u2022\navailability, performance, or contamination of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier;\n\u2022\ncapacity of our facility and those of contract manufacturer;\n\u2022\nthe performance of information technology systems;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ninclement weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nchanges in forecasts of future demand for product components;\n\u2022\ntiming and actual number of production runs for product components;\n\u2022\npotential facility contamination by microorganisms or viruses;\n\u2022\nupdating of manufacturing specifications; and\n\u2022\nproduct quality success rates and yields.\nIf the efficient manufacture and supply of our product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments or supply constraints, which may materially impact our ongoing and future pre-clinical studies and clinical trials.\nAny contract manufacturer must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA approval process, as well as other regulatory approval processes, and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It is a multi-year process to build and license a new manufacturing facility and it can take significant time to qualify and license a contract manufacturer.\nIf regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturer or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and, potentially, in the future, foreign\nregulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, and supply constraints for our products.\nOur current and future operations substantially depend on our Chief Executive Officer and our ability to hire other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nOur business depends and will continue to depend in substantial part on the continued service of Dr. Roger Crystal, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Dr. Crystal would significantly impede implementation and execution of our business strategy and may result in the failure to reach our goals.\nOur future viability and ability to achieve sales and profits will also depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing operations. There is a risk that we will be unable to attract, train, retain or motivate qualified personnel, both near term or in the future, and the failure to do so may severely damage its prospects.\nOur employment agreements with our executive officers may require us to pay severance benefits to any of those persons who are terminated in connection with a change in control of us which could harm our financial condition or results.\nCertain of our executive officers are parties to employment agreements that contain change in control and severance provisions providing for aggregate cash payments of up to approximately $5.1 million for severance and other benefits and acceleration of vesting of stock options with a value of approximately $3.2 million, in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change of control of the Company. The accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock units could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and harm the market price of our Common Stock. The payment of these severance benefits could harm our financial conditions and results. In addition, these potential severance payments may discourage or prevent third parties from seeking a business combination with us.\nUnder the Company's agreement with Adapt/EBS, they have the right to license third-party intellectual property which may result in a reduction of our potential royalty and milestone payments.\nUnder the Company's license agreement, with Adapt/EBS (the \"Adapt Agreement\"), Adapt/EBS may seek to license certain intellectual property held by a third-party that Adapt/EBS reasonably determines would be infringed upon through the performance of the Adapt Agreement or that Adapt/EBS otherwise determines is necessary or desirable for Adapt/EBS to perform its obligations under the Adapt Agreement. On March 18, 2019, the Company and Adapt/EBS entered into an amendment to the Adapt Agreement that clarifies the circumstances under which Adapt/EBS may enter into such licenses and deduct a material amount, as provided in the Adapt Agreement, of any upfront payment, milestones or royalties paid to such third-party from any regulatory milestone payments, sales-based milestone payments, and royalty payments payable to the Company under the Adapt Agreement. Following the execution of the amendment, in most situations, in order to exercise its right to deduct any payments with respect thereto, Adapt/EBS will need the consent of the Company that the licensing arrangement is acceptable.\nSome of our programs are partially supported by government grant awards, which may not be available to us in the future.\nWe have received funding under grant award programs funded by governmental agencies, such as the NIDA and BARDA. To fund a portion of our future research and development programs, we may apply for additional grant funding from these or similar governmental agencies. However, funding by these governmental agencies may be significantly reduced or eliminated in the future for a number of reasons. For example, some programs are subject to a yearly appropriations process in Congress. In addition, we may not receive full funding under current or future grants because of budgeting constraints of the agency administering the program or unsatisfactory progress on the study being funded. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will receive any future grant funding from any government agencies, or, that if received, we will receive the full amount of the particular grant award. Any such reductions could delay the development of our product candidates and the introduction of new products.\nExposure to United Kingdom political developments, including the outcome of its withdrawal from membership in the European Union, could be costly and difficult to comply with and could seriously harm our business.\nWe have based a significant portion of our non-U.S. operations in the United Kingdom. In June 2016, a referendum was held in the U.K. which resulted in a majority voting in favor of the U.K. withdrawing from the E.U. (commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"). Pursuant to legislation approved by the U.K. Parliament and the E.U. Parliament in January 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the E.U. with effect from 11 p.m. (GMT) on January 31, 2020 on the terms of a withdrawal agreement agreed between the U.K. and the E.U. in October 2019 (the \"Withdrawal Agreement\"). The Withdrawal Agreement provides that the U.K.'s withdrawal is followed by a \"transition period\", during which, in summary, the U.K. is not a member of the E.U. but most E.U. rules and regulations continue to apply to the U.K. During the transition period, the U.K. and the E.U. will seek to negotiate the terms of a long-term trading relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. based on a \"Political Declaration\" agreed between the U.K. and the E.U. in October 2019. The transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement will expire on December 31, 2020 (unless both the U.K. and the E.U. agree to extend the period of transition by one or two years). The political negotiation surrounding the terms of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the E.U. has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U., including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply. This is because, once the \"transition period\" expires then, subject to the terms of any long-term trading relationship agreed between the U.K. and the E.U., the U.K. will determine which E.U.-derived laws to replace or replicate. If no long-term trading relationship is agreed between the U.K. and the E.U. by the end of the transition period provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement, the U.K.'s membership of the E.U. could ultimately terminate under a so-called \"hard Brexit.\" The full effect of Brexit is uncertain and depends on any agreements the U.K. may make to retain access to E.U. markets. Consequently, no assurance can be given about the impact of the outcome and our business, including operational and tax policies, may be seriously harmed or require reassessment if our European operations or presence become a significant part of our business.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and product candidates that are similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our products and product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our products and product candidates that are important to our business, as appropriate. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued or granted with respect to applications that are currently pending or that we may apply for in the future with respect to one or more of our products and product candidates, or that issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid and/or unenforceable.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Although we may enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, distribution partners, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued, and even if issued, the patents may not meaningfully protect our products or product candidates, effectively prevent competitors and third parties from commercializing competitive products or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative products in a non-infringing manner.\nChanges in either the patent laws, implementing regulations or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may also diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe cannot be certain that our patents and patent rights will be effective in protecting our products, product candidates and technologies. Failure to protect such assets may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may face litigation from third parties claiming that our products or business infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights, or seeking to challenge the validity of our patents.\nOur future success is also dependent in part on the strength of our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how, which have been developed from years of research and development, and on our ability, and the ability of our future collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates, if approved, and use our proprietary technologies without alleged or actual infringement, misappropriation or other violation of the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn addition to the litigation with TEVA and Perrigo discussed below, we may be exposed to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or additional future litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current and any future product candidates and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings, post grant review and inter partes review before the USPTO or similar adversarial proceedings or litigation in other jurisdictions seeking to challenge the validity of our intellectual property rights, claiming that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others, or claiming that our technologies, products or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nThere have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. We actively track third-party applications with claims that, if valid, could be construed to read upon the use our NARCAN\u00ae product(s) for the treatment of opioid overdose, or other products and indications. Certain of these applications could be granted in the future. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future including, perhaps, the aforementioned allowed patent application, regardless of their merit. There is a risk that third parties may choose to engage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patent rights against us. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, and the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our compositions, formulations, or methods of treatment, prevention or use, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. Some claimants may have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or to enable the commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In such an event, we would be unable to further practice our technologies or develop and commercialize any of our product candidates at issue, which could harm our business significantly.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, if approved. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and employee time and resources from our business. Third parties making such claims may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to these legal actions than we or our licensors or collaborators can. In the event of a successful claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nSimilarly, we or our licensors or collaborators may initiate such proceedings or litigation against third parties, e.g., to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights controlled by third parties. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one\nrequiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such United States patent claim, there is no assurance that a court would invalidate the claims of any such United States patent.\nPatent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. During the course of any patent or other intellectual property litigation or other proceeding, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our product candidates or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, ability to compete in the marketplace, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property, or those of our licensors. To counter infringement, misappropriation, unauthorized use or other violations, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel.\nFor example, within the last 24 months, we along with Adapt (collectively, the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) have filed six separate complaints for patent infringement against Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (\u201cTeva Ltd.\u201d) and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Ltd. (\u201cTeva USA\u201d and, together with Teva Ltd., \u201cTeva\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey arising from Teva USA\u2019s filing of ANDA with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN before the expiration of the Company\u2019s patents. Additionally, on October 25, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a similar complaint for patent infringement against Perrigo UK FINCO Limited Partnership (\u201cPerrigo\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey arising from Perrigo\u2019s ANDA filing with the FDA.\nFor more information about these litigation matters, see Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings. We maintain full confidence in our intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN\u00ae and expect that the Company\u2019s patents will continue to be vigorously defended from any infringement. However, there can be no assurances that we will be successful with respect to these litigation matters or any other litigation matters which may arise in the ordinary course of our business. Such a failure may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nWe may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensees or any future licensors, infringement, misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nIn any infringement, misappropriation or other intellectual property litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could negatively impact our business.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents covering NARCAN\u00ae, and any future product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Further, licensing partners may not prosecute patents in certain jurisdictions in which we may obtain commercial rights, thereby precluding the possibility of later obtaining patent protection in these countries. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets.\nAdditionally, the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. For example, unlike other countries, China has a heightened requirement for patentability, and specifically requires a detailed description of medical uses of a claimed drug. In India, unlike the United States, there is no link between regulatory approval of a drug and its patent status. Furthermore, generic or biosimilar drug manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our licensors\u2019 patents, requiring us or our licensees or any future licensors to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. In addition, certain countries in Europe and developing countries, including China and India, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensees or any future licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensees or any future licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our and our licensees\u2019 or any future licensors\u2019 efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants, contractors or advisors have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property of a third party, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the intellectual property and other proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed such intellectual property or other proprietary information. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. To the extent that we fail to obtain such assignments, such assignments do not contain a self-executing assignment of intellectual property rights or such assignments are breached, we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they\nmay bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and scientific personnel.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, in seeking to develop and maintain a competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, consultants, independent contractors, advisors, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, suppliers and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with employees and certain consultants. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective.\nSince our inception, we have sought to contract with manufacturers to supply commercial quantities of pharmaceutical formulations and products. As a result, we have disclosed, under confidentiality agreements, various aspects of our technology with potential manufacturers and suppliers. We believe that these disclosures, while necessary for our business, may have resulted and may result in the attempt by potential manufacturers and suppliers to improperly assert ownership claims to our technology in an attempt to gain an advantage in negotiating manufacturing and supplier rights.\nWe cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts both within and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Further, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such third party, or those to whom they communicate such technology or information, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nTrade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect as trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles, and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from company to company or academic to industry scientific positions. If we fail to prevent material disclosure of the know-how, trade secrets and other intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are able to adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, our trade secrets could otherwise become known or could be independently discovered by our competitors. For\nexample, competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, in the absence of patent protection, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate, from using that technology or information to compete with us.\nWe may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our business.\nOnce granted, patents may remain open to opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such grant. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims thus attacked, or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether. In addition, the degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because even granted intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make formulations that are similar to our NARCAN\u00ae or other formulations but that are not covered by the claims of our patent rights\u037e\n\u2022\nthe patents of third parties may have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or any future strategic partners might not have been the first to conceive or reduce to practice the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or any future strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions\u037e\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights\u037e\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents\u037e\n\u2022\nissued patents that we may own or that we exclusively license in the future may not provide us with any competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors\u037e\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets\u037e\n\u2022\nthird parties performing manufacturing or testing for us using our product candidates or technologies could use the intellectual property of others without obtaining a proper license;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe expiration or loss of patent protection may adversely affect our future revenues and operating earnings.\nWe rely on patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of our products and product candidates. In particular, patent protection is important in the development and eventual commercialization of our products and product candidates. Patents covering our products and product candidates normally provide market exclusivity, which is important in order for our products and product candidates to become profitable.\nCertain of our patents will expire in the next 15 years. While we are seeking additional patent coverage which may protect the technology underlying these patents, there can be no assurances that such additional patent protection will be granted, or if granted, that these patents will not be infringed upon or otherwise held enforceable. Even if we are successful in obtaining a patent, patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., the natural expiration of a utility patent typically is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection, our products and product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such methods and devices\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval, Manufacturing and Commercialization\nDelays in the completion of, or the termination of, any clinical for any drug candidates could adversely affect our business.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time consuming, unpredictable and difficult to design and implement. The results of clinical trials may be unfavorable, they may continue for several years, and they may take significantly longer to complete and involve significantly more costs than expected. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could significantly affect product development costs and plans with respect to any of our drug candidates. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed and experience difficulties for a number of reasons, including delays and difficulties caused by circumstances over which we may have no control. For instance, approvals of the scope, design or trial site may not be obtained from the FDA and other required bodies in a timely manner or at all, agreements with acceptable terms may not be reached in a timely manner or at all with contract research organizations (\"CROs\"), to conduct the trials, a sufficient number of subjects may not be recruited and enrolled in the trials, and third-party manufacturers of the materials for use in the trials may encounter delays and problems in the manufacturing process, including failure to produce materials in sufficient quantities or of an acceptable quality to complete the trials.\nIn January 2020, we were notified by the FDA that it was placing the PK study for OPNT003 on clinical hold and the FDA requested additional information in regards to the drug delivery device that we intend to use in this clinical trial. We currently expect to submit the requested data to the FDA and resume the clinical study in the first quarter of 2020. However, if we are unable to satisfactorily address the FDA\u2019s requests or we were to experience delays in the commencement or completion of, or if we were to terminate, any clinical or non-clinical trials we pursue in the future, the commercial prospects for the applicable drug candidates may be limited or eliminated, which may prevent us from recouping our investment in research and development efforts for the drug candidate and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf we are not able to obtain any required regulatory approvals for our drug candidates, we will not be able to commercialize our drug candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be limited.\nOur current pipeline includes medicines in development for OOR, AUD, OUD, ACO and additional treatment applications. Our products have generated limited revenues. We must successfully complete clinical trials for our drug candidates before we can apply for marketing approval. Even if we complete our clinical trials, it does not assure marketing approval. Our clinical trials may be unsuccessful, which would materially harm our business. Even if our initial clinical trials are successful, we are required to conduct additional clinical trials to establish our drug candidates\u2019 safety and efficacy, before an NDA or Biologics License Application (\"BLA\"), or their foreign equivalents can be filed with the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval of our drug candidates.\nClinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Success in early phases of pre-clinical and clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our drug candidates. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, export, import and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our drug in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries. In the United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of clinical trials of each drug to establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical development to ensure its quality before an NDA is approved. Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions impose similar requirements. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are eventually approved for commercialization. If our development efforts for our drug candidates, including regulatory approval, are not successful for their planned indications, or if adequate demand for our drug candidates is not generated, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on the receipt of regulatory approval and the issuance of such regulatory approvals is uncertain and subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe results of toxicology studies may not support the filing of an IND for our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or Institutional Review Boards, or \"IRB\", may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of our drug candidates\u2019 safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials may not be satisfactory or may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe dosing of our drug candidates in a particular clinical trial may not be at an optimal level;\n\u2022\npatients in our clinical trials may suffer adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to our drug candidates;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates for the foregoing, or any other reasons, will prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. We cannot guarantee that regulators will agree with our assessment of the results of the clinical trials we intend to conduct in the future or that such trials will be successful. The FDA and other regulators have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional clinical trials, or pre-clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of our drug candidates.\nExcluding any activities related to NARCAN\u00ae, we have not submitted an NDA or received regulatory approval to market our drug candidates in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on consultants and third party CROs, with expertise in this area to assist us in this process. Securing regulatory approvals to market a product requires the submission of pre-clinical, clinical, and/or pharmacokinetic data, information about product manufacturing processes and inspection of facilities and supporting information to the appropriate regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish a drug candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy for each indication. Our drug candidates may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude us from obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use with respect to one or all intended indications.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidates involved, the jurisdiction in which regulatory approval is sought and the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory approval obtained in one jurisdiction does not necessarily mean that a drug candidate will receive regulatory approval in all jurisdictions in which we may seek approval, but the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to seek approval in a different jurisdiction. Failure to obtain regulatory marketing approval for our drug candidates in any indication will prevent us from commercializing the drug candidate, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nIf we fail to successfully commercialize any of our drug candidates, we may need to acquire additional drug candidates and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe have never directly commercialized any drug candidates and do not have any other compounds in pre-clinical testing, lead optimization or lead identification stages beyond our current drug candidates. We cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be sufficiently effective and safe to meet applicable regulatory standards for any indication. If we fail to successfully commercialize any of our drug candidates for their targeted indications, whether as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other therapeutic agents, our business would be adversely affected.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the product and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, may be limited.\nIf approved for marketing, the commercial success of our drug candidates will depend upon each product\u2019s acceptance by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance for any of our drug candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience, dosing burden and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of physicians to prescribe our drug candidates, and the target patient population to try new therapies;\n\u2022\nefficacy of our drug candidates compared to competing products;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of any new products that may in the future become available targeting indications for which our drug candidates may be approved;\n\u2022\nnew procedures or therapies that may reduce the incidences of any of the indications in which our drug candidates may show utility;\n\u2022\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\nthe inclusion or omission of our drug candidates in applicable therapeutic and vaccine guidelines;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our own or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in approved labeling from regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors or to receive the necessary pricing approvals from government bodies regulating the pricing and usage of therapeutics; and\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or reimbursement or government pricing approvals.\nIf any of our drug candidates are approved, but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our drug candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIn addition, even if we obtain regulatory approvals, the timing or scope of any approvals may prohibit or reduce our ability to commercialize our drug candidates successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render our drug candidates not commercially viable. For example, regulatory authorities may approve any of our drug candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for any of our drug candidates, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve any of our drug candidates with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that indication. Further, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may place conditions on approvals or require risk management plans or a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, (\"REMS\"), to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA may also require a REMS for an approved product when new safety information emerges. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of our drug candidates. Moreover, product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial success of our drug candidates.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for any of our drug candidates, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our drug candidates could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our drug candidates.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates for an indication, the FDA or foreign equivalent may still impose significant restrictions on their indicated uses or marketing or the conditions of approval, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time-consuming post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and post-market surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy. Our drug candidates will also be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of adverse events and other post-market information. These requirements include registration with the FDA, as well as continued compliance with current Good Clinical Practices regulations (\"cGCPs\"), for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current cGMP, requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents.\nThe FDA has the authority to require a REMS as part of an NDA or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers\nthat have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria or requiring patient testing, monitoring and/or enrollment in a registry.\nWith respect to sales and marketing activities by us or any future partner, advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other applicable federal, state and local laws in the United States and similar legal requirements in other countries. In the United States, the distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Application holders must obtain FDA approval for product and manufacturing changes, depending on the nature of the change. We may also be subject, directly or indirectly through our customers and partners, to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state laws, which impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs. If we participate in the U.S. Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the Federal Supply Schedule of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or other government drug programs, we will be subject to complex laws and regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations. All of these activities are also potentially subject to U.S. federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Similar requirements exist in many of these areas in other countries.\nIn addition, if any of our drug candidates are approved for a particular indication, our product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for our drug candidates, physicians may nevertheless legally prescribe our products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability and government fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nIf we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to the following administrative or judicial sanctions:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022\nissuance of warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nclinical holds;\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022\nsuspension or imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of product.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our drug candidates and generate revenue. Adverse regulatory action, whether pre- or post-approval, can also potentially lead to product liability claims and increase our product liability exposure.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our drug candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our drug candidates in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our drug candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a drug candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the drug candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, as clinical studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a drug candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/ or to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our drug candidates will be harmed.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our drug candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our drug candidates. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act, or (\"MMA\"), changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our drug candidates and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nThe Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The ACA revised the definition of \"average manufacturer price\" for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products.\nThe ACA remains subject to legislative efforts to repeal, modify or delay the implementation of the law. Efforts to date have generally been unsuccessful. If the ACA is repealed or modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law are delayed, such repeal, modification or delay may materially adversely impact our business, strategies, prospects, operating results or financial condition. We are unable to predict the full impact of any repeal or modification in the implementation of the ACA on us at this time.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce or eliminate our profitability.\nOur drug candidates may face competition sooner than expected.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our certain of our drug candidates and technologies and to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights. We must also operate without infringing upon patents and proprietary rights of others, including by obtaining appropriate licenses to patents or other proprietary rights held by third parties, if necessary. However, the applications we have filed or may file in the future may never yield patents that protect our inventions and intellectual property assets. Failure to obtain patents that sufficiently cover our formulations and technologies would limit our protection against compounding pharmacies, outsourcing facilities, generic drug manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and other parties who may seek to copy our products, produce products substantially similar to ours or use technologies substantially similar to those we own.\nWhile the FDA has confirmed a 505(b)(2) pathway for OPNT 003, we also intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for our other drug candidates provided under the FDCA, and similar laws in other countries. The FDCA provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Even if our drug candidates are considered to be reference products eligible for three years of exclusivity under the FDCA, another company could market competing products if the FDA approves a full NDA for such product containing the sponsor\u2019s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the products. Moreover, an amendment or repeal of the FDCA could result in a shorter exclusivity period for our drug candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we market any of our drug candidates in a manner that violates healthcare fraud and abuse laws, or if we violate government price reporting laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA enforces laws and regulations which require that the promotion of pharmaceutical products be consistent with the approved prescribing information. While physicians may prescribe an approved product for a so-called \"off label\" use, it is unlawful for a pharmaceutical company to promote its products in a manner that is inconsistent with its approved label and any company which engages in such conduct can subject that company to significant liability. Similarly, industry codes in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions prohibit companies from engaging in off-label promotion and regulatory agencies in various countries enforce violations of the code with civil penalties. While we intend to ensure that our promotional materials are consistent with our label, regulatory agencies may disagree with our assessment and may issue untitled letters, warning letters or may institute other civil or criminal enforcement proceedings. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act and similar state laws. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.\nThe U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not, in all cases, meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal health care fraud statutes; a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the U.S. False Claims Act. Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid.\nOver the past few years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicare or Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and the U.S. False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include substantial civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs, substantial criminal fines and imprisonment.\nWe will be completely dependent on third parties to manufacture our drug candidates, and our commercialization of our drug candidates could be halted, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain manufacturing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of our drug candidates or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the capability or infrastructure to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient, (\"API\"), in our drug candidates for use in our clinical trials or for commercial product, if any. In addition, we do not have the capability to encapsulate any of our drug candidates as a finished drug product for commercial distribution. As a result, we will be obligated to rely on contract manufacturers, if and when any of our drug candidates are approved for commercialization. We have not entered into an agreement with any contract manufacturers for commercial supply and may not be able to engage a contract manufacturer for commercial supply of any of our drug candidates on favorable terms to us, or at all.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit an NDA or BLA to the FDA or their equivalents to other relevant regulatory authorities. We will not control the manufacturing process of, and will be completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMPs for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. These cGMP regulations cover all aspects of the manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to our drug candidates. If our contract manufacturers do not successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our drug candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our drug candidates, if approved.\nOur contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. We will not have control over our contract manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure by any of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure to grant approval to market any of our drug candidates, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business. In addition, we will not have control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Failure by our contract manufacturers to comply with or maintain any of these standards could adversely affect our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market any of our drug candidates.\nIf, for any reason, these third parties are unable or unwilling to perform, we may not be able to terminate our agreements with them, and we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers or formulators or enter into favorable agreements with them and we cannot be certain that any such third parties will have the manufacturing capacity to meet future requirements. If these manufacturers or any alternate manufacturer of finished drug product experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes for our API or finished products or should cease doing business with us, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of any of our drug candidates or may not be able to create a supply of our drug candidates at all. Were we to encounter manufacturing issues, our ability to produce a sufficient supply of any of our drug candidates might be negatively affected. Our inability to coordinate the efforts of our third-party manufacturing partners, or the lack of capacity available at our third party manufacturing partners, could impair our ability to supply any of our drug candidates at required levels. Because of the significant regulatory requirements that we would need to satisfy in order to qualify a new bulk or finished product manufacturer, if we face these or other difficulties with our current manufacturing partners, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of any of our drug candidates if we decided to transfer the manufacture of any of our drug candidates to one or more alternative manufacturers in an effort to deal with the difficulties.\nAny manufacturing problem or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in lost sales. Additionally, we rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our potential products. Any reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to a future contract manufacturer caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of any of our drug candidates, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales.\nWe cannot guarantee that our future manufacturing and supply partners will be able to reduce the costs of commercial scale manufacturing of any of our drug candidates over time. If the commercial-scale manufacturing costs of any of our drug candidates are higher than expected, these costs may significantly impact our operating results. In order to reduce costs, we may need to develop and implement process improvements. However, in order to do so, we will need, from time to time, to notify or make submissions with regulatory authorities, and the improvements may be subject to approval by such regulatory authorities.\nWe cannot be sure that we will receive these necessary approvals or that these approvals will be granted in a timely fashion. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to enhance and optimize output in our commercial manufacturing process. If we cannot enhance and optimize output, we may not be able to reduce our costs over time.\nAny termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, any necessary studies of any of our drug candidates for any indications could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority failing to grant permission to proceed and placing the clinical study on hold;\n\u2022\nsubjects for clinical testing failing to enroll or remain in our trials at the rate we expect;\n\u2022\na facility manufacturing any of our drug candidates being ordered by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of cGMP requirements or other applicable requirements, or cross-contaminations of drug candidates in the manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nany changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u2022\nsubjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indications for which we are developing our drug candidates, or participating in competing clinical studies;\n\u2022\nsubjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n\u2022\nreports from clinical testing on similar technologies and products raising safety and/or efficacy concerns;\n\u2022\nthird-party clinical investigators losing their license or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or employing methods consistent with the clinical trial protocol, cGMP requirements, or other third parties not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\ninspections of clinical study sites by the FDA, comparable foreign regulatory authorities, or IRBs finding regulatory violations that require us to undertake corrective action, result in suspension or termination of one or more sites or the imposition of a clinical hold on the entire study, or that prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications;\n\u2022\nthird-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or any of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications;\n\u2022\none or more IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the study at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing its approval of the trial; reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\ndeviations of the clinical sites from trial protocols or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\nadding new clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe inability of the CRO to execute any clinical trials for any reason; and\n\u2022\ngovernment or regulatory delays or \"clinical holds\" requiring suspension or termination of a trial.\nProduct development costs for any of our drug candidates will increase if we have delays in testing or approval or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend study protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our study protocols to the FDA, comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of that study. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB, or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies of any of our drug candidates, its commercial prospects may be materially harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our drug candidates. In addition, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of any of our drug candidates could be significantly reduced.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing of drug candidates is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. We cannot assure you that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will view the results as we do or that any future trials of any of our drug candidates will achieve positive results. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Any future clinical trial results for our drug candidates may not be successful.\nIn addition, a number of factors could contribute to a lack of favorable safety and efficacy results for any of our drug candidates. For example, such trials could result in increased variability due to varying site characteristics, such as local standards of care, differences in evaluation period and surgical technique, and due to varying patient characteristics including demographic factors and health status.\nAlthough we may pursue expedited regulatory approval pathways for a drug candidate, it may not qualify for expedited development or, if it does qualify for expedited development, it may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nWe are pursuing track approval under 505(b)(2) for OPNT 003 and we believe there may be an opportunity to accelerate the development of certain of our other drug candidates through one or more of the FDA\u2019s expedited programs, such as fast track, breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval or priority review. However, we cannot be assured that any of our drug candidates will qualify for such programs.\nFor example, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Although breakthrough designation or access to any other expedited program may expedite the development or approval process, it does not change the standards for approval. If we apply for breakthrough therapy designation or any other expedited program for our drug candidates, the FDA may determine that our proposed target indication or other aspects of our clinical development plans do not qualify for such expedited program. Even if we are successful in obtaining a breakthrough therapy designation or access to any other expedited program, we may not experience faster development timelines or achieve faster review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. Access to an expedited program may also be withdrawn by the FDA if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Additionally, qualification for any expedited review procedure does not ensure that we will ultimately obtain regulatory approval for such drug candidate.\nWe may be exposed to product liability risks, and clinical and preclinical liability risks, which could place a substantial financial burden upon us should we be sued.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. We cannot be sure that claims will not be asserted against us. A successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot give assurances that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Claims or losses in excess of any product liability insurance coverage that we may obtain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products may have undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require it to be taken off the market, require it to include safety warnings or otherwise limit sales of the product.\nUnforeseen side effects from our products and product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the products have been marketed. This could cause regulatory approvals for, or market acceptance of, the products to be harder and more costly to obtain.\nTo date, no serious adverse events have been attributed to our products and product candidates. The results of our planned or any future clinical trials may show that our products and product candidates cause undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities with restrictive label warnings. If our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by the use of our products:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the products, which would force us to remove its products from the market;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication, or field alerts to physicians, pharmacies and others;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change instructions regarding the way the products are administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the products;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to limitations on how it may promote the products;\n\u2022\nsales of the products may decrease significantly;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or our potential future collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the products or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of our products.\nWe currently have a limited marketing and sales organization and we have no direct experience marketing pharmaceutical products. If we are unable to establish our own marketing and sales capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products after approval, we may not be able to generate product revenues.\nWe do not have a sales organization for the marketing, sales and distribution of any pharmaceutical products. In order to commercialize our products or any other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future, we must develop these capabilities on our own or make arrangements with third parties for the marketing, sales and distribution of its products. The establishment and development of our own sales force will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we cannot be certain that it would be able to successfully develop this capability. As a result, we may seek one or more partners to handle some or all of the sales, marketing and distribution of our products. There also may be certain markets within the United States and elsewhere for our products for which we may seek a co-promotion arrangement. However, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell our products on favorable terms, or at all. In the event, we are unable to develop its own marketing and sales force or collaborate with a third party marketing and sales organization, we will not be able to commercialize our products or any other product candidates that we develop, which will negatively impact our ability to generate product revenues. Furthermore, whether we commercialize products on our own or rely on a third party to do so, our ability to generate revenue would be dependent on the effectiveness of the sales force. In addition, to the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize our approved products, we would likely receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves.\nThe market for our products is rapidly changing and competitive, and new drugs, which may be developed by others, could impair our ability to maintain and grow our business and remain competitive.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render our technologies and products noncompetitive or obsolete. We also may be unable to keep pace with technological developments and other market factors. Technological competition from medical device, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities and budgets than we do, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us.\nOur reliance on collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize our products, such as the Adapt Agreement to develop and commercialize, NARCAN\u00ae is subject to inherent risks and may result in delays in product development and lost or reduced revenues, restricting our ability to commercialize our products and adversely affecting our profitability.\nWith respect to the products we have licensed, we depend upon collaborations with third parties to develop these product candidates and also depend substantially upon third parties to commercialize these products. As a result, our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, manufacture and commercialize our existing and possibly future product candidates depends upon our ability to maintain existing, and enter into and maintain new, contractual and collaborative arrangements with others. We also engage, and intend in the future to continue to engage, contract manufacturers and clinical trial investigators.\nIn addition, although not a primary component of our current strategy, the identification of new compounds or product candidates for development has led us in the past, and may continue to require us, to enter into license or other collaborative agreements with others, including other pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. Such collaborative agreements for the acquisition of new compounds or product candidates would typically require us to pay license fees, make milestone payments and/or pay royalties. Furthermore, these agreements may result in our revenues being lower than if we developed our product candidates and in our loss of control over the development of our product candidates.\nContractors or collaborators may have the right to terminate their agreements with us or reduce their payments to us under those agreements on limited or no notice and for no reason or reasons outside of our control. For example, we may be unable to maintain our relationship with Adapt/EBS on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, as the Adapt Agreement may be terminated by Adapt/EBS in its sole discretion, either in its entirety or in respect of one or more countries, at any time by providing 60 days prior notice to us. In addition, Adapt/EBS may have similar or more established relationships with our competitors or larger customers which may negatively impact our relationship with Adapt/EBS. Moreover, the loss for any reason of Adapt/EBS as a key partner could have a materially significant and adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to retain Adapt/EBS as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize NARCAN\u00ae and we may experience delays in or suspension of the marketing of our products. The same could apply to other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future. Our dependence upon third parties to assist with the development and commercialization of our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to generate profits or acceptable profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver such products on a timely and competitive basis. Additionally, our Aegis License Agreement shall expire upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties under the Aegis License Agreement; provided, however, that we shall have the right to terminate the License granted on a product-by-product or country-by-country basis upon 30 days\u2019 prior written notice to Aegis.\nIf our current or future licensees exercise termination rights they may have, or if these license agreements terminate because of delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, or for other reasons, and we are not able to establish replacement or additional research and development collaborations or licensing arrangements, we may not be able to develop and/or commercialize our product candidates. Moreover, any future collaborations or license arrangements we may enter into may not be on terms favorable to us.\nA further risk we face with the collaborations is that business combinations and changes in the collaborator or their business strategy may adversely affect their willingness or ability to complete their obligations to us.\nOur current or any future collaborations or license arrangements ultimately may not be successful. Our agreements with collaborators typically allows them discretion in electing whether to pursue various development, regulatory, commercialization and other activities, such as the Adapt Agreement.\nIf any collaborator were to breach its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct collaborative activities in a timely or successful manner, the pre-clinical or clinical development or commercialization of the affected product candidate or research program would be delayed or terminated.\nOther risks associated with our collaborative and contractual arrangements with others include the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not have day-to-day control over the activities of our contractors or collaborators;\n\u2022\nour collaborators may fail to defend or enforce patents they own on compounds or technologies that are incorporated into the products we develop with them;\n\u2022\nthird parties may not fulfill their regulatory or other obligations; and\n\u2022\nwe may not realize the contemplated or expected benefits from collaborative or other arrangements; and disagreements may arise regarding a breach of the arrangement, the interpretation of the agreement, ownership of proprietary rights, clinical results or regulatory approvals.\nThese factors could lead to delays in the development of our product candidates and/or the commercialization of our products or reduction in the milestone payments we receive, or could result in us not being able to commercialize our products. Further, disagreements with our contractors or collaborators could require or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time-consuming and expensive. Our ultimate success may depend upon the success and performance on the part of these third parties. If we fail to maintain these relationships or establish new relationships as required, development of our product candidates and/or the commercialization of our products will be delayed or may never be realized.\nOur product pipeline includes pre-clinical product candidates, such as a vaccine for heroin addiction. We may not be successful in completing the pre-clinical work required for these product candidates, the clinical trials necessary for obtaining market approval, or being able to commercially launch these product candidates.\nIn October 2016, we licensed a vaccine to treat heroin addiction from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (\"WRAIR\"). This is an early-stage asset and requires significant additional pre-clinical research and development before human testing may be initiated. We plan to work closely with scientists at WRAIR in order to advance the program into the clinic and determine if this vaccine is safe and effective in a patient population. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient pre-clinical data to apply for, or gain, the requisite authorizations to commence human clinical testing on either this asset or other pre-clinical assets we may pursue. However, even if we are successful moving a pre-clinical program into humans, the ultimate success of any development program is uncertain. If we obtain positive clinical data for either this or other pre-clinical assets we may develop, there will be a significant time lag before the asset gains regulatory approval or commercialization may begin, if ever.\nWe are exposed to product liability, non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon us should lawsuits be filed against us.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. We expect that such claims are likely to be asserted against us at some point. In addition, the use in our clinical trials of pharmaceutical formulations and products and the subsequent sale of these formulations or products by us or our potential collaborators may cause us to bear a portion of or all product liability risks. Any claim under any existing insurance policies or any insurance policies secured in the future may be subject to certain exceptions, and may not be honored fully, in part, in a timely manner, or at all, and may not cover the full extent of liability we may actually face. Therefore, a successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the products we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation of our Industry\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell future products and profitability. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cPPACA\u201d), which includes a number of health care reform provisions and requires most U.S. citizens to have health insurance. The new law, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added, which may require modification of business practices with health care practitioners.\nIn the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our future products, and we could be adversely affected by current and future health care reforms.\nWe are subject to intense regulation from the U.S. Government and such other governments and quasi-official regulatory bodies where our products are and product candidates may be sold.\nBoth before and after regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, including our product candidates, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, distribution and record keeping related to the product are subject to extensive, ongoing regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements and good clinical practice requirements for any clinical trials we conduct post-approval. As a result, we are subject to a number of governmental and other regulatory risks, which include:\n\u2022\nclinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process; delay and failure can occur at any stage of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment and regulatory approvals; we do not know whether our planned trials will begin on time, or at all, or will be completed on schedule, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities may not approve a clinical trial protocol or may place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u2022\nwe rely on third parties, such as consultants, contract research organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates and if we or any of our third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such as cGMP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the European Medicines Agency or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials;\n\u2022\nif the clinical development process is completed successfully, our ability to derive revenues from the sale of our product candidates will depend on us first obtaining FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory approvals, each of which are subject to unique risks and uncertainties;\n\u2022\nthere is no assurance that we will receive FDA or corollary foreign approval for any of our product candidates for any indication; we are subject to government regulation for the commercialization of our product candidates\n\u2022\nwe have not received regulatory approval in the United States for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\neven if one or more of our product candidates does obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve such product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than our requests, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or may approve with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate;\n\u2022\nundesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities;\n\u2022\nlater discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of FDA and other applicable United Statesc and foreign regulatory authorities could subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions;\n\u2022\nthe FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, and if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained; and\n\u2022\nwe may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials used in the operations of our business.\nIn addition, our operations are also subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. This statute has been applied to pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nFederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be present, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to\npay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes;\n\u2022\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nFederal \u201csunshine\u201d requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, and any ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\nState and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\nMany of our business practices are subject to scrutiny by regulatory and government enforcement authorities, as well as to lawsuits brought by private citizens under federal and state laws. Failure to comply with applicable law or an adverse decision in lawsuits may result in adverse consequences to us.\nThe laws governing our conduct in the U.S., and the conduct of collaborators, licensors or licensees on whom the success of our business relies, are enforceable by administrative, civil, and criminal penalties. Violations of laws such as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Social Security Act (including the Anti-Kickback Statute), and the Federal False Claims Act, and any regulations promulgated under the authority of the preceding, may result in a range of enforcement action including jail sentences, fines integrity oversight and reporting obligations and/or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, as may be determined by Medicare, Medicaid and the Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory authorities as well as by the courts in response to actions brought by the Department of Justice. FDA regulates drugs throughout the development process, from preclinical and clinical trials through approval and postmarketing requirements. Failure to fully comply with FDA law may cause the FDA to issue inspectional observations, untitled or warning letters, bring an enforcement action, suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall or institute fines or civil fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which (whether applied directly to us or to our collaborators, licensors, or licensees) could harm our reputation and our business. There can be no assurance that our activities, or those of our collaborators, licensors or licensees, will not come under the scrutiny of regulators and other government authorities or that our practices will not be found to violate applicable laws, rules and regulations or prompt lawsuits by private citizen \"relators\" under federal or state false claims laws.\nClinical trials for our product candidates have in some cases or may in the future be conducted outside the United States and not under an IND, and where this is the case, the FDA may not accept data from such trials.\nAlthough the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States and not under an IND in support of research or marketing applications for our product candidates, this is subject to certain conditions set out in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.120. For example, such foreign clinical trials should be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and obtaining the informed consent from subjects of the clinical trials. The FDA must also be able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if the agency deems it necessary. The foreign clinical data should also be applicable to the United States population and United States medical practice. Other factors that may affect the acceptance of foreign clinical data include differences in clinical conditions, study populations or regulatory requirements between the United States and the foreign country.\nLaws impacting the U.S. healthcare system are subject to a great deal of uncertainty, which may result in adverse consequences to our business.\nThere have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies. Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding coverage from government or commercial payors. Further proposed legislation, regulation and policy changes affecting third-party reimbursement are likely. Among other things, Congress has in the past proposed changes to and the repeal of the PPACA, and lawsuits have been brought challenging aspects of the law at various points. There have been repeated recent attempts by Congress to repeal or replace the PPACA. Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has previously been successful at passing comprehensive repeal legislation through both Chambers of Congress, it had then been vetoed by former President Obama and full repeal legislation is unlikely in the current political climate. However, Congress has passed two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December of 2017 included a provision that would repeal one of the primary pillars of the law, the PPACA\u2019s individual mandate penalty that essentially assessed a monetary penalty or fine on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the PPACA, including the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans and the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amends the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the PPACA on a provision-by-provision basis. In addition, there have been recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, control drug costs, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. We are unable to predict what legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future at the state or federal level, or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on us. Denial of coverage and reimbursement of our products, or the revocation or changes to coverage and reimbursement policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are planning to pursue the FDA 505(b)(2) pathway for our product candidates, and if we are not able to successfully do so, seeking approval of these product candidates through the 505(b)(1) NDA pathway would require full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness. Although we find the feedback received from the FDA to date generally encouraging toward our interest in pursuing the 505(b)(2) pathway for the treatment of AUD and opioid overdose, such feedback is preliminary only and includes a number of comments and recommendations that we will need to address in our drug development program to meet FDA standards for approval. In addition, our nasally delivered product candidates will include a drug delivery device, and that constituent part will be evaluated by the FDA, as will the combination products as a whole, under our NDA. Even if we are able to pursue the 505(b)(2), we could be subject to legal challenges and regulatory changes which might result in extensive delays or result in our 505(b)(2) application being unsuccessful.\nSection 505(b)(2) of the FDA permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable to us, would allow an NDA we submit to the FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA's prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved compounds, which could expedite the development program for a product candidate by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. We plan to pursue this pathway for our product candidates.\nIf the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we would need to reconsider our plans and might not be able to commercialize our product candidates in a cost-efficient manner, or at all. If we were to pursue approval under the 505(b)(1) NDA pathway, we would be subject to more extensive requirements and risks.\nIn addition, medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products, or medical devices are regulated as \u201ccombination products\u201d in the United States. Each constituent part of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of constituent part, whether a new drug, biologic, or device. In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by FDA of the primary mode of action of\nthe combination product, and typically one application (e.g., for a drug/device combination product assigned to CDER, an NDA - either under 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2)) will be made.\nWhen evaluating products that utilize a specific drug delivery system or device, the FDA will evaluate the characteristics of that delivery system and its functionality, as well as the potential for undesirable interactions between the drug and the delivery system, including the potential to negatively impact the safety or effectiveness of the drug. The FDA review process can be more complicated for combination products, and may result in delays, particularly if novel delivery systems are involved. We rely on third parties for the design and manufacture of the delivery systems for our products, and in some cases for the right to refer to their data on file with the FDA or other regulators. Quality or design concerns with the delivery system, or commercial disputes with these third-parties, could delay or prevent regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nIn some instances over the last few years, certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) and legally challenged decisions by the agency. If an FDA decision or action relative to our product candidate, or the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) more generally, is successfully challenged, it could result in delays or even prevent the FDA from approving a 505(b)(2) application for our product candidates.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. A claim by the applicant that a patent is invalid or will not be infringed is subject to challenge by the patent holder, requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval (i.e., a 30-month stay) of a 505(b)(2) application. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.\nEven if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to accelerated product development or earlier approval. Even if approved pursuant to the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, a drug may be subject to the same post-approval limitations, conditions and requirements as any other drug.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe price of our Common Stock could be highly volatile due to a number of factors, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nOn August 24, 2017, we received approval for up-listing to the Nasdaq Capital Market and our Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August 29, 2017. Our Common Stock closed as high as $50.50 and as low as $10.25 per share between August 29, 2017 and March 2, 2020. On March 2, 2020 the closing price of our Common Stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $11.70. Our Common Stock has experienced extreme price fluctuations. Some of the factors leading to this volatility include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of product releases by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of acquisitions and/or partnerships by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions.\nAlthough shares of our Common Stock currently trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cOPNT\u201d, there\nis no assurance that our stock will not continue to be volatile while listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market in the future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our Common Stock.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, but will review this policy from time to time as circumstances dictate.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could prevent or delay transactions that our stockholders may favor and may prevent stockholders from changing the direction of our business or management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, and may also frustrate or prevent any attempt by stockholders to change our direction or management. For example, these provisions:\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nestablish a staggered board of directors such that all members of the Board are not elected at one time;\n\u2022\nallow only the Board to fill any vacancy in the Board by reason of death, resignation or otherwise, or if the number of directors shall be increased; and\n\u2022\nrequire a vote of a majority of the shares of our outstanding stock entitled to vote at an election of directors to remove a director.\nCompliance with changing corporate governance and public disclosure regulations may result in additional expense.\nKeeping abreast of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations will require an increased amount of management attention and external resources. We intend to continue to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, which may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nOur Common Stock is thinly traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market exchange and no assurances can be made about stock performance, liquidity, or maintenance of our Nasdaq listing.\nHistorically, our Common Stock was quoted on the OTCQB, which provided significantly less liquidity than a securities exchange (such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market). On August 24, 2017, our Common Stock was approved for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Beginning on August 29, 2017, our Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cOPNT\u201d. Although currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s minimum listing requirements or that of any other national exchange. In addition, there can be no assurances that a liquid market will be created for our Common Stock. If we are unable to maintain listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market or if a liquid market for our Common Stock does not develop, our common stock may remain thinly traded.", "PERMNO": 16904, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "OPNT"}
