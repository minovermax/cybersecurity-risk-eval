The following summarizes what we believe to be the most important risks facing us that could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results. The information about these risks should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nMarket Risks\nOur business is significantly international in scope.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and Asia. Sales outside of the United States, including export sales from U.S. business locations, accounted for approximately 75% of our revenue in fiscal year 2015. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 exposure to the risk of currency value fluctuations, where payment for products is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars;\n\u00b7 variability in the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated assets, earnings and cash flows;\n\u00b7 difficulty enforcing agreements, including patent and trademarks, and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u00b7 trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S. and the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings;\n\u00b7 higher danger of terrorist activity, war or civil unrest, compared to domestic operations;\n\u00b7 imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;\n\u00b7 difficulty in staffing and managing global operations;\n\u00b7 required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applicable to our international operations and significant compliance costs and penalties for failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7 changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.\nVolatility in the global economy could adversely affect results.\nLong-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets would likely adversely affect our customers\u2019 operations and financing of both our international and U.S. customers and could therefore result in a decrease in orders. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers\u2019 spending patterns and financing availability could be negatively impacted, reducing demand for our products and services.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.\nAlthough our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a large portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in Euros, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan and other foreign currencies. Our profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against these currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on financial results. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported sales and earnings from our international operations will be lower because the applicable local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Euro or Japanese Yen, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition given that approximately 75% of our revenue has historically been derived from customers outside of the United States. As further described below, our fiscal year 2015 results were negatively impacted by currency translation.\nOur business is subject to strong competition.\nOur products are sold in competitive markets throughout the world. Competition is based on application knowledge, product features and design, brand recognition, reliability, technology, breadth of product offerings, price, delivery, customer relationships and after-market support. If we are not perceived as competitive in overall value as measured by these criteria, our customers would likely choose solutions offered by our competitors or developed internally.\nOur business is subject to customer demand cycles.\nFor many of our products, orders are subject to customers\u2019 procurement cycles and their willingness and ability to invest in capital, especially in the cyclical automotive, aircraft and machine tool industries. Any event that adversely impacts those customers\u2019 new product development activities may reduce their demand for our products.\nWe may experience difficulty obtaining materials or components for our products, or the cost of materials or components may increase.\nWe purchase materials and components from third-party suppliers, some of whom may be competitors. Other materials and components may be provided by a limited number of suppliers or by sole sources and could only be replaced with difficulty or at significant added cost. Additionally, some materials or components may become scarce or difficult to obtain in the market or they may increase in price. This could adversely affect the lead-time within which we receive the materials or components, and in turn affect our commitments to our customers, or could adversely affect the material cost or quality.\nInterest rate fluctuations could adversely affect results.\nSignificant changes in interest rates may affect our business in several ways, depending on our financial position and short-term financing needs. We may, at times, use debt to purchase shares of our common stock, finance working capital needs or finance the growth of the business through acquisitions. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs. We have not elected to mitigate this risk since our borrowings are typically outstanding for a short period of time. Increases in short-term interest rates may directly impact the amount of interest we are required to pay and reduce earnings accordingly. Conversely, lower interest rates will adversely impact the interest we earn on cash and short-term investments.\nOperational Risks\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, which could adversely affect our stock price and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs of October 3, 2015, we concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses related to our risk assessment, information and communications and monitoring processes with respect to revenue, identification of deliverables contained in multiple element revenue arrangements and timely closure of revenue projects and release of residual accrued costs have been identified and included in management\u2019s assessment. See Item 9A in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nWhile we are committed to remediating the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weaknesses, there can be no assurances that our remediation efforts will be successful or that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies (including material weaknesses) from happening that could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause our consolidated financial results to contain material misstatements, cause the market price of our common stock to decline, damage our reputation or have other potential material adverse consequences.\nThe changes we are making in Test processes and operating systems may not deliver the results we require for growth of the business.\nWe continue to invest in our Test operating model and modify our business processes and systems. We have restructured the business to make it a more scalable business model. Successful implementation of these initiatives is critical to our growth.\nOur business operations may be affected by government contracting risks.\nGovernment business is important to us. Revenue from U.S. Government contracts varies by year. Such revenue as a percent of our total revenue was approximately 3%, 5% and 5% for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting and result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. Failure to comply could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to secure future U.S. Government contracts and export control licenses and our results of operations and financial condition. These laws and regulations also create compliance risks and affect how we do business with federal agency clients. U.S. Government contracts, as well as contracts with certain foreign governments with which we do business, are also subject to modification or termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. Further, any investigation relating to, or suspension or debarment from, U.S. Government contracting could have a material impact on our results of operations as, during the duration of any suspension or debarment, we would be prohibited or otherwise limited in our ability to enter into prime contracts or subcontracts with U.S. Government agencies, certain entities that receive U.S. Government funds or that are otherwise subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and certain state government or commercial customers who decline to contract with suspended or debarred entities. A federal suspension could also impact our ability to obtain export control licenses, which have material importance to our business.\nWe are subject to risks because we design and manufacture first-of-a-kind products.\nWe design and build systems that are unique and innovative and, in some cases, the first created to address complex and unresolved issues. The design, manufacture and support of these systems may involve higher than planned costs. If we are unable to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, our reputation and ability to utilize our expertise will likely be damaged.\nThe backlog, sales, delivery and acceptance cycle for many of our products is irregular and may not develop as anticipated.\nMany of our products have long sales, delivery and acceptance cycles. In addition, our backlog is subject to order cancellations and our sales arrangements typically do not include specific cancellation provisions. If an order is cancelled, we typically would only be entitled to receive reimbursement from the customer for actual costs incurred under the arrangement plus a reasonable margin. Events may cause recognition of orders, backlog and results of operations to be aberrant over shorter periods of time. These factors include the timing of individual large orders which may be impacted by interest rates, customer capital spending and product development cycles, design and manufacturing problems, capacity constraints, delays in product readiness, damage or delays in transit, problems in achieving technical performance requirements and various customer-initiated delays. Any such delay may cause fluctuation in our reported periodic financial results.\nThe business could be adversely affected by product liability and commercial litigation.\nOur products or services may be claimed to cause or contribute to personal injury or property damage to our customers\u2019 facilities. Additionally, we are, at times, involved in commercial disputes with third parties, such as customers, vendors and others. The ensuing claims may arise singularly, in groups of related claims or in class actions involving multiple claimants. Such claims and litigation are frequently expensive and time-consuming to resolve, may result in substantial liability to us, which liability and related costs and expenses may not be recoverable through insurance or other forms of reimbursement.\nWe may experience difficulties obtaining and retaining the services of skilled employees.\nWe rely on knowledgeable, experienced and skilled technical personnel, particularly engineers, sales management and service personnel, to design, assemble, sell and service our products. We may be unable to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of such people, which could adversely affect our business. The inability to transfer knowledge and transition between roles within these teams could also adversely affect our business.\nWe may fail to protect our intellectual property effectively or may infringe upon the intellectual property of others.\nWe have developed significant proprietary technology and other rights that are used in our businesses. We rely on trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. While we take enforcement of these rights seriously, other companies such as competitors or others in markets in which we do not participate, may attempt to copy or use our intellectual property for their own benefit.\nIn addition, the intellectual property of others also has an impact on our ability to offer some of our products and services for specific uses or at competitive prices. Competitors\u2019 patents or other intellectual property may limit our ability to offer products and services to our customers. Any infringement on the intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or could increase the cost of providing, products and services.\nIntellectual property litigation is very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversions of our resources, both of which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of our intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our business operations and financial results could be adversely impacted.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of cyber attacks. Although we strive to have appropriate security controls in place, prevention of security breaches cannot be assured, particularly as cyber threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our security measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. The consequences of these risks could adversely impact our business operations and financial results.\nGovernment regulation imposes costs and other constraints.\nOur manufacturing operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations pertaining to health and safety matters, as well as the handling or discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. We expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these laws, and may incur penalties for any failure to do so. We may also be identified as a responsible party and be subject to liability relating to any investigation and clean-up of properties used for industrial purposes or the generation or disposal of hazardous substances. Some of our export sales require approval from the U.S. government. Changes in political relations between the U.S. and foreign countries and/or specific potential customers for which export licenses may be required, may cause a license application to be delayed or denied, or a previously issued license withdrawn, rendering us unable to complete a sale, or vulnerable to competitors who do not operate under such restrictions. Capital expenditures for environmental compliance were not material in fiscal year 2015, and we do not expect such expenditures will be material in fiscal year 2016 but the factors described above may cause our estimates to differ from our expectations.\nWe have been required to conduct a good faith reasonable country of origin analysis on our use of \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which has imposed and may impose additional costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks.\nThe SEC has promulgated final rules in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. While there is pending litigation challenging these rules, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. We have adopted a policy relating to conflict minerals, incorporating the standards set forth in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance, which affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As we continue our due diligence, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the procedures we have and may continue to implement. We may also encounter challenges in our efforts to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier.\nWe may not achieve our growth plans for the expansion of the business.\nIn addition to market penetration, our long-term success depends on our ability to expand our business through (a) new product development and service offerings; (b) mergers and acquisitions; and/or (c) geographic expansion.\nNew product development and service offerings require that we maintain our ability to improve existing products, continue to bring innovative products and services to market in a timely fashion and adapt products and services to the needs and standards of current and potential customers. Our products and services may become less competitive or eclipsed by technologies to which we do not have access or which render our solutions obsolete.\nMergers and acquisitions will be accompanied by risks that may include:\n\u00b7 suitable candidates may not exist or may not be available at acceptable costs;\n\u00b7 failure to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\n\u00b7 difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7 disruption of ongoing business and distraction of management from the ongoing business;\n\u00b7 dilution of existing stockholders and earnings per share;\n\u00b7 unanticipated, undisclosed or inaccurately assessed liabilities, legal risks and costs; and\n\u00b7 difficulties retaining the key vendors, customers or employees of the acquired business.\nAcquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside the U.S. will increase our exposure to the risks of international operations discussed in the operational risk factors.\nGeographic expansion may be outside of the U.S., and hence will be disproportionately subject to the risks of international operations discussed in the operational risk factors.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for long-lived assets.\nAs of October 3, 2015, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) totaled approximately $127,837. We periodically assess the value of these assets for impairment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our businesses, significant unexpected or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. No impairment was identified in fiscal year 2015. Future impairment charges could significantly affect results of operations in the periods for which any such impairment charges are recognized.", "PERMNO": 50623, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "MTSC"}
