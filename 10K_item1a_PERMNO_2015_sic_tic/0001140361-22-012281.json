{"cik": "1746129", "company": "Bank7 Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us. Any of the following risks, as well as risks that we do not know or currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Market\nOur business is concentrated in, and largely dependent upon, the continued growth and welfare of our markets, and adverse economic conditions in these markets could negatively impact our operations and customers.\nOur business is primarily affected by the economy of Oklahoma, and the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and to a smaller degree the State of Kansas. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, employment trends, deposits and real estate activity in these markets. In spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Oklahoma economy has been generally steady, if not increasing, in the past few years. The housing market remains strong with prices having increased through 2021. Vacancy rates for commercial properties remain low and small business owners are increasingly considering bank borrowings in order to grow.\nIn addition, market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact our charge-offs and provision for credit losses. Adverse changes in economic conditions in these markets could reduce our growth in loans and deposits, impair our ability to collect our loans, increase our problem loans and charge-offs and otherwise negatively affect our performance and financial condition.\nWe have credit exposure to the energy industry.\nThe energy industry is a significant sector in our Oklahoma market, and to a lesser extent, Kansas and the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area. A downturn or lack of growth in the energy industry and energy-related business, including sustained low oil or gas prices or the failure of oil or gas prices to rise in the future, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, our energy loans, which include loans to exploration and production companies, midstream companies, purchasers of mineral and royalty interests and service providers totaled $98.5 million, or 9.6% of total loans, as compared to $101.9 million, or 12.1% of total loans as of December 31, 2020. In addition to our direct exposure to energy loans, we also have indirect exposure to energy prices, as some of our non-energy customers\u2019 businesses are directly affected by volatility with the oil and gas industry and energy prices and otherwise are dependent on energy-related businesses. As of December 31, 2021, we had $9.4 million in unfunded commitments to borrowers in the oil and gas industry.\nWe have credit exposure to the hospitality industry.\nThe Company has loan exposure to the hospitality industry, primarily through loans made to construct or finance the operation of hotels. At December 31, 2021, this exposure was approximately $198.4 million, or 19.2%, of the total loan portfolio, along with an additional $41.5 million in unfunded debt, as compared to $194.3 million, or 23.2%, of the total loan portfolio, along with an additional $65 million in unfunded debt as of December 31, 2020. The hospitality industry is subject to changes in the travel patterns of business and leisure travelers, both of which are affected by the strength of the economy, as well as other factors. The performance of the hospitality industry has traditionally been closely linked with the performance of the general economy and, specifically, growth in gross domestic product. Changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers, particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term. Although we have made a large portion of our hospitality loans to long-term, well-established hotel operators in strategic locations, a general downturn in the supply growth of such markets or hotel occupancy or room rates could negatively impact the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay. A significant loss in this portfolio could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID pandemic, including variants of the coronavirus, has adversely affected the U.S. economy and our customers, which has had, and may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe COVID pandemic, including variants of the coronavirus, continues to negatively impact the United States and the world. The spread of COVID and the responses of federal, state and local governments have negatively impacted the U.S. economy and our customers, including through periods of economic recession, volatile levels of unemployment, increased inflation, supply chain and labor shortages, and other trends, all of which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business and operations.\nIn particular, these trends have, among other things, negatively impacted loan demand and our growth strategy, and increased the risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, and losses on our loans, particularly for our customers with exposure to the hospitality industry\n.\nThe ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change, and even if after the pandemic subsides, we may continue to experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global economic impact of the pandemic and related governmental and social responses.\nWe have a concentration in commercial real estate lending that could cause our regulators to restrict our ability to grow.\nAs a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices, or the CRE Concentration Guidance, with respect to a financial institution\u2019s concentrations in CRE lending activities. The CRE Concentration Guidance identifies certain concentration levels that, if exceeded, will expose the institution to additional supervisory analysis with regard to the institution\u2019s CRE concentration risk. The CRE Concentration Guidance is designed to promote appropriate levels of capital and sound loan and risk management practices for institutions with a concentration of CRE loans. In general, the CRE Concentration Guidance establishes the following supervisory criteria as preliminary indications of possible CRE concentration risk: (1) the institution\u2019s total construction, land development and other land loans represent 100% or more of total capital; or (2) total CRE loans as defined in this guidance, or Regulatory CRE, represent 300% or more of total capital, and the institution\u2019s Regulatory CRE has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36-month period. Pursuant to the CRE Concentration Guidance, loans secured by owner occupied CRE are not included for purposes of the CRE concentration calculation. As of December 31, 2021, our Regulatory CRE represented 302.47% of our total Bank capital and our construction, land development and other land loans represented 129.02% of our total Bank capital, as compared to 343.8% and 93.5% as of December 31, 2020, respectively. During the prior 36-month period, our Regulatory CRE has decreased 32.8%. We are actively working to manage our Regulatory CRE concentration, and we believe that our underwriting policies, management information systems, independent credit administration process, and monitoring of real estate loan concentrations are currently sufficient to address the CRE Concentration Guidance. We have implemented enhanced CRE monitoring techniques as expected by banking regulators as our concentrations have approached or exceeded the regulatory guidance. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve could become concerned about our CRE loan concentrations, and it could limit our ability to grow by restricting its approvals for the establishment or acquisition of branches, or approvals of mergers or other acquisition opportunities, or by requiring us to raise additional capital, reduce our loan concentrations or undertake other remedial actions.\nBecause a portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAdverse developments affecting real estate values, particularly in Oklahoma City and the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area, could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. Real estate values may experience periods of fluctuation, and the market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, and could result in losses that adversely affect credit quality, financial condition and results of operation. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1.0 billion of commercial purpose loans, which include general commercial, energy, agricultural, and CRE loans, representing approximately 97.7% of our gross loan portfolio. Commercial purpose loans are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, their repayment is more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy.\nAccordingly, a downturn in the real estate market or the general economy could heighten our risk related to commercial purpose loans, particularly energy and CRE loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers\u2019 ability to make repayment from their employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial purpose loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers\u2019 ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loan may be impaired. As a result of the larger average size of each commercial purpose loan as compared with other loans such as residential loans, as well as the collateral which is generally less readily marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial purpose loans could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur largest loan relationships make up a material percentage of our total loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our 20 largest borrowing relationships ranged from approximately $13.4 million to $33.6 million (including unfunded commitments) and totaled approximately $405 million in total commitments (representing, in the aggregate, 32.7% of our total outstanding commitments as of December 31, 2021). Each of the loans associated with these relationships has been underwritten in accordance with our underwriting policies and limits. Along with other risks inherent in these loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying businesses or property securing these loans, this concentration of borrowers presents a risk that, if one or more of these relationships were to become delinquent or suffer default, we could be exposed to material losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover losses associated with any of these relationships, and any loss or increase in the allowance would negatively affect our earnings and capital. Even if these loans are adequately collateralized, an increase in classified assets could harm our reputation with our regulators and inhibit our ability to execute our business plan.\nOur largest deposit relationships currently make up a material percentage of our deposits and the withdrawal of deposits by our largest depositors could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources.\nAt December 31, 2021, our 20 largest deposit relationships accounted for 23.2% of our total deposits. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors or by one of our related customer groups could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding for our business and withdrawal demands, adversely affecting our net interest margin and results of operations. We may also be forced, as a result of withdrawals of deposits, to rely more heavily on other, potentially more expensive and less stable funding sources. Additionally, such circumstances could require us to raise deposit rates in an attempt to attract new deposits, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Under applicable regulations, if the Bank were no longer \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d the Bank would not be able to accept brokered deposits without the approval of the FDIC.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of loans maturing within one year, and there is no guarantee that these loans will be replaced upon maturity or renewed on the same terms or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 38.4% of our gross loans were maturing within one year, compared to approximately 43.2% of our gross loans that were maturing within one year as of December 31, 2020. As a result, we will either need to renew or replace these loans during the course of the year. There is no guarantee that these loans will be originated or renewed by borrowers on the same terms or at all, as demand for such loans may decrease. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that borrowers will qualify for new loans or that existing loans will be renewed by us on the same terms or at all, as collateral values may be insufficient or the borrowers\u2019 cash flow may be materially less than when the loan was initially originated. This could result in a significant decline in the size of our loan portfolio.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover our actual loan losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is appropriate to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio. While we strive to carefully monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become nonperforming, at any time there are loans included in the portfolio that will result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem loans. We cannot be sure that we will be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit losses on those loans that are identified. As a result, future additions to the allowance may be necessary. Additionally, future additions may be required based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers, such as may result from changes in economic conditions or as a result of incorrect assumptions by management in determining the allowance. Federal banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Commercial and commercial real estate loans comprise a significant portion of our total loan portfolio. These types of loans typically are larger than residential real estate loans and other consumer loans. Because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming assets. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the allowance for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future.\nWe have certain loans, investment securities and subordinated debt securities indexed to LIBOR to calculate the interest rate. The continued availability of the LIBOR index is not guaranteed after the United Kingdom administrators of LIBOR have announced that the publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be published after June 2023. We cannot predict, in the interim, whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. With respect to our loan assets, at this time, there is some industry guidance regarding acceptable alternatives to LIBOR. After review and analysis from the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Alternative Reference Rates Committee, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published its final rule recommending the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as a compliant replacement index to LIBOR that would not trigger a refinance under existing regulations for certain consumer loans. Loan contracts may also contain alternate rate language permitting transfer to SOFR, Wall Street Journal Prime or another index when LIBOR is no longer available. The timing and manner in which each customer\u2019s contract transitions to a new index will vary on a case-by-case basis. There continues to be some uncertainty related to the LIBOR transition. New index rates and payments will differ from LIBOR, which may lead to increased volatility. The transition has impacted our market risk profiles and required changes to our risk and pricing models, valuation tools, and product design. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. With respect to investment securities and subordinated debt securities, we expect similar transition issues. Failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends on interest rates generally, and we may be adversely affected by changes in market interest rates.\nOur profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest income depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of our control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies and economic conditions generally. Our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments.\nChanges in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and deposits. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the demand for loans and interest rates. Loan origination volume usually declines during periods of rising or high interest rates and increases during periods of declining or low interest rates. Changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of certain of our assets, including loans and other assets, on our balance sheet.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increase the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of any underlying property that serves as collateral for such loans may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonaccrual loans would have an adverse impact on net interest income.\nRising interest rates in prior periods have increased interest expense, which in turn has adversely affected net interest income, and may do so in the future if the Federal Reserve raises rates as anticipated. In a rising interest rate environment, competition for cost-effective deposits increases, making it more costly to fund loan growth. In addition, a rising rate environment could cause mortgage and mortgage warehouse lending volumes to substantially decline. Any rapid and unexpected volatility in interest rates creates uncertainty and potential for unexpected material adverse effects. The Company actively monitors and manages the balances of maturing and repricing assets and liabilities to reduce the adverse impact of changes in interest rates, but there can be no assurances that the Company can avoid all material adverse effects that such interest rate changes may have on the Company\u2019s net interest margin and overall financial condition.\nThe ratio of variable- to fixed-rate loans in our loan portfolio, the ratio of short-term (maturing at a given time within 12 months) to long-term loans, and the ratio of our demand, money market and savings deposits to certificates of deposit (and their time periods), are the primary factors affecting the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The composition of our rate-sensitive assets or liabilities is subject to change and could result in a more unbalanced position that would cause market rate changes to have a greater impact on our earnings. Fluctuations in market rates and other market disruptions are neither predictable nor controllable and may adversely affect our financial condition and earnings.\nWe rely on short-term funding, which can be adversely affected by local and general economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $1.0 billion, or 85.4%, of our deposits consisted of demand, savings, money market and negotiable order of withdrawal, or NOW, accounts. Approximately $177.6 million of the remaining balance of deposits consists of certificates of deposit, of which approximately $135.8 million, or 76.5% of remaining deposits, was due to mature within one year. Based on our experience, we believe that our savings, money market and non-interest-bearing accounts are relatively stable sources of funds. Historically, a majority of non-brokered certificates of deposit are renewed upon maturity as long as we pay competitive interest rates. Many of these customers are, however, interest-rate conscious and may be willing to move funds into higher-yielding investment alternatives. Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, as well as our cost of funds, has been, and will continue to be significantly affected by general economic conditions. In addition, as market interest rates rise, we will have competitive pressure to increase the rates we pay on deposits. If we increase interest rates paid to retain deposits, our earnings may be adversely affected.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and could jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. The Bank\u2019s primary funding source is customer deposits. In addition, the Bank has historically had access to advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka, or the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, or the FRB, discount window and other wholesale sources, such as internet-sourced deposits to fund operations. We participate in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service, or CDARS, where customer funds are placed into multiple certificates of deposit, each in an amount under the standard FDIC insurance maximum of $250,000, and placed at a network of banks across the United States. Although the Bank has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, it might not be able to replace such funds in the future. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on acceptable terms could be impaired by factors that affect our organization specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory actions against us. The Bank\u2019s ability to borrow or attract and retain deposits in the future could be adversely affected by the Bank\u2019s financial condition or regulatory restrictions, or impaired by factors that are not specific to it, such as FDIC insurance changes, disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking industry. Borrowing capacity from the FHLB or FRB may fluctuate based upon the condition of the Bank or the acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at the lender\u2019s discretion.\nThe FRB or FHLB could restrict or limit the Bank\u2019s access to secured borrowings. Correspondent banks can withdraw unsecured lines of credit or require collateralization for the purchase of fed funds. Liquidity also may be affected by the Bank\u2019s routine commitments to extend credit. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences.\nAny substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and could jeopardize our financial condition.\nWe are exposed to cybersecurity risks associated with our internet-based systems and online commerce security, including \u201chacking\u201d and \u201cidentify theft.\u201d\nWe conduct a portion of our business over the internet. We rely heavily upon data processing, including loan servicing and deposit processing, software, communications and information systems from a number of third parties to conduct our business. As a bank, we are more likely to be targeted by cyber-attacks in an effort to unlawfully access customer funds or customer personally identifiable information. Cybersecurity concerns are further heightened by Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine.\nThird-party or internal systems and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled due to deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Our operations are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, spam attacks, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access and other unforeseen events. Undiscovered data corruption could render our customer information inaccurate. These events may obstruct our ability to provide services and process transactions. While we believe we are in compliance with all applicable privacy and data security laws, an incident could put our customer confidential information at risk.\nAlthough we have not experienced a cyber-incident which has been successful in compromising our data or systems, we can never be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to breaches of security or other technological difficulties or failures. We monitor and modify, as necessary, our protective measures in response to the perpetual evolution of known cyber-threats.\nA breach in the security of any of our information systems, or other cyber-incident, could have an adverse impact on, among other things, our revenue, ability to attract and maintain customers and our reputation. In addition, as a result of any breach, we could incur higher costs to conduct our business, to increase protection, or related to remediation. Furthermore, our customers could incorrectly blame us and terminate their account with us for a cyber-incident which occurred on their own system or with that of an unrelated third party. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend to a significant extent on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, we receive core systems processing, essential web hosting and other internet systems, loan and deposit processing and other processing services from third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Even if we are able to replace our service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which increases the cost and expense of compliance and could limit or restrict our activities, which in turn may adversely impact our earnings and ability to grow.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the OBD, and the FDIC. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors, customers and the DIF, rather than for the benefit of shareholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters relating to ownership and control of our shares, our acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities for us to engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels, dividend payments and other aspects of our operations. These bank regulators possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. Following examinations, we may be required, among other things, to change our asset valuations or the amounts of required loan loss allowances or to restrict our operations, as well as increase our capital levels, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business, profitability or growth strategy. Increased regulation could increase our cost of compliance and adversely affect profitability. Moreover, certain of these regulations contain significant punitive sanctions for violations, including monetary penalties and limitations on a bank\u2019s ability to implement components of its business plan, such as expansion through mergers and acquisitions or the opening of new branch offices. In addition, changes in regulatory requirements may add costs associated with compliance efforts. Furthermore, government policy and regulation, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve, significantly affect credit conditions. Negative developments in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation and regulation in response to those developments could negatively impact our business operations and adversely impact our financial performance.\nMonetary policy and other economic factors could affect our profitability adversely.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share non-public personal information about our customers with non-affiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with non-affiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards appropriate based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. On November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies issued a new rule effective in 2022 that requires banks to notify their regulators within 36 hours of a \u201ccomputer-security incident\u201d that rises to the level of a \u201cnotification incident.\u201d This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level.\nWe rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide information technology and data services. Although we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts and perform information security risk assessments of its third-party service providers and business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. In addition, despite the security measures that we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. In such cases, notification to affected individuals, state and federal regulators, state attorneys general and media may be required, depending upon the number of affected individuals and whether personal information including financial data was subject to unauthorized access.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting customer or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nShares of certain shareholders may be sold into the public market. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nOur principal shareholders (collectively, the \u201cHaines Family Trusts\u201d) have the benefit of certain registration rights covering all of their shares of our common stock pursuant to the registration rights agreement that we entered into with the Haines Family Trusts in connection with our initial public offering. Sales of a substantial number of these shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or to be lower than it might otherwise be. In addition, as of December 31, 2021 approximately 59.3% of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned by our principal shareholders, executive officers and directors. The substantial amount of common stock that is owned by and issuable to our principal shareholders, executive officers and directors may adversely affect our share price, our share price volatility and the development and persistence of an active and liquid trading market. The sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nWe are controlled by trusts established for the benefit of members of the Haines family, whose interests may not coincide with our other shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Haines Family Trusts control approximately 51.2% of our common stock. So long as the Haines Family Trusts continue to control more than 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, they will have the ability, if they vote in the same manner, to determine the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, the approval of mergers, material acquisitions and dispositions and other extraordinary transactions, and amendments to our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other corporate governance documents. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of our Company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of the Haines Family Trusts. The Haines Family Trusts also have certain rights, such as registration rights, that our other shareholders do not have. In any of these matters, the interests of the Haines Family Trusts may differ from or conflict with our interests as a company or the interests of other shareholders. Accordingly, the Haines Family Trusts could influence us to enter into transactions or agreements that other shareholders would not approve or make decisions with which other shareholders may disagree.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of NASDAQ, and qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance listing standards, meaning that more than 50% of the voting power for the election of our board of directors will be held by a single person, entity or group. As a controlled company, we are exempt from the obligation to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:\n\u2022\nthat a majority of our board of directors consists of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under NASDAQ rules;\n\u2022\nthat director nominations are selected, or recommended for the board of directors\u2019 selection, by either (i) the independent directors constituting a majority of the board of directors\u2019 independent directors in a vote in which only independent directors participate, or (ii) a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthat we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nEven though we are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we currently intend to comply with each of these requirements. However, we may avail ourselves of certain of these other exemptions for as long as we remain a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d Accordingly, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance requirements, which could make our stock less attractive to investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nWe are a bank holding company and our only source of cash, other than further issuances of securities, is distributions from the Bank.\nWe are a bank holding company with no material activities other than activities incidental to holding the common stock of the Bank. Our principal source of funds to pay distributions on our common stock and service any of our obligations, other than further issuances of securities, would be dividends received from the Bank. Furthermore, the Bank is not obligated to pay dividends to us, and any dividends paid to us would depend on the earnings or financial condition of the Bank and various business considerations. As is the case with all financial institutions, the profitability of the Bank is subject to the fluctuating cost and availability of money, changes in interest rates and in economic conditions in general. In addition, various federal and state statutes limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company without regulatory approval.\nWe have entered into a tax sharing agreement with the Haines Family Trusts, and we could become obligated to make payments to the Haines Family Trusts for any additional federal, state or local income taxes assessed against them for tax periods prior to the completion of our initial public offering.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we were treated as an S Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Haines Family Trusts, as our shareholders, were taxed on our income. Therefore, the Haines Family Trusts have received certain distributions from us that were generally intended to equal the amount of tax such trusts were required to pay with respect to our income. In connection with our initial public offering, our S Corporation status terminated. As a result of such termination, effective September 24, 2018 we are subject to federal and state income taxes. In the event an adjustment to our taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the date of the termination of our S Corporation status results in any increase in taxable income of the Haines Family Trusts for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending prior to termination of our S Corporation status, it is possible that the Haines Family Trusts would be liable for additional income taxes for such prior periods. Therefore, we have entered into an agreement with the Haines Family Trusts. Pursuant to this agreement, in the event of any restatement of our taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the date of termination of our S Corporation status pursuant to a determination by, or a settlement with, a taxing authority, then, depending on the nature of the adjustment, we may be required to make a payment to the Haines Family Trusts in an amount equal to their incremental tax liability, which amount may be material. In addition, we will indemnify the Haines Family Trusts with respect to unpaid income tax liabilities to the extent that such unpaid income tax liabilities are attributable to our taxable income for any period after our S Corporation status terminates. In both cases, the amount of the payment will be based on the assumption that the Haines Family Trusts are taxed at the highest rate applicable to individuals for the relevant periods. We will also indemnify the Haines Family Trusts for any interest, penalties, losses, costs or expenses arising out of any claim under the agreement. However, the Haines Family Trusts will indemnify us with respect to our unpaid tax liabilities (including interest and penalties) to the extent that such unpaid tax liabilities are attributable to a decrease in the shareholders\u2019 taxable income for any for tax period and a corresponding increase in the Company\u2019s taxable income for any period. The Haines Family Trusts will also indemnify the Company with respect to any additional taxes attributable to our final S Corporation tax year that ends with the termination of our S Corporation status.", "PERMNO": 18106, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BSVN"}
