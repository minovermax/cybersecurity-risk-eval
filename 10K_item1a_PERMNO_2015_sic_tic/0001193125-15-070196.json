{"cik": "41719", "company": "GLATFELTER P H CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a weak global economic environment or downturns in the target markets that we serve.\nAdverse global economic conditions could impact our target markets resulting in decreased demand for our products.\nApproximately $125 million of our annual revenue is earned from shipments to customers located in Ukraine, Russia and members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (also known as \u201cCIS\u201d). Uncertain geo-political and economic conditions in this region, oil prices, and weak currencies have and may continue to cause significant volatility in demand for our products as well as our customers buying patterns.\nApproximately 20% of our net sales in 2014 were shipped to customers in western Europe, the demand for which, in many cases, is dependent on economic conditions in this area, or to the extent such customers do business outside of Europe, in other regions of the world.\nOur results could be adversely affected if economic conditions weaken or fail to improve. In the event of significant currency weakening in the countries into which our products are sold, demand for or pricing of our products could be adversely impacted. Also, there may be periods during which demand for our products is insufficient to enable us to operate our production facilities in an economical manner. As a result, we may be forced to take machine downtime. The economic environment may also cause customer insolvencies which may result in their inability to satisfy their financial obligations to us. These conditions are beyond our ability to control and may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs we diversify our business and expand our global footprint, an increasing proportion of our revenue is generated outside of the United States. We own and operate manufacturing facilities in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Philippines. Currently, the majority of our business is transacted in U.S. dollars; however, an increasing portion of business is transacted in Euros, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollars or Philippine Peso. Our euro denominated revenue exceeds euro expenses by approximately \u0080120 million. With respect\nGLATFELTER 2014 FORM 10-K 7\nto the British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, and Philippine Peso, we have greater outflows than inflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree. As a result, particularly with respect to the euro, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant.\nEconomic weakness, the potential inability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations, and the related actions of this region\u2019s central banks has caused, and could continue to cause, the value of the euro to weaken. As a result, our operating results could be negatively impacted. In the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, business may be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established.\nOur ability to maintain our products\u2019 price competitiveness is reliant, in part, on the relative strength of the currency in which the product is denominated compared to the currency of the market into which it is sold and the functional currency of our competitors. Changes in the rate of exchange of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other currencies, may adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to offer products in certain markets at acceptable prices. For example, approximately $125 million of our annual revenue is earned from shipments to customers located in Ukraine, Russia and members of the CIS. Although these sales are denominated in euros, a significant weakening of the customers\u2019 local currencies could adversely affect our customers\u2019 credit risk and our revenue and results of operation.\nThe cost of raw materials and energy used to manufacture our products could increase and the availability of certain raw materials could become constrained.\nWe require access to sufficient and reasonably priced quantities of pulpwood, purchased pulps, pulp substitutes, abaca fiber, synthetic fibers, and certain other raw materials.\nOur Specialty Papers\u2019 locations are vertically integrated manufacturing facilities that can generate approximately 85% of their annual pulp requirements.\nOur Philippine mill purchases abaca fiber to produce abaca pulp a key fiber used to manufacture paper for single-serve coffee, tea and technical specialty products at our Gernsbach, Sca\u00ebr, and Lydney facilities. At certain times, the supply of abaca fiber has been constrained due to factors such as weather related damage to the source crop as well\nas decisions by land owners to produce alternative crops in lieu of those used to produce abaca fiber.\nOur Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit requires access to sufficient quantities of fluff pulp, the supply of which is subject to availability of certain softwoods. Softwood availability can be limited by many factors, including weather in regions where softwoods are abundant.\nThe cost of many of our production materials, including petroleum based chemicals and freight charges, are influenced by the cost of oil. In addition, coal is a principal source of fuel for both the Spring Grove and Chillicothe facilities. Natural gas is used as a source of fuel at Chillicothe and our Composite Fibers and Advanced Airlaid Materials business units\u2019 facilities.\nGovernment rules, regulations and policies have an impact on the cost of certain energy sources, particularly for our European operations. We currently benefit from a number of government sponsored programs designed to mitigate the cost of electricity to larger industrial consumers of power related to initiatives such as green energy or renewable energy sources. As the political environment changes, any reduction in the extent of government sponsored incentives may adversely affect the cost ultimately borne by our operations.\nAlthough we have contractual cost pass-through arrangements with certain Advanced Airlaid Materials\u2019 customers, we may not be able to fully pass increased raw materials or energy costs on to all customers if the market will not bear the higher price or if existing agreements with our customers limit price increases. If price adjustments significantly trail increases in raw materials or energy prices, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur industry is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profitability.\nSpecialty Papers The global markets in which we compete have been adversely affected by capacity exceeding the demand for products, increased imports from foreign competitors and by uncoated free sheet demand which has been declining by 3% to 4% per year. As a result, the industry has taken steps to reduce capacity. However, slowing demand or increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross margins and net income. The greater financial resources of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions. Certain competitors may also\nhave the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThere have been periods of supply/demand imbalance in our industry which have caused pulp prices and our products\u2019 selling prices to be volatile. The timing and magnitude of price increases or decreases in these markets have generally varied by region and by product type. A sustained period of weak demand or excess supply would likely adversely affect pulp prices and our products\u2019 selling prices. This could have a material adverse affect on our operating and financial results.\nSome of the other factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in Specialty Papers markets in which we participate include:\n\u2022\nthe entry of new competitors into the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nthe prevelance of imported product, particularly uncoated free sheet, into the U.S.;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of commodity-based producers to enter our markets when they are unable to compete or when demand softens in their traditional markets;\n\u2022\nthe aggressiveness of our competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share;\n\u2022\nour failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences;\n\u2022\nthe impact of electronic-based substitutes for certain of our products such as carbonless and forms, book publishing, and envelope papers;\n\u2022\nthe impact of replacement or disruptive technologies;\n\u2022\nchanges in end-user preferences;\n\u2022\nour inability to develop new, improved or enhanced products;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain the cost efficiency of our facilities; and\n\u2022\nthe cost of regulatory environmental compliance requirements.\nComposite Fibers and Advanced Airlaid Materials The global markets in which we compete, although growing, are not as large as the markets for Specialty Papers. As a result, our ability to compete is more sensitive to and may be adversely impacted by the following:\n\u2022\nthe entry of new competitors into the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nthe aggressiveness of our competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share;\n\u2022\nour failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; and\n\u2022\ntechnological advances or changes that impact production of our products.\nThe impact of any significant changes as noted or otherwise may result in our inability to effectively compete in the markets in which we operate, and as a result our sales and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to develop new products acceptable to our customers.\nOur business strategy is market focused and includes investments in developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers and to maintain our market share. Our success will depend, in part on our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that keep pace with introductions by our competitors and changing customer preferences. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these factors, we may lose opportunities for business with both current and potential customers. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nanticipate and properly identify our customers\u2019 needs and industry trends;\n\u2022\nprice our products competitively;\n\u2022\ndevelop and commercialize new products and applications in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ndifferentiate our products from our competitors\u2019 products; and\n\u2022\ninvest efficiently in research and development activities.\nOur inability to develop new products could adversely impact our business and ultimately harm our profitability.\nGLATFELTER 2014 FORM 10-K 9\nWe are subject to substantial costs and potential liability for environmental matters.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. To comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial capital and operating expenditures. The Clean Air Act, and similar regulations, will impose significant compliance costs or require significant capital expenditures. Compliance with the Clean Air Act will require process modifications and/or installation of air pollution controls on boilers at two of our facilities, as well as connecting to gas pipelines. Because of the complexities of this initiative, our inability to successfully complete all aspects of the project could adversely impact the expenditures required or our results of operations.\nWe anticipate that environmental regulation of our operations will continue to become more burdensome and that capital and operating expenditures necessary to comply with environmental regulations will continue, and perhaps increase, in the future. Because environmental regulations are not consistent worldwide, our ability to compete globally may be adversely affected by capital and operating expenditures required for environmental compliance. In addition, we may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment, such as air and water quality, resulting from mills we operate or have operated. Potential obligations include compensation for the restoration of natural resources, personal injury and property damages. See Item 1 - Environmental Matters for an additional discussion of expected costs to comply with environmental regulations.\nWe continue to have exposure to potential liability for remediation and other costs related to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls in the lower Fox River on which our former Neenah, Wisconsin mill was located. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to provide significant contributions to fund remediation efforts in the near term and/or ultimately pay material amounts to resolve our liability in the Fox River matter. We have financial reserves for environmental matters, including the Fox River site, but we cannot be certain that those reserves will be adequate to provide for future obligations related to these matters, that our share of costs and/or damages\nfor these matters will not exceed our available resources, or that such obligations will not have a long-term, material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur environmental issues are complex and should be reviewed in the context set forth in more detail in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 23.\nThe Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit generates a substantial portion of its revenue from one customer serving the hygiene products market, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdvanced Airlaid Materials generates the majority of its net sales of hygiene products from one customer. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on their operating results. In addition, sales to the feminine hygiene market accounted for 77% of Advanced Airlaid Materials\u2019 net sales in 2014 and sales are concentrated within a small group of large customers. A decline in sales of hygiene products could have a material adverse effect on this unit\u2019s operating results. Our ability to effectively compete could be affected by technological advances which may introduce alternative or substitute products into this market segment. Customers in the airlaid non-woven fabric material market, including the hygiene market, may also switch to less expensive products, change preferences or otherwise reduce demand for Advanced Airlaid Material\u2019s products, thus reducing the size of the markets in which it currently sells its products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects.\nOur operations may be impaired and we may be exposed to potential losses and liability as a result of natural disasters, acts of terrorism or sabotage or similar events.\nIf we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen operational problem at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production which could impair our ability to satisfy customer demands.\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding or fire, and acts of terrorism or sabotage affecting our operating activities and major facilities could materially and adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we own and maintain three dams in York County, Pennsylvania, that were built to ensure a steady\nsupply of water for the operation of our facility in Spring Grove which is a primary manufacturing location for our envelope papers and engineered products. Each of these dams is classified as \u201chigh hazard\u201d by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania because they are located in close proximity to inhabited areas. Any sudden failure of a dam, including as a result of natural disaster or act of terrorism or sabotage, would endanger occupants and residential, commercial and industrial structures, for which we could be liable. The failure of a dam could also be extremely disruptive and result in damage to or the shutdown of our Spring Grove mill. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams may not be fully covered by our insurance policies or may substantially exceed the limits of our policies, and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, many of our papermaking operations require a reliable and abundant supply of water. Such mills rely on a local water body or water source for their water needs and, therefore, are particularly impacted by drought conditions or other natural or manmade interruptions to its water supplies. At various times and for differing periods, each of our mills has had to modify operations due to water shortages, water clarity, or low flow conditions in its principal water supplies. Any interruption or curtailment of operations at any of our paper mills due to drought or low flow conditions at the principal water source or another cause could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur pulp mill in Lanao del Norte on the Island of Mindanao in the Republic of the Philippines is located along the Pacific Rim, one of the world\u2019s hazard belts. By virtue of its geographic location, this mill is subject to, among similar types of natural disasters discussed above, cyclones, typhoons, and volcanic activity. Moreover, the area of Lanao del Norte has been a target of suspected terrorist activities. The most common bomb targets in Lanao del Norte to date have been power transmission towers. Our pulp mill in Mindanao is located in a rural portion of the island and is susceptible to attacks or power interruptions. The Mindanao mill supplies the abaca pulp that is used by our Composite Fibers business unit to manufacture our paper for single serve coffee and tea products and certain technical specialties products. Any interruption, loss or extended curtailment of operations at our Mindanao mill could affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products and materially affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have operations in a potentially politically and economically unstable location.\nOur pulp mill in the Philippines is located in a region that is unstable and subject to political unrest. As discussed above, our Philippine pulp mill produces abaca pulp, a significant raw material used by our Composite Fibers business unit, and is currently our main provider of abaca pulp. There are limited suitable alternative sources of readily available abaca pulp in the world. In the event of a disruption in supply from our Philippine mill, there is no guarantee that we could obtain adequate amounts of abaca pulp from alternative sources at a reasonable price or at all. As a consequence, any civil disturbance, unrest, political instability or other event that causes a disruption in supply could limit the availability of abaca pulp and would increase our cost of obtaining abaca pulp. Such occurrences could adversely impact our sales volumes, revenues and operating results.\nOur international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.\nWe have significant operations and assets located in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of unique risks, in addition to the risks in our domestic sales and operations, including differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, differing regulatory environments, difficulty in managing widespread operations and political instability. These factors may adversely affect our future profits. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. Any such limitations would restrict our flexibility in using funds generated in those jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to cyber-security risks related to unauthorized or malicious access to sensitive customer, vendor, company or employee information as well as to the technology that supports our operations and other business processes.\nOur business operations rely upon secure systems for mill operations, data capture, processing, storage and\nGLATFELTER 2014 FORM 10-K 11\nreporting. Although we maintain appropriate data security and controls, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers, could become subject to cyber attacks. Systems such as ours are inherently exposed to cyber-security risks and potential for attacks. The result of such attacks could result in a breach of data security and controls. Such a breach of our network, systems, applications or data could result in operational disruptions or damage or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us, denial of access to the applications we use to plan our operations, procure materials, manufacture and ship products and account for orders, theft of intellectual knowhow and trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents.\nAny of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could adversely affect our results of operations, create negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.\nIn the event any of the above risk factors impact our business in a material way or in combination during the same period, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to simultaneously fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy obligations and make dividend payments on our common stock.\nIn addition to debt service obligations, our business is capital intensive and requires significant expenditures to support growth strategies, research and development initiatives, environmental compliance, and for normal upgrades or replacements. We expect to meet all of our near and long-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents, our existing credit facility and other long-term debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from these sources, we could be unable to meet our near and long-term cash needs or make dividend payments.", "PERMNO": 57154, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "GLT"}
