{"cik": "1004434", "company": "AFFILIATED MANAGERS GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nWe and our Affiliates face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses. The following are some of the more important factors that could affect our and our Affiliates\u2019 businesses. Certain statements in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d are forward-looking statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY, BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nOur financial results depend on our Affiliates\u2019 receipt of asset and performance based fees, and are impacted by investment performance, as well as changes in fee levels, product mix and the relative levels of assets under management among our Affiliates.\nOur financial results depend on our Affiliates\u2019 receipt of asset and performance based fees, which may vary substantially from year to year. Our Affiliates\u2019 ability to maintain current fee levels depends on a number of factors, including our Affiliates\u2019 investment performance, as well as competition and trends in the asset management industry, including investor demand for passively-managed products, including exchange traded funds, that typically carry lower fee rates, or preferences for other developing strategies or trends. Further, different types of assets under management can generate different ratios of asset based fees to assets under management (\u201casset based fee ratio\u201d), based on factors such as the investment strategy and the type of client. Thus, a change in the composition of our assets under management, either within an Affiliate or among our Affiliates, could result in a decrease in our aggregate fees even if our aggregate assets under management remains unchanged or increases. Products that use fee structures based on investment performance may also vary significantly from period to period, depending on the investment performance of the particular product. For some of our Affiliates, performance based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a product underperforms on an absolute basis or relative to its benchmark, it must regain such underperformance before the Affiliate will earn any performance based fees. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, our Affiliates may reduce or waive fees on certain products for particular time periods, to attract or retain assets or for other reasons. No assurances can be given that our Affiliates will be able to maintain current fee structures or levels. A reduction in the fees that our Affiliates receive could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our structured partnership interests are tailored to meet the needs of each Affiliate and are therefore varied, and our earnings may be adversely affected by changes in the relative performance or in the relative levels and mix of assets under management among our Affiliates, independent of our aggregate operating performance measures. Further, certain Affiliates contribute more significantly to our results than other Affiliates and, therefore, changes in fee levels, product mix, assets under management or investment performance of such Affiliates could have a disproportionate adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results could be adversely affected by any reduction in our assets under management, which could reduce the asset and performance based fees earned by our Affiliates.\nOur financial results may be impacted by changes in the total level of our assets under management. The total level of our assets under management generally or with respect to particular products or Affiliates could be adversely affected by conditions outside of our control, including:\n\u2022a decline in the market value of our assets under management, due to declines or heightened volatility in the capital markets, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, inflation rates or the yield curve, and other market factors;\n\u2022changes in investor risk tolerance or investment preferences, which could result in investor allocations away from active, return-oriented strategies offered by our Affiliates;\n\u2022our Affiliates\u2019 ability to attract and retain client assets and market products and services, which may be impacted by investment performance, client relationships, demand for product and service offerings, and the prices of securities generally;\n\u2022global economic conditions, which may be exacerbated by changes in the equity or debt markets;\n\u2022financial crises, political or diplomatic developments, public health crises, such as pandemics, trade wars, social or civil unrest, insurrection, war, terrorism, or natural disasters; and\n\u2022other factors that are difficult to predict.\nA reduction in our assets under management could adversely affect the fees payable to our Affiliates and, ultimately, our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our or our Affiliates\u2019 reputations are harmed, we could suffer losses in our business and financial results.\nThe success of our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our Affiliates and our stockholders, our ability to compete for future investment opportunities, and our and our Affiliates\u2019 reputations among existing and potential clients. Our and our Affiliates\u2019 reputations are critical to our business and could be impacted by events that may be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. For example, alleged or actual failures by us, our Affiliates or our respective employees to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, errors in our public reports, cyber-attack or data breach incidents, expectations and perceptions of our or our Affiliates\u2019 ESG practices, threatened or actual litigation against us, any of our Affiliates or our respective employees, or the public announcement and potential publicity surrounding any of these issues, even if inaccurate, satisfactorily addressed, or if no violation or wrongdoing actually occurred, could adversely impact our or our Affiliates\u2019 reputations and their relationships with clients, our relationships with our Affiliates, and our ability to negotiate agreements with new independent investment firms, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe asset management industry is highly competitive.\nOur Affiliates compete with a broad range of domestic and foreign investment management firms, including public, private and client-owned investment advisers; firms managing passively-managed products, including exchange traded funds, as well as other firms managing active, return-oriented strategies; firms associated with securities broker-dealers, financial institutions, insurance companies, private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds; and other entities. These firms may have significantly greater financial, technological and marketing resources, captive distribution and assets under management, and many of these firms offer an even broader array of products and services in particular investment strategies, including ESG strategies and other developing strategies and trends. These firms may also compete by seeking to capitalize on a trend towards institutions consolidating the number of investment managers they work with. Competition from these firms may reduce the fees that our Affiliates can obtain for investment management services, or could impair our Affiliates\u2019 ability to attract and retain client assets. We believe that our Affiliates\u2019 ability to compete effectively with other firms depends upon our Affiliates\u2019 strategies, investment performance, reputations, client relationships, fee structures, client-servicing capabilities, and the marketing and distribution of their investment strategies, among other factors. See \u201cCompetition\u201d in Item 1. Our Affiliates may not compare favorably with their competitors in any or all of these categories. From time to time, our Affiliates may also compete with each other for clients.\nInvestment management contracts are subject to termination on short notice.\nThrough our Affiliates, we derive almost all of our asset and performance based fees from clients pursuant to investment management contracts. While certain of our Affiliates\u2019 private equity and alternative products have long-term commitment periods, many of our Affiliates\u2019 investment management contracts are terminable by the client without penalty upon relatively short notice (typically not longer than 60 days). We cannot be certain that our Affiliates will be able to retain their existing clients or attract new clients. If our Affiliates\u2019 clients terminate their investment management contracts or withdraw a substantial amount of assets, it is likely to harm our results of operations. In addition, investment management contracts with mutual funds or other retail products are subject to annual approval by the fund\u2019s board of directors.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and existing or future resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.\nWhile we believe that our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for normal operations for the foreseeable future, our continuing acquisitions of interests in independent investment firms and our other strategic initiatives may require additional capital. Further, we have significant repurchase obligations relating to Affiliate equity interests, and it is difficult to predict the frequency and magnitude of these repurchases. As of December 31, 2020, the current redemption value relating to Affiliate equity repurchase obligations was presented within Redeemable non-controlling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and was $671.5 million, which includes $35.4 million of consolidated Affiliate sponsored investment products primarily attributable to third-party investors. See \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources-Affiliate Equity\u201d in Item 7 and Notes 17 and 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These obligations may require more cash than is then available from our existing cash resources and cash flows from operations. Thus, we may need to raise capital through additional borrowings or by selling shares of our common stock or other equity or debt securities, or otherwise refinance a portion of these obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding debt of $2.5 billion. Our level of indebtedness may increase if we fund future investments or other expenses through borrowings. Any additional indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and may require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness.\nThe financing activities described above could increase our Interest expense, decrease our Net income (controlling interest) or dilute the interests of our existing stockholders. In addition, our access to additional capital, and the cost of capital we are able to access, is influenced by a number of factors, including the state of global credit and equity markets, interest rates, credit spreads and our credit ratings. We are rated A3 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service and BBB+ by S&P Global Ratings. A reduction in our credit ratings could also increase our borrowing costs under our credit facilities or, in certain cases, give rise to a termination right by the counterparty under our derivative financial instruments.\nOur debt agreements impose certain covenants relating to the conduct of our business, including financial covenants under our credit facilities, any breach of which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any amounts borrowed or outstanding thereunder.\nOur debt agreements contain customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, place certain limitations on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur debt, merge or transfer assets, and create liens and, in the case of our credit facilities, require us to maintain specified financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The breach of any covenant (either due to our actions or omissions or, in the case of financial covenants, due to a significant and prolonged market-driven decline in our operating results) could result in a default under the applicable debt agreement and, in the case of our credit facilities, lenders could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us. Further, in the event of certain defaults, amounts borrowed under our debt agreements, together with accrued interest and other fees, could become immediately due and payable. If any indebtedness were to become subject to accelerated repayment, we may not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full.\nWe have substantial intangibles on our balance sheet, and any impairment of our intangibles could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total assets were $7.9 billion, of which $3.7 billion were intangibles, and $2.1 billion were equity method investments in Affiliates, an amount primarily composed of intangible assets. We cannot be certain that we will realize the value of such intangible assets. Our intangible assets may become impaired as a result of any number of factors, including changes in market conditions, declines in the value of assets under management, client attrition, product performance, reductions in fee rates and changes in strategic objectives or growth prospects of an Affiliate. An impairment of our intangible assets or an other-than-temporary decline in the value of our equity method investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Determining the value of intangible assets, and evaluating them for impairment, requires management to exercise significant judgment. In recent periods, we have recorded expenses to reduce the carrying value to fair value of certain Affiliates and certain acquired client relationships, and may experience similar impairment events in future reporting periods. See \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\u201d in Item 7 and Notes 9 and 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMarket risk management activities may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we and our Affiliates seek to offset exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and markets by entering into derivative financial instruments. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The scope of these risk management activities is selective and varies based on the level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other changing market conditions. We and our Affiliates do not seek to hedge exposure to all market risks, which means that exposure to certain market risks is not limited. Further, the use of derivative financial instruments does not entirely eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the value of the underlying position or prevent losses if the value of the position declines, and also can limit the opportunity for gain if the value of the position increases. There can be no assurance that our or our Affiliates\u2019 derivative financial instruments will meet their overall objective or that we or our Affiliates will be successful in entering into such instruments in the future. Further, while hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail other risks, may generate significant transaction costs, and may require the posting of cash collateral. For example, if our or our Affiliates\u2019 counterparties fail to honor their obligations in a timely manner, including any obligations to return posted collateral, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nThe anticipated replacement of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) introduces a number of risks for us, our Affiliates and their clients, and for the global asset management industry more broadly.\nLIBOR and other financial benchmarks are currently the subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Currently, LIBOR is expected to be discontinued, but there remains uncertainty as to such timing, as well as the nature of any replacement rate. These reforms may have consequences that create uncertainties, including changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmark indices, which could impact Affiliate sponsored investment products, investments, derivatives or other instruments, and may result in pricing, operational and legal implementation risks. Further, the proposed reforms could result in an increase in our or our Affiliates\u2019 debt service costs. While it is not currently possible to determine precisely how, or to what extent, the withdrawal and replacement of LIBOR or the alteration of any other financial benchmarks would affect us and our Affiliates, the changes may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, the outbreak of COVID-19, which the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in early 2020, is ongoing. This pandemic has adversely impacted the global economy and contributed to significant volatility in equity and debt markets. Many jurisdictions continue to institute quarantines, limitations on travel, and restrictions on access to schools, offices, and other public venues. Businesses have implemented similar precautionary measures, many of which remain in effect. Such measures, as well as the general uncertainty surrounding the containment and impact of COVID-19, have created significant disruption in economic activity.\nThese developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, the timing and effectiveness of vaccines, the terms and duration of mandated shut downs and other restrictions, and the impact on the global economy and financial markets, as well as the extent of the impact on us and our Affiliates, remain difficult to predict and will depend on a number of factors, including actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties that are not within our control. If financial markets become depressed for a prolonged period as a result of the COVID-19 or another pandemic or public health crisis, our assets under management, aggregate fees, and earnings could be adversely affected and our intangible assets could become impaired. These developments could also increase our costs of capital or reduce the availability of credit, or adversely change the interest rates or credit ratings applicable to us. Further, our growth strategy depends in part upon our ability to make investments in independent investment firms and to pursue other strategic partnerships. Our ability to pursue these transactions could be impacted during the period of market and economic disruption relating to COVID-19 or another pandemic or public health crisis, as a result of the availability of capital or other factors. Additionally, although we maintain contingency plans for pandemics and we and our Affiliates have remained fully operational throughout the pandemic, the further spread of COVID-19, or an outbreak of another contagious disease, could also impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our or our Affiliates\u2019 businesses or the business and operations of third parties that perform critical services for our or our Affiliates\u2019 businesses.\nThese factors and others relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, or of another highly infectious or contagious disease, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, or cause volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGY AND OUR STRUCTURED PARTNERSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES\nOur growth strategy depends in part upon our ability to make investments in independent investment firms and to pursue other strategic partnerships.\nOur continued success in investing in independent investment firms will depend upon our ability to find suitable firms in which to invest or make additional investments in our existing Affiliates, our ability to negotiate agreements with such firms on acceptable terms, and our ability to raise the capital necessary to finance such transactions. The market for acquisitions of interests in these firms is highly competitive. Many other public and private financial services companies, including commercial and investment banks, private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and investment management firms, also invest in boutique investment firms and may have significantly greater resources than we do. In addition to direct competition on particular prospects, these firms can also negatively impact the volume and value of transactions more broadly. Further, our long-term innovative partnership approach with our Affiliates is designed to provide succession planning and enhanced equity incentives for management equity owners, and the management of some target firms may prefer terms and structures offered by our competitors.\nThe success of our investments depends on our and our Affiliates\u2019 ability to grow their businesses and carry out their management succession plans. In addition, our investments involve a number of risks, including the existence of unknown liabilities that may arise after making an investment, some of which may depend upon factors that are not under our control.\nWe may not be successful in making investments in new firms or maintaining existing investments, and any firms that we do invest in may not have favorable results or performance following our investment, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the consummation of our announced investments is generally subject to a number of closing conditions, contingencies and approvals, including, but not limited to, obtaining certain consents of the independent investment firm\u2019s clients and applicable regulatory approvals. In the event that an announced transaction is not consummated, we may experience a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur growth strategy also includes pursuing strategic partnerships in areas where we can assist our Affiliates in growing and diversifying their businesses. These strategic partnerships may involve risks and require resources and investment, and there is no certainty that such partnerships will deliver the anticipated benefits over the expected time frame or at all.\nThe structure of our partnership interests in our Affiliates may expose us to unanticipated changes in Affiliate revenue, operating expenses and other commitments, which we may not anticipate and may have limited ability to control.\nFor a majority of our Affiliates, we use structured partnership interests in which we contractually share in the Affiliate\u2019s revenue without regard to expenses. In this type of structured partnership interest, the Affiliate allocates a specified percentage of its revenue to us and Affiliate management, while using the remainder of its revenue for operating expenses and for additional distributions to Affiliate management. In these types of structures, while our distributions generally have priority, our agreed allocations may not anticipate changes in the revenue and operating expense base of the Affiliate, and the revenue remaining after our specified share is allocated to us may not be large enough to cover all of the Affiliate\u2019s operating expenses, which could result in a reduction of the amount allocated to us or could negatively impact the Affiliate\u2019s operations and prospects.\nFor other Affiliates, we use structured partnership interests in which we contractually share in the Affiliate\u2019s revenue less agreed-upon expenses. This type of partnership interest allows us to benefit from any increase in revenue or any decrease in the agreed-upon expenses, but also exposes us to any decrease in revenue or any increase in such expenses. The degree of our exposure to expenses from these structured partnership interests varies by Affiliate and includes Affiliates in which we fully share in the expenses of the business. In these types of structures, we may have limited or no ability to control the level of expenses at the Affiliate, and our distributions generally do not have priority. Further, the impact of Affiliate expenses on our earnings and our stock price could increase if the portion of our earnings derived from such Affiliates increases.\nAs a result of these factors, unanticipated changes in revenue, operating expenses or other commitments at any of our Affiliates could leave the Affiliate with a shortfall in remaining funds for distribution to us or Affiliate management, or for funding their operations. Changes in the global marketplace in particular could result in rapid changes to our Affiliates\u2019 earnings or expenses, and our Affiliates may be unable to make appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner to respond to such changes. Any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our financial condition generally and on our results of operations for the applicable reporting period.\nAdditionally, regardless of the particular structure, we may elect to defer or forgo the receipt of our share of an Affiliate\u2019s revenue or earnings, or to adjust any expenses allocated to us, to permit the Affiliate to fund expenses in light of unanticipated changes in revenue or operating expenses, with the aim of maximizing the long-term benefits. We cannot be certain that any such deferral or forbearance would be of any greater long-term benefit to us, and such a deferral or forbearance may have an adverse effect on our near- or long-term financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may reposition or divest our equity interests in our Affiliates, and we cannot be certain that any such repositioning or divestment will benefit us in the near- or long-term.\nFrom time to time, we may reposition our relationships with our Affiliates, which could, among other things, include changes to our structured partnership interests, including changes in our ownership level and in the calculation of our share of revenue and/or operating expenses. Such repositioning may be done in order to address an Affiliate\u2019s succession planning, changes in its revenue or operating expense base, strategic planning or other developments. Any repositioning of our interest in an Affiliate may result in increased exposure to changes in the Affiliate\u2019s revenue and/or operating expenses, or in additional investments or commitments from us, or could increase or reduce our interest in the Affiliate. In some cases, this could result in the full divestment of our interest to Affiliate management or to a third party, or in our acquisition of all of the equity interests of the Affiliate. In addition, certain of our Affiliates accounted for under the equity method have customary rights in certain circumstances to sell a majority interest in their firm to a third party and to cause us to participate in such sale. Any such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our Affiliates rely on certain key personnel and cannot guarantee their continued service.\nWe depend on the efforts of our executive officers and our other officers and employees. Our executive officers, in particular, play an important role in the stability and growth of our existing Affiliates and in identifying potential investments in independent investment firms. There is no guarantee that these executive officers will remain with the Company. We generally do not have employment agreements with our executive officers, although each has a significant deferred equity interest in the Company and is subject to non-solicitation and non-competition restrictions that may be triggered upon their departure. Further, we seek to attract and retain our key officers and employees through a number of initiatives and programs, including developing a strong values-based culture, a commitment to career development, employee engagement, attractive compensation and benefits programs, attention to succession planning, and fostering of diversity and inclusion, any of which may not be successful in contributing to the retention of such employees. Changes in our management team, in particular, may be disruptive to our business, and failure to attract and retain members of our executive or senior management team, or to effectively implement and manage appropriate succession plans, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our Affiliates depend heavily on the services of key principals who, in many cases, have managed their firms for many years. These principals often are primarily responsible for their firm\u2019s investment decisions. Although we use a combination of economic incentives, transfer restrictions and, in some instances, non-solicitation, non-competition and employment agreements in an effort to retain key Affiliate personnel, there is no guarantee that these principals will remain with their firms. Since certain of our Affiliates contribute more significantly to our revenue than other Affiliates, the loss of key personnel at these Affiliates could have a disproportionately adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nEquity markets and our common stock have been volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience volatility, and the broader equity markets have experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors. In addition, announcements of our financial and operating results or other material information, including changes in net client cash flows and assets under management, changes in our financial guidance or our failure to meet such guidance, our new investments activity, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, perceptions regarding our ESG profile, and other developments affecting us, our Affiliates or our competitors, as well as geopolitical, social, regulatory, capital markets, economic, and business factors unrelated to us, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nThe sale or issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the expectation that such sales or issuances will occur, could adversely impact the price of our common stock.\nThe sale or issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely impact its price. In connection with our financing activities, we have issued junior convertible trust preferred securities and entered into an equity distribution program, either of which may result in the issuance of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events. We also have exercisable options outstanding and unvested restricted stock that have been awarded under our share-based incentive plans. Additionally, we have the right to settle certain Affiliate equity repurchase obligations with shares of our common stock. Moreover, in connection with future financing activities, we may issue additional convertible securities or shares of our common stock, including through forward equity transactions. Any such issuance of shares of our common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current equity holders. In the event that a large number of shares of our common stock are sold or issued in the public market, or the expectation that such sales or issuances will occur, the price of our common stock may decline as a result.\nProvisions in our organizational documents, Delaware law and other factors could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, or adversely affect our financial results in periods prior to and following a change in control.\nProvisions in our charter and by-laws and anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control of the Company. These provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to replace our executive officers without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the terms, rights, and preferences of the preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022the prohibition on the right of stockholders to call meetings or act by written consent and limitations on the right of stockholders to present proposals or make nominations at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022legal restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock.\nFurther, given our long-term innovative partnership approach with our Affiliates, which is designed to maintain their unique entrepreneurial cultures, investment independence, and operational autonomy in managing their businesses, a change in control may be viewed negatively by our Affiliates, impacting their relationships with us. Additionally, the disposition of certain of our Affiliates following a change in control could result in the immediate realization of taxes owed on any excess proceeds above our tax basis in the relevant Affiliate, which could impact the valuation a third party may apply to us in a change in control. Any of the forgoing factors may inhibit a change in control in circumstances that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price of our common stock, or may result in negative impacts on our financial results in periods prior to and following a change in control.\nIn addition, a change in control of the Company or the acquisition of a large ownership position in shares of our outstanding common stock by a single holder may constitute a change in control for certain of our Affiliates for purposes of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act. In that case, absent client consents, the Affiliate\u2019s management agreements may be deemed to be \u201cassigned\u201d in violation of the agreement and, for mutual fund clients, will terminate. We cannot be certain that any required client consents (which the impacted Affiliates would need to be involved in requesting) would be obtained if such a change of control occurs. Any termination, deemed assignment or renegotiation of any of our Affiliates\u2019 management agreements could result in a reduction in our assets under management or the fees payable to our Affiliates and, ultimately, our aggregate fees. Further, certain of our Affiliates operate regulated businesses in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. that, in some cases, require regulatory notifications and other filings if a single stockholder acquires an ownership position in the Company exceeding certain specified thresholds, regardless of whether a change in control has occurred for purposes of the Advisers Act or the Investment Company Act. Such an ownership position could also trigger approvals under FINRA, for Affiliates operating a broker-dealer in the U.S. As a result, a large ownership position in our stock, whether or not resulting in a change of control of the Company, could result in increased regulatory reporting and compliance costs, and potential restrictions on our or our Affiliates\u2019 business activities, and could reduce the fees that our Affiliates receive under investment management contracts, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nOur and our Affiliates\u2019 businesses are highly regulated.\nOur and our Affiliates\u2019 businesses are subject to complex and extensive regulation by regulatory and self-regulatory authorities and exchanges in various jurisdictions around the world, which, for our Affiliates and our U.S. retail distribution subsidiary, include those applicable to investment advisers, as detailed in \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d in Item 1. Applicable laws, rules and regulations impose requirements, restrictions and limitations on our and our Affiliates\u2019 businesses, and can result in significant compliance costs. Further, this regulatory environment may be altered without notice by new laws or regulations, revisions to existing laws or regulations, or new or revised interpretations, guidance or enforcement priorities. Any determination of a failure to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could expose us, our Affiliates, or our respective employees to civil liability, criminal liability, or disciplinary or enforcement action, with penalties that could include the disgorgement of fees, fines, sanctions, suspensions, termination of adviser status, or censure of individual employees or revocation or limitation of business activities or registration, any of which could have an adverse impact on our stock price, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, if we, any of our Affiliates or our respective employees were to fail to comply with applicable laws, rules, or regulations, or be named as a subject of an investigation or other regulatory action, the public announcement and potential publicity surrounding any such investigation or action could have an adverse effect on our stock price and result in increased costs, even if we, our Affiliates, or our respective employees were found not to have violated such laws, rules or regulations.\nRecently implemented and proposed regulations globally have called for more stringent oversight of the financial services industry in which we and our Affiliates operate. In the U.S., the new presidential administration may shift enforcement priorities under existing regulations, alter existing regulations or pursue additional rulemaking impacting the financial services industry. These regulatory developments could adversely affect our and our Affiliates\u2019 businesses, increase compliance costs, require that we or our Affiliates curtail operations or investment offerings, or impact our and our Affiliates\u2019 access to capital and the market for our common stock.\nFurther, in recent years, regulators in the U.S., the UK and other jurisdictions have expanded rules and devoted greater resources and attention to the enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws, and while we and our Affiliates have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these rules, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations.\nOur and our Affiliates\u2019 international operations are subject to foreign risks, including political, regulatory, economic and currency risks.\nWe and certain of our Affiliates conduct business outside the U.S., and a number of our Affiliates are based outside the U.S. and, accordingly, are subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally. These risks may include difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, longer payment cycles, difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable, different (and in some cases less stringent) legal, regulatory and accounting regimes, political instability, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, expatriation controls, expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences. For example, our and our Affiliates\u2019 businesses may be impacted by the terms of trade agreements negotiated by the UK in connection with its exit from the European Union, which could result in fluctuations in exchange rates, disruptions in the capital markets, changes in investor risk tolerance or investment preferences, potential regulatory shifts resulting from the UK\u2019s status as a third-country with the European Union, increased compliance and administrative costs, or other impacts. Further, as part of our and certain of our Affiliates\u2019 response to the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union, we and such Affiliates have implemented changes to our business operations and, while we do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on our or our Affiliates\u2019 businesses, these changes could result in increased compliance and administrative outsourcing and costs. Additionally, regulations in the European Union pertaining to integrating ESG topics may materially impact the asset management industry in member states that adopt such legislation. For example, the European Union\u2019s recent action plan on financing sustainable growth includes initiatives to integrate ESG into the financial system, including such areas as MiFID2, UCITS and AIFMD regulations. Similar regulatory measures may be introduced in other jurisdictions in which we or our Affiliates currently have investments or plan to invest in the future, including in the U.S. and the UK. These types of ESG-related regulations could impact our or our Affiliates\u2019 businesses, increases regulatory and compliance costs and adversely affect our profitability. In addition, as a result of operating internationally, certain of our Affiliates and our global distribution subsidiaries are subject to requirements under foreign regulations to maintain minimum levels of capital, and such capital requirements may be increased from time to time, which may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital and the payment of distributions to us. These or other risks related to our and our Affiliates\u2019 international operations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, and our Affiliates are generally subject to taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, and significant judgment is required in estimating and evaluating tax provisions and accruals. Our and our Affiliates\u2019 effective tax rates could be affected by a change in the mix of earnings with differing statutory tax rates, changes to our or their existing businesses, and changes in relevant tax, accounting or other laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations. In the U.S., the new presidential administration has indicated that it may raise the corporate tax rate and may pursue other tax reforms. If any such proposals are ultimately enacted into legislation, they could materially impact our tax provision, deferred tax assets, tax liabilities and effective tax rate. Further, a portion of our earnings is from outside of the U.S., and the foreign government agencies in jurisdictions in which we and our Affiliates do business continue to focus on the taxation of multinational companies, and could implement changes to their tax laws. For example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), which includes recommendations that may be adopted in various jurisdictions in which we and our Affiliates do business. Any changes to federal, state or foreign tax laws, regulations, accounting standards or administrative practices, or the release of additional guidance, interpretations or other information, could impact our estimated effective tax rate and overall tax expense, as well as our earnings estimates, and could result in adjustments to our treatment of deferred taxes, including the realization or value thereof, or in unanticipated additional tax liabilities, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we and our Affiliates may be subject to tax examinations by certain federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of examinations that we are subject to, in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision; however, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken or may take, and may assess\nadditional taxes and/or penalties and interest. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of any examinations and the actual outcomes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe or our Affiliates may be involved in legal proceedings and regulatory matters from time to time, and we may be held responsible for liabilities incurred by certain of our Affiliates.\nOur operating agreements with our Affiliates provide for governance structures that give Affiliate management the authority to manage and operate their businesses on a day-to-day basis, including investment management operations, marketing, product development, client relationships, employee matters, compensation programs, and compliance activities. As a consequence, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by problems stemming from the day-to-day operations of our Affiliates that we are not involved in, and where weaknesses or failures in internal processes or systems, legal or regulatory matters, or other operational challenges could lead to a disruption or cessation of our Affiliates\u2019 operations, liability to their clients, exposure to claims or disciplinary action, or reputational harm.\nCertain of our Affiliates are limited liability companies or limited partnerships (or equivalent non-U.S. forms) of which we, or entities controlled by us, are the managing member or general partner (or equivalent). Consequently, to the extent that any of these Affiliates incur liabilities or expenses that exceed their ability to pay for them, we may be directly or indirectly liable for their payment. Similarly, an Affiliate\u2019s payment of distributions to us may be subject to claims by potential creditors, and an Affiliate may default on distributions that are payable to us. In addition, with respect to each of these Affiliates, we may be held liable in some circumstances as a control person for the acts of the Affiliate or its employees. Further, we also conduct distribution, sales, and marketing activities through our U.S. retail distribution subsidiary and our global distribution subsidiaries, to extend the reach of our Affiliates\u2019 own business development efforts, and any liability arising in connection with these activities, whether as a result of our own actions or the actions of our participating Affiliates, could result in direct liability to us. Accordingly, we and our Affiliates may face various claims, litigation or complaints from time to time, and we cannot predict the eventual outcome of such matters, some of which may be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us or our Affiliates, or whether any such matters could become material to a particular Affiliate or us in any reporting period. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Item 3. While we and our Affiliates maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance in amounts believed to be adequate to cover potential liabilities, we cannot be certain that we or our Affiliates will not have claims or related expenses that exceed the limits of available insurance coverage, that the insurers will remain solvent and will meet their obligations to provide coverage, or that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us and our Affiliates with sufficient limits and at a reasonable cost. Any legal proceedings or regulatory matters that we or our Affiliates are subject to could, whether with or without merit, be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management attention and resources, and could result in judgments, findings, settlements or allegations of wrongdoing that could adversely affect our or their reputation, current and future business relationships, and our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur or our Affiliates\u2019 controls and procedures and risk management policies may be inadequate, fail or be circumvented, and operational risk could adversely affect our or our Affiliates\u2019 reputation and financial position.\nWe and our Affiliates have adopted various controls, procedures, policies, and systems to monitor and manage risk in our and their businesses. While we currently believe that our and our Affiliates\u2019 operational controls are effective, we cannot provide assurance that those controls, procedures, policies, and systems will always be adequate to identify and manage the internal and external risks in our and our Affiliates\u2019 various businesses. Furthermore, we or our Affiliates may have errors in business processes or fail to implement proper procedures in operating our respective businesses, which may expose us or our Affiliates to risk of financial loss or failure to comply with regulatory requirements. Additionally, although we and our Affiliates have systems and practices in place to monitor third-party service providers, such third parties are subject to similar risks. We and our Affiliates, as well as our respective service providers, are also subject to the risk that employees or contractors, or other third parties, may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with our or their controls, policies and procedures. The financial and reputational impact of control failures can be significant.\nIn addition, our and our Affiliates\u2019 businesses and the markets in which we and our Affiliates operate are continuously evolving. If our or our Affiliates\u2019 risk frameworks are ineffective, either because of a failure to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, regulatory requirements, our or our Affiliates\u2019 businesses, counterparties, clients, or service providers, or for other reasons, we or our Affiliates could incur losses, suffer reputational damage, or be out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations.\nFailure to maintain and properly safeguard an adequate technology infrastructure may limit our or our Affiliates\u2019 growth, result in losses or disrupt our or our Affiliates\u2019 businesses.\nOur and our Affiliates\u2019 businesses are reliant upon financial, accounting, and technology systems and networks to process, transmit, and store information, including sensitive client and proprietary information, and to conduct many business activities and transactions with clients, advisers, regulators, vendors, and other third parties. The failure to implement, maintain, and safeguard an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of our and our Affiliates\u2019 businesses could impede productivity and growth, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we and our Affiliates rely on third parties for certain aspects of our respective businesses, including financial intermediaries, providers of technology infrastructure, and other service providers such as broker-dealers, custodians, administrators and other agents, as well as accounting, legal and other professional advisors, and these parties are susceptible to similar risks.\nAlthough we and our Affiliates take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, computer systems, software, networks, and mobile devices may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data privacy or security breaches, ransomware, social engineering, unauthorized access, theft, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. Further, although we and our Affiliates have systems and practices in place to monitor the third parties on whom we and our Affiliates rely, such third parties may have similar vulnerabilities and may lack the necessary infrastructure or resources, or may otherwise fail, to adequately protect against or respond to any cyber-attacks, data breaches, or other incidents. If any such events occur, it could jeopardize confidential, proprietary, or other sensitive information of ours, our Affiliates and our respective clients, employees or counterparties that may be stored in, or transmitted through, internal or third-party computer systems, networks, and mobile devices, or could otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our and our Affiliates\u2019 operations or those of our respective clients or counterparties, or in the operations of third parties on whom we and our Affiliates rely. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of systems and networks, it is possible that we, our Affiliates or our respective third-party service providers may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all threats, especially because the techniques used change frequently and can originate from a wide variety of sources. The recent shift to work-from-home environments has increased exposures to these security-related risks. As a result, we or our Affiliates could experience disruption, significant losses, increased costs, reputational harm, regulatory actions, or legal liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We or our Affiliates may be required to spend significant additional resources to modify protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, and potential fines, and financial losses that are either not insured against fully or not fully covered through any insurance that we or our Affiliates maintain. Further, government and regulatory oversight of data privacy in particular has been growing in recent years, including through the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, resulting in heightened data security and handling requirements, increased fines, and expanded incident response and reporting obligations. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have exemplified security-related vulnerabilities, and may lead to further government and regulatory scrutiny and heightened security requirements.", "PERMNO": 85593, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "AMG"}
