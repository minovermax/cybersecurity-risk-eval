{"cik": "65011", "company": "MEREDITH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, investors should consider the following risk factors carefully when investing in our securities. In addition to the risks described below, there may be additional risks that we have not yet perceived or that we currently believe are immaterial.\nRisks Relating to Business Operations\nThe effects of the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operations, and prospects. The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home policies, supply chain logistical changes, and closure of non-essential businesses. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers, we have made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, implemented office closures as employees are advised to work from home, and canceled or shifted our marketing events to virtual-only.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities. There is substantial uncertainty as to the nature and degree of the continued effects of the pandemic over time. Our business, financial condition, operations, and prospects have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has adversely impacted our advertising and marketing partners, consumers, and the markets in which we operate.\nWhile the ultimate potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business, in particular, may be difficult to assess or predict, to date the pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruption of aspects of our business. For example, we have experienced advertising cancellations and delays across our business as well as declines in our newsstand sales, resulting in an adverse impact on our revenues. In addition, we may experience unfavorable impacts on our operations as a result of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nWe may in the future experience significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our products; if prolonged, such impacts may further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may negatively impact our results;\n\u2022\nWe may in the future experience significant reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as a result of retailers or shippers modifying restocking, fulfillment, and shipping practices;\n\u2022\nWe may in the future be unable to meet our customers\u2019 needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing operations or supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or finished product components, transportation resources, workforce availability, or other manufacturing and distribution capability;\n\u2022\nWe may in the future be unable to effectively manage evolving health and welfare strategies, including, but not limited to, ongoing or not yet fully known costs related to operational adjustments to ensure continued employee and consumer safety and adherence to health guidelines as they are modified and supplemented;\n\u2022\nWe may in the future be impacted by the failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who print our magazines, supply necessary operating materials, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may negatively impact our operations; and\n\u2022\nWe may in the future be impacted by significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures, or other restrictions that restrict our employees\u2019 ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could negatively impact our results.\nAs a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business to date and the continuing uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have paused our common and class B stock dividends, implemented a series of operational cost-control measures, including temporary reductions in Board of Director fees and employee and executive salaries, and have taken steps to significantly reduce capital expenditures and optimize working capital. We may need to take further actions to ensure the continuity of our business. In addition, due to market volatility and material declines in equity prices, we recorded material non-cash impairment charges related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, and FCC broadcast licenses.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals\u2019 actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending as well as customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management\u2019s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening other risks identified in this section of our Form 10-K.\nThe Company previously identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, which have now been remediated. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. The Company previously disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019, two material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. As a result of these control deficiencies, the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the year ended June 30, 2019. During fiscal 2020, the Company completed a series of actions and measures that remediated the previously disclosed material weaknesses and concluded that as of June 30, 2020, its internal control over financial reporting was effective. See Item 9A - Controls and Procedures of this Form 10-K.\nMaintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable consolidated financial statements. The Company cannot provide assurances that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future and that it will be able to remediate such weaknesses or deficiencies in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. The development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting and financial obligations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock, and/or result in litigation against us. In addition, even though we have strengthened our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements or our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nAdvertising related revenues represent the largest portion of our revenues, and advertising demand may fluctuate from period to period. In fiscal 2020, 49 percent of our revenues were derived from advertising related sources. Advertising related revenues constitute 48 percent of our national media revenues and 53 percent of our local media revenues. Demand for advertising is highly dependent upon the strength of the U.S. economy. During an economic downturn, demand for advertising may decrease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some of our advertising and marketing partners have faced tremendous challenges, which has impacted Meredith. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Meredith saw cancellations and delays in advertising campaigns, with significant declines in local television non-political advertising, digital advertising, and print advertising revenues. While the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues into fiscal 2021, we expect to continue to see cancellations and delays in advertising into at least early fiscal 2021, which could similarly reduce our net earnings. We do not know when advertising conditions will improve or return to historical levels. In addition, political advertising revenues are cyclical in that they are significantly greater during biennial election campaigns (which take place primarily in odd-numbered fiscal years) than at other times. The growth in alternative forms of media, particularly digital platforms, has increased the competition for advertising dollars, which could, in turn, reduce expenditures for magazine and television advertising or suppress advertising rates.\nCirculation revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues. Magazine circulation is another significant source of revenue, representing 27 percent of total revenues and 37 percent of national media revenues in fiscal 2020. Preserving the number of copies sold is critical for maintaining advertising sales. Magazines face increasing competition from alternative forms of media and entertainment. As a result, sales of magazines through subscriptions and at the newsstand could decline. As publishers compete for subscribers, subscription prices could decrease and marketing expenditures may increase. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, shelter-in-place and business closing orders as well as significant declines in travel have impacted Meredith. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Meredith saw reductions in newsstand sales. While the Company is not able to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenues into fiscal 2021, we expect to continue to see declines in newsstand sales into at least early fiscal 2021, which could similarly reduce our net earnings.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of alternative methods for the delivery of content and have driven consumer demand and expectations in unanticipated directions. If we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences,\nour business, financial condition, and prospects may be adversely affected. Technology developments also pose other challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. New delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, the loss of distribution control, and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers. For example, the largest broadcast television national networks have brought a copyright infringement lawsuit against Locast, an entity that claims to be a non-profit and claims to have found a loophole allowing for uncompensated online streaming of copyrighted television content. We may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on websites proliferates. In addition, technologies such as subscription streaming media services and mobile video are increasing competition for household audiences and advertisers. This competition may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our broadcasting and print revenues, which we believe may challenge us to expand the contribution of our digital businesses.\nOur websites and internal networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized persons accessing our systems, which could disrupt our operations. The Company uses computers and other technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations, and our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such increases expose us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Our website activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, which we strive to protect from unauthorized access. However, it is possible that unauthorized persons may be able to circumvent our protections and misappropriate proprietary information, corrupt data, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our digital operations. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, public disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences, and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. We invest in security resources and technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber-attack, but the techniques used to attempt attacks are continually changing. A breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.\nEvolving privacy and information security laws and regulations may impair our ability to market to consumers. Meredith\u2019s consumer database includes first-party data that is used to market our products to our customers. In select circumstances, we share this first-party data with advertising and marketing clients and partners. As public awareness increases and shifts to data gathering and usage, privacy rights, and data protection, new laws and regulations may be passed or existing laws and regulations may be amended in ways that would limit our collection and use of certain categories of data. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general continue to initiate investigations into the collection and use of consumer data, often with a focus on the advertising industry. These investigations could lead to new transparency requirements, consumer controls, and other restrictions, and require ongoing review of new technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that all new products and advertising services comply with all of the regulatory requirements imposed at the state, federal, and international level. In addition to the changing regulatory landscape, new privacy controls implemented by platforms such as Facebook, Google, and Apple will limit our ability to access and use data from consumers through those platforms, which we rely on for both digital advertising and mobile marketing.\nCurrently, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous, and sometimes conflicting, regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere. For example, the European Union (E.U.) adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018; and California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA), which became effective on January 1, 2020. These laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is processed. If we do not comply with our obligations under the GDPR, we could be exposed to fines and penalties, which under the GDPR could be as high as the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4 percent of our total global annual revenue in the event of a significant breach. In addition, we may be the subject of litigation or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Similarly, the CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation.\nAdditionally, legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer personal data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers. Specifically, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the E.U. invalidated Decision 2016/1250 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. We are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework but will not be able to rely on it in the future, which could increase our costs and limit our ability to process personal data from the E.U. The same decision also casts doubt on the ability to use one of the primary alternatives to the Privacy Shield, namely, the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses, to lawfully transfer personal data from Europe to the U.S. and most other countries. At present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the Privacy Shield and the Standard Contractual Clauses. Further, the U.K.\u2019s impending exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom (U.K.), including with respect to data transfers from the EEA to the U.K.\nCompliance with existing, proposed, and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under GDPR and CCPA) and regulations can be costly and time consuming, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. In addition, all 50 states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and (in some cases) government agencies when certain information has been accessed or acquired by an unauthorized party due to a security breach.\nMisuse of or failure to secure personal information could result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, imposition of fines by governmental authorities, and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nWorld events may result in unexpected adverse operating results for our local media segment. Our local media results have been and in the future could again be affected adversely by world events such as wars, political unrest, acts of terrorism, pandemics, and natural disasters. Such events can result in significant declines in advertising revenues as the stations will not broadcast or will limit broadcasting of commercials during times of crisis. In addition, our stations may have higher newsgathering costs related to coverage of the events.\nOur local media operations are subject to FCC regulation. Our broadcasting stations operate under licenses granted by the FCC. The FCC regulates many aspects of television station operations, including employment practices, political advertising, indecency and obscenity, programming, signal carriage, and various other technical matters. Violations of these regulations could result in penalties and fines. Changes in these regulations could impact the results of our operations. The FCC also regulates the ownership of television stations. Changes in the ownership rules could adversely affect our ability to consummate future transactions or may favor our competitors. Details regarding regulation and its impact on our local media operations are provided in Item 1 - Business beginning on page 10.\nLoss of or changes in affiliation agreements could adversely affect operating results for our local media segment. Further, our retransmission consent revenue may be adversely affected by renewals of retransmission consent agreements or by declines in the number of subscribers to multichannel video programming distributor (MVPD) services. Due to the quality of the programming provided by the networks, stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market. As a result, it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations. Most of our stations have network affiliation agreements. Seven are affiliated with CBS, five with FOX, two with MyNetworkTV, one with NBC, and one with ABC. These television networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each of our stations\u2019 commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during the programming. We also make cash payments to the networks. These payments are, in essence, a portion of the retransmission consent fees that Meredith receives from cable, satellite, and telecommunications service providers, which pay Meredith to carry our television programming in our markets. These network relationships may also include terms regarding over-the-top distribution. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation\nagreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the affiliate network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and/or which may not be as attractive to our audiences, resulting in reduced revenues.\nFurthermore, the loss of or material reduction in retransmission consent revenues or further change in the current retransmission consent regulations could adversely affect the economics of our relationship with the applicable network(s), advertising revenues, and our local brands. Specifically, our retransmission consent revenue may be adversely affected by renewals, non-renewals, or renewals on less favorable terms of retransmission consent agreements, declines in the number of subscribers to MVPD services, or by new technologies for the distribution of video programming. In recent years, the number of subscribers to MVPD services has declined as the growth of direct internet streaming of video programming to televisions and mobile devices has led consumers to discontinue their cable or satellite service subscriptions. As most retransmission consent agreements include payment terms by subscriber numbers, reductions in the number of MVPD subscribers reduces the revenue we earn under our retransmission agreements.\nIf renewed, our network affiliation agreements and our retransmission agreements may be renewed on terms that are less favorable to us. Our FOX affiliation agreements expire in July 2022. Our MyNetworkTV affiliation agreements expire in September 2022. Our NBC affiliation agreement expires in December 2021 and our ABC affiliation agreement expires in August 2023. Our CBS affiliation agreements expire in July 2023.\nClient relationships are important to our brand licensing and consumer relationship marketing businesses. Our ability to maintain existing client relationships and generate new clients depends significantly on the quality of our products and services, our reputation, and the continuity of Company and client personnel. Dissatisfaction with our products and services, damage to our reputation, or changes in key personnel could result in a loss of business.\nIncreases in paper and postage prices, which are difficult to predict and control, could adversely affect our results of operations. Paper and postage represent significant components of our total cost to produce, distribute, and market our printed products. In fiscal 2020, these expenses accounted for 14 percent of national media\u2019s operating costs. Paper is a commodity and its price can be subject to significant volatility. All our paper supply contracts currently provide for price adjustments based on prevailing market prices; however, we historically have been able to realize favorable paper pricing through volume discounts. The USPS distributes substantially all our subscription magazines and many of our marketing materials. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the USPS and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Although we work with others in the industry and through trade organizations to encourage the USPS to implement efficiencies that will minimize rate increases, we cannot predict with certainty the magnitude of future price changes for paper and postage. Further, we may not be able to pass such increases on to our customers.\nWe are currently reliant on a single supplier for printing of our magazines. All our magazine printing is performed by the only domestic supplier capable of producing the entirety of our work. Failure by such supplier to provide printing services to us, or any disruption in such services, may adversely impact our business. We may incur increased business disruption risk due to the dependence on a single supplier. If this supplier experienced business difficulties or failed to meet our printing needs, then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands, lose revenues, and be unable to maintain customer relationships. Longer production lead times and increased paper and postage costs may result if there is a need to move the printing to multiple other suppliers. Without such single supplier continuing to print our magazines, we may have no other means of producing our magazines until we are able to secure printing capabilities at multiple other facilities. This transition could be costly and time consuming.\nAcquisitions pose inherent financial and other risks and challenges. As a part of our strategic plan, we have acquired businesses and we expect to continue acquiring businesses in the future. These acquisitions can involve a number of risks and challenges, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability. Such risks and challenges include underperformance relative to our expectations and the price paid for the acquisition; unanticipated demands on our management and operational resources; difficulty\nin integrating personnel, operations, and systems; retention of customers of the combined businesses; assumption of contingent liabilities; and acquisition-related earnings charges. If our acquisitions are not successful, we may record impairment charges. Our ability to continue to make acquisitions will depend upon our success at identifying suitable targets, which requires substantial judgment in assessing their values, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability, as well as the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices and whether restrictions are imposed by regulations. Moreover, competition for certain types of acquisitions is significant, particularly in the fields of broadcast stations and digital media. Even if successfully negotiated, closed, and integrated, certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected return on investment targets.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets is possible, depending upon future operating results and the value of the Company\u2019s stock. Although the Company wrote down its goodwill and intangible assets by $301.4 million in fiscal 2020, $41.8 million in fiscal 2019, and $22.7 million in fiscal 2018, further impairment charges are possible. We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of every fiscal year and on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist. Factors that influence the evaluation include, among many things, the Company\u2019s stock price and expected future operating results. If the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is no longer deemed to be recoverable, a potentially material non-cash impairment charge could be incurred. At June 30, 2020, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $3.4 billion, or 61 percent of Meredith\u2019s total assets, with $2.6 billion in the national media segment and $0.8 billion in the local media segment. The review of goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company has two reporting units - national media and local media. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company determined that interim triggering events, including declines in the price of its stock and the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, required an interim evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment as of March 31, 2020. The impairment tests determined the carrying value of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the national media reporting unit exceeded their estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $252.7 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the national media reporting unit to its fair value. During fiscal 2020, the national media segment also recorded non-cash impairment charges of $26.4 million to partially impair certain trademarks and the local media segment recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $22.3 million to partially impair an FCC license. Changes in key assumptions about the economy or business prospects used to estimate fair value or other changes in market conditions could result in additional impairment charges. Although these charges would be non-cash in nature and would not affect the Company\u2019s operations or cash flow, they would reduce stockholders\u2019 equity and reported results of operations in the period charged. Additionally, as goodwill and intangible assets of the national media reporting unit were written down to their estimated fair values as of March 31, 2020, those amounts are more susceptible to risk of impairment if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we are currently and, in the future, may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business. We are currently involved in and may in the future become involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by clients, employees, suppliers, competitors, government agencies, or others. For example, on September 6, 2019, a shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, and its Chief Financial Officer, seeking to represent a class of shareholders who acquired securities of the Company between May 10, 2018, and September 4, 2019 (the New York Action). On September 12, 2019, a shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Financial Officer, and its Chairman of the Board seeking to represent a class of shareholders who acquired securities of the Company between January 31, 2018, and September 5, 2019 (the Iowa Action). Both complaints allege that the defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Both complaints assert claims under the federal securities laws and seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. On November 12, 2019, the plaintiff shareholder withdrew the New York Action, and the action has been dismissed. On November 25, 2019, the City of Plantation Police Officers Pension Fund was appointed to serve as lead plaintiff in the Iowa Action. On March 9, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint in the Iowa Action, now seeking to represent a class of shareholders who acquired securities of the Company between January 31, 2018, and\nSeptember 30, 2019. The defendants intend to vigorously oppose the Iowa Action. On June 22, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Iowa Action. Under the court\u2019s scheduling order, it appears likely the Company will receive a decision on the motion sometime in late 2020 or 2021. Until then, discovery is stayed. The results of any such litigation, including the aforementioned class action lawsuits, investigations, and other legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, damage our reputation, require significant amounts of management time, and divert significant resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have two classes of stock outstanding with different voting rights. We have two classes of stock outstanding: common stock and class B stock. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share and account for 44 percent of the voting power. Holders of class B stock are entitled to ten votes per share and account for the remaining 56 percent of the voting power. There are restrictions on who can own class B stock. Members of Meredith\u2019s founding family hold the majority of class B shares. Control by a limited number of holders may make the Company a less attractive takeover target, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This voting control also prevents other shareholders from exercising significant influence over certain of the Company\u2019s business decisions.\nAdverse changes in the equity markets or interest rates, changes in actuarial assumptions, and legislative or other regulatory actions could substantially increase our U.K. pension costs and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Through one of our U.K. subsidiaries acquired with the acquisition of Time, the Company sponsors the IPC Media Pension Scheme (the IPC Plan), a defined benefit pension plan that is closed both to new participants and to the future accrual of additional benefits for current participants. The majority of pensions in payment and deferred pensions in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension are increased annually in line with the increase in the retail price index up to a maximum of 5 percent. Concurrently with the acquisition of Time, the Company was substituted for Time as the guarantor of all obligations of the statutory employers under the IPC Plan.\nThe most recent triennial valuation of the IPC Plan under U.K. pension regulations was completed as of April 5, 2018. Under the assumptions used in such valuation, which are more conservative than the assumptions used to determine a pension plan\u2019s funded status in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), the IPC Plan was deemed to be underfunded at that time by approximately \u00a359 million.\nUnder the current deed of guarantee, the Company would be obligated to fund the IPC Plan\u2019s \u201cbuyout deficit\u201d (i.e., the amount that would be needed to purchase annuities to discharge the benefits under the plan) under certain circumstances. Specifically, the Company would be required to deposit the buyout deficit into escrow if its debt in excess of $50 million were not to be paid when due or were to come due prior to its stated maturity as a result of a default (a Major Debt Acceleration) or if a Covenant Breach were to occur (as described below). The Company would be permitted to recoup the escrowed funds under certain circumstances. However, if the Company, as the sponsor, was to become insolvent, or if a Major Debt Acceleration were to occur (without being promptly cured), any escrowed funds would be immediately contributed into the IPC Plan, and the Company would be obligated to immediately contribute into the IPC Plan any shortfall in the buyout deficit amount.\nIn connection with the completion of the sale of all issued shares of Time Inc. (UK) Ltd (TIUK) on March 15, 2018, and the substitution of another U.K. subsidiary of the Company as the sole sponsor under the IPC Plan, the deed of guarantee was amended to remove requirements to deposit the buyout deficit as a result of certain credit rating triggers. At the same time, the Company agreed that the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Company\u2019s initial $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.875 percent unsecured senior notes (2026 Unsecured Senior Notes) would guarantee the obligations of the Company under the IPC Plan on a pari passu basis with the obligations under the 2026 Unsecured Senior Notes. In addition, the Company agreed to incorporate the terms of certain covenants under the indenture governing the 2026 Unsecured Senior Notes into the amended deed of guarantee effective as of March 15, 2018. If a breach of such covenants by the Company or the subsidiary\nguarantors occurs (after certain notice and cure periods) (a Covenant Breach), the Company would be required to deposit the buyout deficit (less the amount of certain types of security in favor of the IPC Plan, currently provided in the form of a surety bond) into escrow as described above.\nIf the Company had been required to fund the buyout deficit on June 30, 2020, the amount would have been approximately \u00a393 million. The amount of the buyout deficit changes daily and is determined by many factors, including changes in the fair value of the IPC Plan assets and liabilities and interest rates.\nIt is possible that, following future valuations of the IPC Plan\u2019s assets and liabilities or following future discussions with the IPC Plan trustee, the annual funding obligation and/or the arrangements to ensure adequate funding for the IPC Plan will change. The future valuations under the IPC Plan can be affected by a number of assumptions and factors, including legislative changes; assumptions regarding interest rates, currency rates, inflation, mortality, and retirement rates; the investment strategy and performance of the IPC Plan assets; and (in certain limited circumstances) actions by the U.K. Pensions Regulator. Volatile economic conditions, including Brexit, could increase the risk that the funding requirements increase following the next triennial valuation. The U.K. Pensions Regulator also has powers under the Pensions Act 2004 to impose a contribution notice or a financial support direction on the Company (and other persons connected with the Company or the U.K. subsidiary which sponsors the IPC Plan) if, in the case of a contribution notice, the U.K. Pensions Regulator reasonably believes such person has been party to an act, or deliberate failure to act, intended to avoid pension liabilities or that is materially detrimental to the pension plan, or, in the case of a financial support direction, if a plan employer is a service company or insufficiently resourced and the Pensions Regulator considers it is reasonable to act against such a person. A significant increase in the funding requirements for the IPC Plan or in the calculated \u201cself-sufficiency deficit\u201d or the calculated \u201crisk-free self-sufficiency deficit\u201d could result in a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness and our ability to incur significant additional indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;\n\u2022\nexpose us to fluctuations in interest rates, to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nplace us at a potential disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\naffect our credit ratings.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on and be subject to our future financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. Our business may fail to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow funds in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments on our debt, to refinance our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we were unable to make payments on or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as asset sales, equity issuances, or negotiations with our lenders to\nrestructure the applicable debt. The terms of our debt agreements and market or business conditions may limit our ability to take some or all of these actions. In addition, if we incur additional debt, the related risks described above could be exacerbated.\nOur indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly or could prevent us from taking advantage of lower rates. A portion of our indebtedness consists of term loans and revolving credit facility borrowings with variable rates of interest that expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net earnings and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. Even if we enter into interest rate swaps in the future to reduce future interest rate volatility, we may not elect to maintain such interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. In addition, we have significant fixed-rate indebtedness that includes prepayment penalties, which could prevent us from taking advantage of any future decrease in interest rates that may otherwise be applicable to us.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. Our ability to generate such cash flow is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, issuing equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and investments. These actions, if necessary, may not be affected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at the applicable time. Any refinancing of our debt, if we are able to refinance our debt at all, could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Further, the credit agreement that governs the senior credit facilities, the indenture governing our initial $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.500 percent secured senior notes (2025 Secured Senior Notes), and the indenture governing the 2026 Unsecured Senior Notes (collectively the Senior Notes) restricts our ability to undertake, or use the proceeds from, such measures.\nOur ability to repay our indebtedness is largely dependent on the generation of cash flow by our operating subsidiaries and our operating subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make cash available to us by dividend, intercompany loans, advances, and other transactions, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to transfer cash to us to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.\nCovenants under the indentures governing our Senior Notes and our credit agreement may restrict our business and operations in many ways, and if we do not effectively manage our covenants, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. The indentures governing our Senior Notes and our credit agreement impose various covenants that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt, and make certain investments;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022\nprovide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022\nincur liens on assets;\n\u2022\nengage in certain asset sales, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate with, or sell all or substantially all our assets to another person;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ndesignate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nprohibit certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nThese covenants may:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the limitations and decreased flexibility on our business due to our significant debt obligations, we may not be able to capitalize on strategic opportunities or grow our business to the extent we would be able to without these limitations.\nOur failure to comply with any of the covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement or the indentures governing the Senior Notes, which could permit the administrative agent or the trustee, as applicable, or permit the lenders or the holders of the Senior Notes to cause the administrative agent or the trustee, as applicable, to declare all or part of any of our outstanding senior secured term loans or revolving loans or the Senior Notes to be immediately due and payable or to exercise any remedies provided to the administrative agent or the trustee, including, in the case of the credit agreement and the 2025 Secured Senior Notes, proceeding against the collateral granted to secure our obligations under the credit agreement and the 2025 Secured Senior Notes. An event of default under the credit agreement or the indentures governing the Senior Notes could also lead to an event of default under the terms of certain of our other agreements. Any such event of default or any exercise of rights and remedies by our creditors could seriously harm our business.\nDiscontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our variable rate debt. A substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate for deposits of U.S dollars (LIBOR). LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market, and general economic conditions. In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms, or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the U.S. or elsewhere. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Income Taxes\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. Our Company is subject to income taxes as well as non-income taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the amount of our tax liabilities, including those arising from potential changes in laws in the countries in which we\nhave a presence and the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws. Many judgments are required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by tax authorities, which often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. Any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate.\nIncreasingly, countries around the world are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations. In particular, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) significantly changed how corporations are taxed in the U.S., which has an ongoing impact on our provision for income taxes. While the Company\u2019s accounting for the effects of the Tax Act was completed in fiscal 2019, and the Company believes those effects have been appropriately recorded, various interpretive issues remain with respect to the Tax Act and additional regulatory guidance may be issued. Certain aspects of the Tax Act have been modified by subsequent legislation, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\nThe uncertainty in the application of the Tax Act and the CARES Act to our ongoing operations, as well as possible adverse future law changes attributable to changes in the U.S. political landscape, create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income taxes and could have an adverse impact on our future tax rate. Various Democratic Party proposals would partially or wholly reverse beneficial features of the Tax Act, such as by raising the U.S. corporate tax rate and increasing the tax on non-U.S. income. A change in party control of the White House and U.S. Senate thus could lead to dramatic changes in the tax law and result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. Increased federal and state fiscal spending to fund COVID-19 relief measures, coupled with a drop in tax revenue from pandemic-related reductions in economic activity, may add to the pressure to raise more tax revenue from federal and state corporate income and other taxes or to enact new types of taxes on businesses and their customers.\nThe Time business could have an indemnification obligation to Time Warner, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition. The complete legal and structural separation of Time Warner Inc.\u2019s (Time Warner) magazine publishing and related business from Time Warner (the Spin-Off) was completed by way of a pro rata dividend of Time Inc. shares held by Time Warner to its stockholders as of May 23, 2014, based on a distribution ratio of one share of Time Inc. common stock for every eight shares of Time Warner common stock held (the Distribution). If, due to any of Time Inc.\u2019s representations being untrue or Time Inc.\u2019s covenants being breached, it was determined that the Distribution did not qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, or that an excess loss account existed at the date of the Spin-Off, Time Inc. could be required to indemnify Time Warner for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe preceding risk factors should not be construed as a complete list of factors that\nmay affect our future operations and financial results.", "PERMNO": 42796, "SIC": 2721, "TIC": "MDP"}
