RISK FACTORS.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related To Our COMPANY\nWe have received an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm expressing substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm on our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The audit report states that our auditing firm has substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern due to the risk that we may not have sufficient cash and liquid assets at December 31, 2018 to cover our operating and capital requirements for the next twelve-month period; and if sufficient cash cannot be obtained, we would have to substantially alter, or possibly even discontinue, operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nManagement has developed a plan to continue operations. This plan includes continued control of expenses and obtaining equity or debt financing. Although we have successfully completed equity financings and reduced expenses in the past, we cannot assure you that our plans to address these matters in the future will be successful.\nThe factors described above could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, and may cause investors to have reservations about our long-term prospects, and may adversely affect our relationships with customers. There can be no assurance that our auditing firm will not issue the same opinion in the future. If we cannot successfully continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment.\nOur revenue is dependent upon acceptance of our products by the market. The failure of such acceptance will cause us to curtail or cease operations.\nOur revenue comes from the sale of our products. As a result, we will continue to incur operating losses until such time as sales of our products reach a mature level and we are able to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of our products to meet our operating expenses. There can be no assurance that customers will adopt our technology and products, or that businesses and prospective customers will agree to pay for our products. In the event that we are not able to significantly increase the number of customers that purchase our products, or if we are unable to charge the necessary prices, our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we fail to implement and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nWe concluded that as of December 31, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective. We have determined that we have limited resources for adequate personnel to prepare and file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within the required time periods and that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting exist relating to our accounting for complex equity transactions. If we are unable to implement and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner, or if we identify other material weaknesses in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements and public reports could be impaired, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We identified a lack of sufficient segregation of duties. Specifically, this material weakness is such that the design over these areas relies primarily on detective controls and could be strengthened by adding preventive controls to properly safeguard assets. In addition, investors may lose confidence in our reported information and the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe have a history of operating losses, anticipate future losses and may never be profitable.\nWe have experienced significant operating losses in each period since we began investing resources in PCT and CP. These losses have resulted principally from research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses associated with the development of our PCT business. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net loss available to common shareholders of $23,473,150 of which $12,881,899 was deemed dividends on a beneficial conversion feature, or ($15.33) per share, as compared with $10,715,561, or ($9.62) per share, of the corresponding period in 2017. We expect to continue to incur operating losses until sales of PCT and CP products increase substantially. We cannot be certain when, if ever, we will become profitable. Even if we were to become profitable, we might not be able to sustain such profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional financing, business operations will be harmed and if we do obtain additional financing then existing shareholders may suffer substantial dilution.\nWe need substantial capital to implement our sales distribution strategy for our current products and to develop and commercialize future products using our pressure cycling technology products and services in the sample preparation area, as well as for applications in other areas of life sciences. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf the problems, delays, expenses, and complications frequently encountered by early-stage companies;\n\u25cf market acceptance of our pressure cycling technology products and services for sample preparation;\n\u25cf the success of our sales and marketing programs; and\n\u25cf changes in economic, regulatory or competitive conditions in the markets we intend to serve.\nWe expect the net proceeds from an expected equity offering, along with our current cash position, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 36 months. Thereafter, unless we achieve profitability, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and to otherwise implement our overall business strategy. We currently do not have any contracts or commitments for additional financing. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to then existing shareholders.\nIf adequate funds are not available or if we fail to obtain acceptable additional financing, we may be required to:\n\u25cf severely limit or cease our operations or otherwise reduce planned expenditures and forego other business opportunities, which could harm our business;\n\u25cf obtain financing with terms that may have the effect of substantially diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our capital stock; or\n\u25cf obtain funds through arrangements with future collaboration partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some or all of our technologies or products.\nOur financial results depend on revenues from our pressure cycling technology products and services, and from government grants.\nWe currently rely on revenues from PCT, CP, and CS technology products and services in the sample preparation area and from revenues derived from grants awarded to us by governmental agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health. We have been unable to achieve market acceptance of our product offerings to the extent necessary to achieve significant revenue. Competition for government grants is very intense, and we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be awarded grants in the future. If we are unable to increase revenues from sales of our pressure cycling technology products and services and government grants, our business will fail.\nWe may be unable to obtain market acceptance of our pressure cycling technology products and services.\nMany of the initial sales of our pressure cycling technology products and services have been to our collaborators, following their use of our products in studies undertaken in sample preparation for genomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and small molecules studies. Later sales have been to key opinion leaders. Our technology requires scientists and researchers to adopt a method of sample extraction that is different from existing techniques. Our PCT sample preparation system is also more costly than most existing techniques. Our ability to obtain market acceptance will depend, in part, on our ability to demonstrate to our potential customers that the benefits and advantages of our technology outweigh the increased cost of our technology compared with existing methods of sample extraction. If we are unable to demonstrate the benefits and advantages of our products and technology as compared with existing technologies, we will not gain market acceptance and our business will fail.\nOur business may be harmed if we encounter problems, delays, expenses, and complications that often affect companies that have not achieved significant market acceptance.\nOur pressure cycling technology business continues to face challenges in achieving market acceptance. If we encounter problems, delays, expenses and complications, many of which may be beyond our control or may harm our business or prospects. These include:\n\u25cf availability of adequate financing;\n\u25cf unanticipated problems and costs relating to the development, testing, production, marketing, and sale of our products;\n\u25cf delays and costs associated with our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and\n\u25cf competition.\nThe sales cycle of our pressure cycling technology products is lengthy. We have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses and we may not generate any significant revenue related to those products.\nMany of our current and potential customers have required between three and six months or more to test and evaluate our pressure cycling technology products. This increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel its order or otherwise change its plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that potential customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expense related to customers from whom we have not yet generated any revenue from our products, and from whom we may never generate the anticipated revenue if a customer is not satisfied with the results of the evaluation of our products or if a customer cancels or changes its plans.\nOur business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects.\nWe are continuously developing new and improving our existing, pressure cycling technology products in sample preparation and we expect to do so in other areas of life sciences depending upon the availability of our resources. Newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects. In addition, these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications. If, despite internal testing and testing by our collaborators, any of our products contain errors or defects or fail to meet customer specifications, then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies. We may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at considerable expense. In addition, any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction, negative publicity or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects.\nOur success may depend on our ability to manage growth effectively.\nOur failure to manage growth effectively could harm our business and prospects. Given our limited resources and personnel, growth of our business could place significant strain on our management, information technology systems, sources of manufacturing capacity and other resources. To properly manage our growth, we may need to hire additional employees and identify new sources of manufacturing capabilities. Failure to effectively manage our growth could make it difficult to manufacture our products and fill orders, as well as lead to declines in product quality or increased costs, any of which would adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management, specifically our Chief Executive Officer, Richard T. Schumacher. The loss of the services of any of our senior management could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. In addition, our failure to retain existing engineering, research and development, operations, and marketing/sales personnel could harm our product development capabilities and customer and employee relationships, delay the growth of sales of our products, and result in the loss of key information, expertise, or know-how.\nWe may not be able to hire or retain the number of qualified personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, required for our business, which would harm the development and sales of our products and limit our ability to grow.\nCompetition in our industry for senior management, technical, sales, marketing, finance and other key personnel is intense. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and train additional qualified personnel, either because of competition in our industry for such personnel or because of insufficient financial resources, our growth may be limited. Our success also depends in particular on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified engineering and sales personnel with experience in design, development and sales of laboratory equipment.\nOur reliance on a single third party for all of our manufacturing, and certain of our engineering, and other related services could harm our business.\nWe currently solely rely on CBM Industries, a third party contract manufacturer, to manufacture our Barocycler 2320EXT instrumentation, provide manufacturing expertise, and manage the majority of our sub-contractor supplier relationships for this instrument. Because of our dependence on one manufacturer, our success will depend, in part, on the ability of CBM to manufacture our products cost effectively, in sufficient quantities to meet our customer demand, if and when such demand occurs, and meeting our quality requirements. If CBM experiences manufacturing problems or delays, or if CBM decides not to continue to provide us with these services, our business may be harmed. While we believe other contract manufacturers are available to address our manufacturing and engineering needs, if we find it necessary to replace CBM, there will be a disruption in our business and we would incur additional costs and delays that would harm our business.\nOur failure to manage current or future alliances or joint ventures effectively may harm our business.\nWe have entered into business relationships with four distribution partners and one co-marketing partner, and we may enter into additional alliances, joint ventures or other business relationships to further develop, market and sell our pressure cycling technology product line. We may not be able to:\n\u25cf identify appropriate candidates for alliances, joint ventures or other business relationships;\n\u25cf assure that any candidate for an alliance, joint venture or business relationship will provide us with the support anticipated;\n\u25cf successfully negotiate an alliance, joint venture or business relationship on terms that are advantageous to us; or\n\u25cf successfully manage any alliance or joint venture.\nFurthermore, any alliance, joint venture or other business relationship may divert management time and resources. Entering into a disadvantageous alliance, joint venture or business relationship, failing to manage an alliance, joint venture or business relationship effectively, or failing to comply with any obligations in connection therewith, could harm our business and prospects.\nWe may not be successful in growing our international sales.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will successfully develop our international sales channels to enable us to generate significant revenue from international sales. We currently have four international distribution agreements that cover 24 countries in Europe, Asia and Australia. We have generated limited sales to date from international sales and cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our sales. As we expand, our international operations may be subject to numerous risks and challenges, including:\n\u25cf multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including those that regulate high pressure equipment;\n\u25cf reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;\n\u25cf political and economic changes and disruptions;\n\u25cf export and import controls;\n\u25cf tariff regulations; and\n\u25cf currency fluctuations.\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly variation. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf our ability to increase our sales of our pressure cycling technology products for sample preparation on a consistent quarterly or annual basis;\n\u25cf the lengthy sales cycle for our products;\n\u25cf the product mix of the Barocycler\u00ae instruments we install in a given period, and whether the installations are completed pursuant to sales, rental or lease arrangements, and the average selling prices that we are able to command for our products;\n\u25cf our ability to manage our costs and expenses;\n\u25cf our ability to continue our research and development activities without incurring unexpected costs and expenses; and\n\u25cf our ability to comply with state and federal regulations without incurring unexpected costs and expenses.\nOur instrumentation operates at high pressures and may therefore become subject to certain regulations in the European Community. Regulation of high pressure equipment may limit or hinder our development and sale of future instrumentation.\nOur Barocycler\u00ae instruments operate at high pressures. If our Barocycler\u00ae instruments exceed certain pressure levels, our products may become subject to the European Pressure Equipment Directive, which requires certain pressure equipment meet certain quality and safety standards. We do not believe that we are subject to this directive because our Barocycler\u00ae instruments are currently below the threshold documented in the text of the directive. If our interpretation were to be challenged, we could incur significant costs defending the challenge, and we could face production and selling delays, all of which could harm our business.\nWe expect that we will be subject to regulation in the United States, such as by the Food and Drug Administration, and overseas, if and when we begin to invest more resources in the development and commercialization of PCT in applications outside of sample preparation for the research field.\nOur current pressure cycling technology products in the area of sample preparation for the research field are not regulated by the FDA. Certain applications in which we intend to develop and commercialize pressure cycling technology, such as protein purification, pathogen inactivation and immunodiagnostics, are expected to require regulatory approvals or clearances from regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, prior to commercialization, when we expand our commercialization activities outside of the research field. We expect that obtaining these approvals or clearances will require a significant investment of time and capital resources and there can be no assurance that such investments will receive approvals or clearances that would allow us to commercialize the technology for these applications.\nIf we are unable to protect our patents and other proprietary technology relating to our pressure cycling technology products, our business will be harmed.\nOur ability to further develop and successfully commercialize our products will depend, in part, on our ability to enforce our patents, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. To date, we have been granted 15 United States and foreign patents related to our PCT technology platform, and two additional patents in China related to our Ultra Shear Technology. We also received eight patents with our purchase of the assets of BaroFold in December 2017.\nThere can be no assurance that (a) any patent applications filed by us will result in issued patents; (b) patent protection will be secured for any particular technology; (c) any patents that have been or may be issued to us will be valid or enforceable; (d) any patents will provide meaningful protection to us; (e) others will not be able to design around our patents; and (f) our patents will provide a competitive advantage or have commercial value. The failure to obtain adequate patent protection would have a material adverse effect on us and may adversely affect our ability to enter into, or affect the terms of, any arrangement for the marketing or sale of any product.\nOur patents may be challenged by others.\nWe could incur substantial costs in patent proceedings, including interference proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and comparable proceedings before similar agencies in other countries, in connection with any claims that may arise in the future. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions about the patentability of our inventions and products, as well as about the enforceability, validity, or scope of protection afforded by the patents.\nIf we are unable to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge, others may develop technology and products that could prevent the successful commercialization of our products.\nWe rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information in our product development activities. To the extent we rely on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to maintain our competitive technological position, there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop the same or similar technologies. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and contractors. These agreements may not be sufficient to effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information and may not provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. If our employees, consultants, advisors, or contractors develop inventions or processes independently that may be applicable to our products, disputes may arise about ownership of proprietary rights to those inventions and processes. Such inventions and processes will not necessarily become our property but may remain the property of those persons or their employers. Protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, for any reason, could harm our business.\nIf we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business may be harmed.\nIt is possible that the manufacture, use or sale of our pressure cycling technology products or services may infringe patent or other intellectual property rights of others. We may be unable to avoid infringement of the patent or other intellectual property rights of others and may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action, or challenge the validity of the patents or other intellectual property rights in court. We may be unable to secure a license on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all. Also, we may not prevail in any patent or other intellectual property rights litigation. Patent or other intellectual property rights litigation is costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to bring any possible litigation related to such infringement to a successful conclusion. If we do not obtain a license under such patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we are found liable for infringement, or if we are unsuccessful in having such patents declared invalid, we may be liable for significant monetary damages, may encounter significant delays in successfully commercializing and developing our pressure cycling technology products, or may be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use, or sale of our pressure cycling technology products or services requiring such licenses.\nWe may be unable to adequately respond to rapid changes in technology and the development of new industry standards.\nThe introduction of products and services embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards may render our existing pressure cycling technology products and related services obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to adapt to change. We may be unable to allocate the funds necessary to improve our current products or introduce new products to address our customers\u2019 needs and respond to technological change. In the event that other companies develop more technologically advanced products, our competitive position relative to such companies would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully with others that are developing or have developed competitive technologies and products.\nA number of companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products that compete or will compete with our products. We compete with companies that have existing technologies for the extraction of nucleic acids, proteins and small molecules from cells and tissues, including but not limited to methods such as mortar and pestle, sonication, rotor-stator homogenization, French press, bead beating, freezer milling, enzymatic digestion, and chemical dissolution.\nWe are aware that there are additional companies pursuing new technologies with similar goals to the products developed or being developed by us. Some of the companies with which we now compete, or may compete in the future, have or may have more extensive research, marketing, and manufacturing capabilities, more experience in genomics and proteomics sample preparation, protein purification, pathogen inactivation, immunodiagnostics, and DNA sequencing and significantly greater technical, personnel and financial resources than we do, and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology to compete in an evolving industry. To compete, we must be able to demonstrate to potential customers that our products provide improved performance and capabilities. Our failure to compete successfully could harm our business and prospects.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization and may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe are a small company with a minimal number of employees. We expect to experience a period of expansion in headcount, facilities, infrastructure and overhead and anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth and market opportunities. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate new managers. Our future financial performance and its ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on its ability to manage any future growth effectively.\nProvisions in our articles of organization and bylaws may discourage or frustrate stockholders\u2019 attempts to remove or replace our current management.\nOur articles of organization and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult or discourage changes in our management that our stockholders may consider to be favorable. These provisions include:\n\u25cf a classified board of directors;\n\u25cf advance notice for stockholder nominations to the board of directors;\n\u25cf limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors; and\n\u25cf a provision that allows a majority of the directors to fill vacancies on the board of directors.\nThese provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts to make changes in our management that our stockholders consider to be beneficial and could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock.\nThe costs of compliance with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act, and with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, may place a strain on our limited resources and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns.\nAs a result of the regulatory requirements applicable to public companies, we incur legal, accounting, and other expenses that are significant in relation to the size of our Company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and OTC Markets Group, Inc., have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and may make some activities more time-consuming. These requirements have placed and will continue to place a strain on our systems and on our management and financial resources.\nCertain of our net deferred tax assets could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain of our net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) give rise to net deferred tax assets. Our ability to utilize NOLs and to offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d). In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by \u201c5 percent shareholders,\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such \u201c5 percent shareholders\u201d at any time over the preceding three years.\nAn ownership change under Section 382 of the Code would establish an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single taxable year to an amount equal to (i) the product of a specified rate, which is published by the U.S. Treasury, and the aggregate value of our outstanding stock plus; and (ii) the amount of unutilized limitation from prior years. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our NOLs. We may have or will have experienced an ownership change as defined by Section 382 through the sale of equity and, therefore, we will consider whether the sale of equity units will result in limitations of our net operating losses under Section 382 when we start to generate taxable income. However, whether a change in ownership occurs in the future is largely outside of our control, and there can be no assurance that such a change will not occur.\nSignificant policy shifts from the Trump Administration could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe Trump Administration has called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies, regulatory oversight of businesses, and greater restrictions on free trade including significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States, including from China. Proposals espoused by President Trump may result in changes to social, political, regulatory and economic conditions in the United States or in laws and policies affecting the development and investment in countries where we currently conduct business. In addition, these changes could result in negative sentiments towards the United States among non-U.S. customers and among non-U.S. employees or prospective employees. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business. It is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR SECURITIES\nThe holders of our Common Stock could suffer substantial dilution due to our corporate financing practices.\nThe holders of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution due to our corporate financing practices, which, in the past few years, have included private placements and a registered direct offering. As of December 31, 2018, we have issued shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, Series G Convertible Preferred Stock, Series H Convertible Preferred Stock, Series H2 Convertible Preferred Stock, Series J Convertible Preferred Stock, Series K Convertible Preferred Stock and Series AA Convertible Preferred Stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, all of the issued shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, and Series E Convertible Preferred Stock had been converted into shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2018, only shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, Series G Convertible Preferred Stock, Series H Convertible Preferred Stock, Series H2 Convertible Preferred Stock, Series J Convertible Preferred Stock, Series K Convertible Preferred Stock and Series AA Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding. Further, in connection with those private placements and the Series D registered direct offering, we issued warrants to purchase common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had issued notes and debentures convertible into common stock at $7.50 to $8.40 per common share. If all of the outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, Series G Convertible Preferred Stock, Series H Convertible Preferred Stock, Series H2 Convertible Preferred Stock, Series J Convertible Preferred Stock, Series K Convertible Preferred Stock and Series AA Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into shares of common stock and all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock were exercised and all fixed rate convertible notes and debentures were converted, each as of December 31, 2018, an additional 15,768,112 shares of common stock would be issued and outstanding. This additional issuance of shares of common stock would cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause a significant reduction in the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception of such possible sales, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, which include an offering of our preferred stock or common stock could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-related securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.\nOur share price could be volatile and our trading volume may fluctuate substantially.\nThe price of common stock has been and may in the future continue to be extremely volatile. Many factors could have a significant impact on the future price of our shares of common stock, including:\n\u25cf our inability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, whether through the issuance of equity securities or debt;\n\u25cf our failure to successfully implement our business objectives;\n\u25cf compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf market acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf technological innovations and new commercial products by our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in government regulations;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and other external factors;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results; and\n\u25cf the degree of trading liquidity in our shares of common stock.\nA decline in the price of our shares of common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely impact our ability to continue operations.\nThe relatively low price of our shares of common stock, and a decline in the price of our shares of common stock, could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because a significant portion of our operations has been and will continue to be financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our shares of common stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity and our operations. Such reductions and declines may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to continue our current operations. If the price for our shares of common stock declines, it may be more difficult to raise additional capital. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, and we are unable to generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations, we will not have the resources to continue our operations.\nThe market price for our shares of common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors. Any failure to meet these expectations, even if minor, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock.\nIf we issue additional securities in the future, it will likely result in the dilution of our shares of existing stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were 1,684,182 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Similarly, at such time, there were no shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock; Series A Convertible Preferred Stock; Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; Series C Convertible Preferred Stock; and Series E Convertible Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2018 there were 300 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding and convertible into 25,000 shares of common stock, 80,570 shares of Series G Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 26,857 shares of common stock, 10,000 shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 33,334 shares of common stock, 21 shares of Series H2 Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 70,000 shares of common stock, 3,458 shares of Series J Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 115,267 shares of common stock, 6,880 shares of Series K Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 229,334 shares of common stock and 6,499 shares of Series AA Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding convertible into 6,499,000 shares of common stock, .\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were outstanding options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 8,131,555 shares of common stock; and fixed rate convertible debt convertible into 637,765 shares of common stock. From time to time, we also may increase the number of shares available for issuance in connection with our equity compensation plan, we may adopt new equity compensation plans, and we may issue awards to our employees and others who provide services to us outside the terms of our equity compensation plans. Our board of directors may fix and determine the designations, rights, preferences or other variations of each class or series of preferred stock and may choose to issue some or all of such shares to provide additional financing in the future.\nThe issuance of any securities for acquisition, licensing or financing efforts, upon conversion of any preferred stock or exercise of warrants, pursuant to our equity compensation plans, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional securities, such issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change in control of our Company.\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common stock.\nFINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nOur Common Stock is subject to the \u201cPenny Stock\u201d rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:\n\u25cf That a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and\n\u25cf The broker or dealer receives from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\u25cf Obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and\n\u25cf Make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:\n\u25cf Sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u25cf That the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nWe have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nOur shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to certain rights, privileges and preferences over our common stock, including a preference upon a liquidation of our Company, which will reduce amounts available for distribution to the holders of our common stock.\nThe holders of our shares of Series D are entitled to payment, prior to payment to the holders of common stock in the event of liquidation of the Company. If we are dissolved, liquidated or wound up at a time when the Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive only an amount equal to the liquidation preference (as it may be adjusted from time to time), plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, to the extent that we have funds legally available. Any remaining assets will be distributable to holders of our other equity securities.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to amended Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months subject only to the current public information requirement. Affiliates may sell after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), current public information and notice requirements. Any substantial sales of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock. As result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe currently do not expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. In addition, in the future we may enter into agreements that prohibit or restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. As a result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit.\nWe could issue additional common stock, which might dilute the book value of our Common Stock.\nOur Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or a part of our authorized but unissued shares. Such stock issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium from the then-current trading price of our common stock. In addition, in order to raise capital, we may need to issue securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. These issuances would dilute the percentage ownership interest, which would have the effect of reducing your influence on matters on which our shareholders vote and might dilute the book value of our common stock. You may incur additional dilution if holders of stock warrants or options, whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted, exercise their options, or if warrant holders exercise their warrants to purchase shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 84056, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "PBIO"}
