{"cik": "1044777", "company": "OneSpan Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, which we consider the most significant, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, there are a number of less significant and other general risk factors that could affect our future results. If any of the events described in the risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We have grouped our Risk Factors under captions that we believe describe various categories of potential risk. For the reader\u2019s convenience, we have not duplicated risk factors that could be considered to be included in more than one category.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nWe are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in this Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures. We encourage our stockholders to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.\nRisks Related to our Business\n\u25cf While we believe the coronavirus could have a negative impact on our financial results in the future, the impact is difficult to assess at this time.\n\u25cf A significant portion of our sales are to a limited number of customers. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could have an adverse effect on revenues and profits.\n\u25cf The return of a worldwide recession and/or regional economic downturns may further impact our business.\n\u25cf Disruptions in markets or the European Union may affect our liquidity and capital resources.\n\u25cf We could incur substantial accounting related costs if we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting.\n\u25cf We have a long operating history, but only modest accumulated profit.\n\u25cf We derive revenue from a limited number of products.\n\u25cf The sales cycle for our products and technology is long, and we may incur substantial expenses for sales that do not occur when anticipated.\n\u25cf We have a great dependence on a limited number of suppliers and the loss of their manufacturing capability could materially impact our operations.\n\u25cf We order some hardware components, such as processors, in advance of expected use and often produce finished goods prior to the receipt of executed customer orders. If orders are not received, we could suffer losses related to inventory that cannot be sold at full value.\n\u25cf Our success depends on establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with other companies to distribute our technology and products and, in some cases, for us to incorporate their technology into our products and our products and services.\n\u25cf We may not be able to maintain effective product distribution channels, which could result in decreased revenue.\n\u25cf We depend on our key personnel for the success of our business and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business or could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.\n\u25cf If we fail to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.\n\u25cf Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u25cf Our worldwide income tax provisions and other tax accruals may be insufficient if any taxing authorities assume taxing positions that are contrary to our positions.\n\u25cf Changes in global tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u25cf Acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions present many risks, and failure to realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\u25cf Reported revenue may fluctuate widely due to the interpretation or application of accounting rules.\n\u25cf Provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\n\u25cf The evolution of our business requires more complex development and go-to-market strategies, which involve significant risk.\nRisks Related to the Market\n\u25cf We face significant competition and if we lose or fail to gain market share our financial results will suffer.\n\u25cf A decrease of average selling prices for our products and services could adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf We may need additional capital in the future and our failure to obtain capital would interfere with our growth strategy.\n\u25cf We experience variations in quarterly operating results and sales are subject to seasonality, both of which may result in a volatile stock price.\n\u25cf Our stock price may be volatile for reasons other than variations in our quarterly operating results.\n\u25cf Our stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock\n\u25cf A small group of persons control a substantial amount of our common stock and could delay or prevent a change of control.\n\u25cf Certain provisions of our charter and of Delaware law make a takeover of our Company more difficult.\n\u25cf Future issuances of blank check preferred stock may reduce voting power of common stock and may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control.\n\u25cf Our business could be adversely affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders.\nRisks Related to Technology and Intellectual Property\n\u25cf Technological changes occur rapidly in our industry and our development of new products is critical to maintain our revenue.\n\u25cf Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security incidents and other disruptions.\n\u25cf We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate portions of our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services or other vendors\u2019 material would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\n\u25cf Some of our products contain third-party, open-source software and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open-source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products or otherwise result in claims against us.\n\u25cf We must continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel for our research and development efforts.\n\u25cf We cannot be certain that our research and development activities will be successful.\n\u25cf Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could harm our business.\n\u25cf SaaS offerings, which involve various risks, constitute an important part of our business.\n\u25cf We depend significantly upon our proprietary technology and intellectual property and the loss of or successful challenge to our proprietary rights could require us to divert management attention and could reduce revenue and increase our operating costs.\n\u25cf Our patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.\n\u25cf We are subject to warranty and product liability risks.\n\u25cf There is significant government regulation of technology imports and exports and to the extent we cannot meet the requirements of the regulations we may be prohibited from exporting some of our products, which could negatively impact our revenue.\n\u25cf We employ cryptographic technology in our authentication products that uses complex mathematical formulations.\nRisks Related to International Operations\n\u25cf We face a number of risks associated with our international operations, any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue.\n\u25cf We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks, and improper management of that risk could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial conditions.\n\u25cf Changes in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\u25cf We must comply with governmental regulations setting environmental standards.\n\u25cf The vote by the United Kingdom (UK) to leave the European Union (EU) could adversely affect our financial results.\n\u25cf We or our suppliers may be impacted by new regulations related to climate change.\n\u25cf The effects of regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf U.S. investors may have difficulties in making claims for any breach of their rights as holders of shares because some of our assets and key employees are not located in the United States.\n\u25cf Our business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments increase the risks associated with our international activities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWhile we believe the coronavirus could have a negative impact on our financial results in the future, the impact is difficult to assess at this time.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was reported and in January 2020, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. A significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the broader economies, financial markets and overall demand environment for our products.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed our offices in March 2020 (including our corporate headquarters) in many countries except where we have been able to accommodate limited essential employees such as for the shipping of our hardware authentication tokens under revised procedures. We re-opened a limited number of our offices during the third and fourth quarter of 2020 with limited capacity under revised procedures. We are unable to predict further re-openings or whether the initial re-openings will be successful or remain in place. We implemented certain travel restrictions, remote work arrangements and other measures and while our early experience with this new situation has been satisfactory to date, it has disrupted how we normally operate our business and may in the longer term impact our productivity, innovation and effectiveness such that our results are adversely affected. We have shifted certain of our customer events to virtual-only experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. Because we operate in multiple international locations, we expect there to be variability and additional complications from differing conditions and inconsistent guidance from numerous public health agencies.\nIn our hardware business, we are exposed to specific risks related to manufacturing, supply chain, shipping and distribution- all of which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of COVID-19, we experienced some delays and increased costs related to fulfilling our hardware orders. Such issues have been primarily resolved however we may be unable to satisfy certain customer orders for our products in the future if orders substantially increase and/or supply chain problems emerge. In addition, the global economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-\n19 pandemic has affected many of our customers and we believe one of those effects has been decreased orders of hardware authentication tokens. We are not able to predict at this time whether and to what extent such orders may return or in what specific quantities. This risk is in addition to the other risks associated with our hardware business as stated elsewhere in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn our software business, we experienced some increased sales for products used in remote employee access and electronic signature in 2020 that we attribute in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. This increase may have been temporary, and we are unable to predict whether it will continue or decline. Moreover, the conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can affect the rate of IT spending, the decision to start new IT projects, the timing of existing projects and the priority our customers place on various projects. While these factors may be positive for some of our software solutions such as electronic signature, these factors may be negative for our other software solutions, such as risk analysis software. The COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our offerings, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, adversely impact our ability to provide on-site sales meetings or professional services to our customers, delay the provisioning of our offerings, lengthen payment terms, reduce the value or duration of their contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales, operating results and overall financial performance. During the Summer of 2020, we began to experience some of the aforementioned scenarios, and this continued through the remainder of 2020, due to, we believe, global economic uncertainty connected with the continued seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we hope that the negative consequences on our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will subside in 2021, we cannot predict the impact with certainty.\nIf the restrictions on our employees, customers and others in the world continue or increase in order to limit the spread of COVID-19, the potential effects could continue and could be exacerbated, and our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and vendors. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed.\nA significant portion of our sales are to a limited number of customers. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could have an adverse effect on revenues and profits.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, many of which are financial institutions. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could adversely affect our operations and results. In fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, our top 10 largest customers contributed 21%, 29%, and 24%, respectively, of total worldwide revenue.\nThe return of a worldwide recession and/or regional economic downturns may further impact our business.\nOur business is subject to economic conditions that may fluctuate in the major markets in which we operate. Factors that could cause economic conditions to fluctuate include, without limitation, recession, inflation, deflation, interest rates, unemployment, consumer debt levels, general retail or commercial markets and consumer or business purchasing power or preferences.\nIf global economic and financial market conditions remain uncertain and/or weak for an extended period of time, any of the following factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations:\n\u25cf slower consumer or business spending may result in reduced demand for our products and services, reduced orders from customers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, increased inventories, and lower gross margins;\n\u25cf continued volatility in the global markets and fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts or purchase orders in foreign currencies could negatively impact our reported financial results and condition;\n\u25cf continued volatility in the prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins, and ultimately our profitability;\n\u25cf restructurings, reorganizations, consolidations and other corporate events could affect our customers\u2019 budgets and buying cycles, particularly in the banking industry;\n\u25cf if our customers experience declining revenues, or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products and services, this could result in reduced orders, order cancellations, inability of customers to timely meet their payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense;\n\u25cf in the event of a contraction of our sales, dated inventory may result in a need for increased obsolescence reserves;\n\u25cf a severe financial difficulty experienced by our customers may cause them to become insolvent or cease business operations, which could reduce sales, cash collections and revenue streams.\n\u25cf any difficulty or inability on the part of manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain in obtaining sufficient financing to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.\nWe are unable to predict potential future economic conditions, disruptions in the sovereign debt markets or other financial markets, regional recessions, or the effect of any such disruption or disruptions on our business and results of operations, but the consequences may be materially adverse. We believe that our business in the Banking market in Europe would be impacted most directly by any such disruption and that the consequences may be materially adverse, as approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues originated in the EMEA region in 2020.\nDisruptions in markets or the European Union may affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe believe our financial resources are adequate to meet our operating needs. However, disruptions in the sovereign debt markets or other financial markets, the Euro Monetary Union or the European Union, could materially adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources and expose us to additional currency fluctuation risk. Sufficiently adverse effects could cause us to modify our business plans.\nFurthermore, in an adverse economic environment there is a risk that customers may delay their orders until the economic conditions improve further. If a significant number of orders are delayed for an indefinite period of time, our revenue and cash receipts may not be sufficient to meet the operating needs of the business. If this is the case, we may need to significantly reduce our workforce, sell certain of our assets, enter into strategic relationships or business combinations, discontinue some or all of our operations, or take other similar restructuring actions. While we expect that these actions would result in a reduction of recurring costs, they also may result in a reduction of recurring revenue and cash receipts. It is also likely that we would incur substantial non-recurring costs to implement one or more of these restructuring actions.\nWe could incur substantial accounting related costs if we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting.\nIn response to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting disclosed as of December 31, 2018, we expended significant resources to improve our internal control over financial reporting and the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. We expended significant resources, including accounting related costs and significant management oversight as we corrected the deficiencies. Management has determined that full remediation of the prior deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that led to this material weakness occurred, disclosed in Item 9A of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Investments will continue to be made to improve the control environment.\nWe cannot provide absolute assurance that additional material weaknesses, or significant deficiencies, in our internal controls will not be identified in the future. Failure to maintain effective controls or implement new or improved controls could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, affect management evaluations and auditor attestations regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls, failure to meet periodic reporting obligations, and material misstatements in our financial statements. Material misstatement of our financial statements may result in a restatement, loss of investor and customer confidence, a decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, and potential sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict the Company\u2019s future access to the capital markets.\nWe have a long operating history, but only modest accumulated profit.\nAlthough we have reported net income (loss) of $(5.5) million, $8.8 million, and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, our retained earnings were $173.7 million at December 31, 2020. Over our 25 year operating history, we have operated at a loss for many of those years. Depending on the economic environment\u2019s changing rules and regulations, and our investment strategies, it may be difficult for us to sustain profitability on a GAAP basis. We may choose to invest for long term value which could decrease or eliminate short term profit.\nWe derive revenue from a limited number of products.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sales of our legacy authentication hardware, software, and related services. We anticipate a substantial portion of future revenue, will be derived from authentication, products and related services. If the sale of these products and services is impeded for any reason and we have not diversified our offerings into more software, our business and results of operations would be negatively impacted. Further, we expect our hardware product sales to decline over the long term in our traditional markets. If the rate of decline is more than expected and the aforementioned diversification is not enough to offset the decline, our results could be uneven and overall could be negative.\nThe sales cycle for our products and technology is long, and we may incur substantial expenses for sales that do not occur when anticipated.\nThe sales cycle for our products, which is the period of time between the identification of a potential customer and completion of the sale, is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little control. If revenue falls significantly below anticipated levels, our business would be seriously harmed.\nA typical sales cycle in the financial services market is often six months or more. Larger banking transactions may take up to 18 months or more. Purchasing decisions for our products and services may be subject to delays due to many factors that are not within our control, such as:\n\u25cf Time required for a prospective customer to recognize the need for our products;\n\u25cf Significant expense of many security products and systems;\n\u25cf Customer budgeting process; and\n\u25cf Customer evaluation, testing and approval process.\nAs our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels, a small fluctuation in the timing of sales can cause our operating results to vary significantly between periods.\nWe have a great dependence on a limited number of suppliers and the loss of their manufacturing capability could materially impact our operations.\nIn the event that the supply of components or finished products is interrupted or relations with any of our principal vendors is terminated, there could be increased costs and considerable delay in finding suitable replacement sources to manufacture our hardware products. Our hardware Digipass authentication devices are assembled at facilities located in mainland China. The importation of these products from China exposes us to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the Chinese government, political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China or developments in the United States or European Union that are adverse to trade, including enactment of protectionist legislation. In 2019, a portion of our hardware products became subject to tariffs. If such tariffs increase in amount or scope, our financial results could be negatively affected. In part to address these risks of manufacturing in mainland China, in 2020 we launched an initiative to establish limited manaufacturing in the European Union. At this time, we do not know whether this project will be successful or how much this project could mitigate the risks related to Chinese manufacturing. Regardless of the location of manufacturing, we continue to be exposed to supply chain risks and uncertainties related to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe order some hardware components, such as processors, in advance of expected use and often produce finished goods prior to the receipt of executed customer orders. If orders are not received, we could suffer losses related to inventory that cannot be sold at full value.\nIn an attempt to minimize the risk of not having an adequate supply of component parts to meet demand and to take advantage of volume purchasing benefits, especially in situations where we have been notified that key processors will no longer be manufactured, we sometimes purchase multiple years\u2019 supply of parts based on internal forecasts of demand. In addition, to meet customers\u2019 demands for accelerated delivery of product, we sometimes produce finished product for existing customers before we receive the executed order from the customer. Should our forecasts of future demand be inaccurate or if we produce product that is never ordered, we could incur substantial losses related to the realization of our inventory.\nOur success depends on establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with other companies to distribute our technology and products and, in some cases, for us to incorporate their technology into our products and our products and services.\nPart of our business strategy is to enter into strategic alliances and other cooperative arrangements with other companies in our industry. We currently are involved in cooperative efforts with respect to the incorporation of our products into products of others and vice versa, research and development efforts, marketing efforts and reseller arrangements. These relationships are generally non-exclusive, and some of our strategic partners also have cooperative relationships with certain of our competitors. If we are unable to enter cooperative arrangements in the future or if we lose any of our current strategic or cooperative relationships, our business could be harmed. We do not control the time and resources devoted to such activities by parties with whom we have relationships. In addition, we may not have the resources available to satisfy expectations, which may adversely affect these relationships. These relationships may not continue, may not be commercially successful, or may require our expenditure of significant financial, personnel and administrative resources from time to time. Further, certain of our products and services compete with the products and services of our strategic partners.\nWe may not be able to maintain effective product distribution channels, which could result in decreased revenue.\nWe rely on both our direct sales force and an indirect channel distribution strategy for the sale and marketing of our products. We may be unable to attract distributors, resellers and integrators, as planned, that can market our products effectively and provide timely and cost-effective customer support and service. There is also a risk that some or all of our distributors, resellers or integrators may be acquired, may change their business models or may go out of business,\nany of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, our distributors, integrators and resellers may sell competing products. The loss of important sales personnel, distributors, integrators or resellers could adversely affect us.\nWe depend on our key personnel for the success of our business and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business or could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.\nOur success and our ability to manage our business depend, in large part, upon the efforts and continued service of our senior management team. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. It could be difficult for us to find replacements for our key personnel, as competition for such personnel is often intense. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets, which could reduce the market value of our securities.\nIf we fail to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel is often intense and there can be no assurance that we can attract other highly qualified personnel in the future. If we cannot retain or are unable to hire such key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the distribution of income among the various countries in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including the impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions, changes in share-based compensation expense, and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods; and a reduction in our U.S. tax rate could negatively impact our deferred tax assets which could also adversely impact our net income.\nOur worldwide income tax provisions and other tax accruals may be insufficient if any taxing authorities assume taxing positions that are contrary to our positions.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other taxes such as sales and VAT taxes. There are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany agreements to purchase intellectual properties, allocate revenue and costs, and other factors, each of which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable, we cannot be certain that the final tax authority review of these matters will not differ materially from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and other tax accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits, or other tax accruals, in the period in which such determination is made, and consequently, on our results of operations for such period.\nChanges in global tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in the jurisdictions where we operate. These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing these jurisdictions. For example, foreign jurisdictions could impose tax rate changes along with additional corporate tax provisions that would disallow or tax perceived \u201cbase erosion\u201d or profit shifting amongst jurisdictions. In addition, aspects of U.S. tax reform may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that results in an adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAcquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions present many risks, and failure to realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our products and platform, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses, operations technology and personnel; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; minimize potential losses of customers, business partners and key technical and managerial personnel; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks, including disruptions in our business because of the allocation of resources to consummate these transactions. Moreover, we might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our earnings.\nWith respect to acquisitions in particular, our failure to successfully structure or manage the transactions could seriously harm our financial condition or operating results. The expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized. In connection with our recent acquisitions and any future purchases, we could face additional financial and operational risks beyond those described above, including: dilution of our stockholders, if we issue equity to fund these transactions; reduced liquidity, increased debt and higher amortization expenses; assumption of operating losses, increased expenses and liabilities; discovery of unanticipated issues and liabilities; failure to meet expected returns; and difficulty in maintaining financial reporting and internal control processes needed to be compliant with requirements applicable to companies subject to SEC reporting.\nWe also regularly review our portfolio for contributions to our objectives and alignment with our strategy, and we may pursue divestiture activities as a result of these reviews. However, we may not be successful in separating any underperforming or non-strategic assets, and gains or losses on any divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may adversely affect our results of operations. Divestitures could also expose us to unanticipated liabilities or result in ongoing obligations, including transition service obligations and indemnity obligations.\nReported revenue may fluctuate widely due to the interpretation or application of accounting rules.\nOur sales arrangements often include multiple elements, including hardware, services, software, maintenance and support. In addition, we have sold software related arrangements in multiple forms, including perpetual licenses, term-based licenses and SaaS subscriptions, each of which may be treated differently under accounting rules. The accounting rules for such arrangements are complex and subject to change from time to time. The nature of the arrangement can create variations in the timing of revenue recognition.\nProvisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers, solution partners and channel partners generally include provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement and, in some cases, for damages caused by us to property or persons or for other damages. In addition, we make certain representations and warranties and incur obligations under our contracts in the ordinary course of business, including for items related to data security and potential data privacy breaches. Not all of our potential losses under our contracts are covered by insurance policies, which could increase the impact of any such loss should it occur. Large\nindemnity payments or damages resulting from our contractual obligations could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe evolution of our business requires more complex development and go-to-market strategies, which involve significant risk.\nOur increasing focus on developing and marketing a platform of solutions for identity management, authentication, risk analysis, fraud detection, digital business processes and related areas requires different development and go-to-market strategies than our historic hardware authentication business. We are developing, buying and licensing technology weighted toward software solutions and investment in research, development, product management, sales training and senior management. This transformation strategy is currently in progress and brings with it significant risks related to our choice of solutions and our ability to execute the strategy successfully. This strategy requires a greater focus on marketing and selling product suites and software solutions rather than selling hardware products for authentication and transaction signing. Consequently, we are developing, and must continue to develop, new strategies for marketing and selling our offerings. In addition, marketing and selling new solutions to enterprises requires significant investment of time and resources in order to train our employees and educate our customers on the benefits of our new product offerings. These investments can be costly and the additional effort required to educate both customers and our own sales force can distract from efforts to sell existing products and services.\nRisks Related to the Market\nWe face significant competition and if we lose or fail to gain market share our financial results will suffer.\nThe market for security products and services is highly competitive. Our competitors include organizations that provide security products based upon approaches similar to and different from those that we employ. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products.\nA decrease of average selling prices for our products and services could adversely affect our business.\nThe average selling prices for our solution offerings may decline as a result of competitive pricing pressures or a change in our mix of products, software and services. In addition, competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Furthermore, we anticipate that the average selling prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles. To maintain or realize our revenue and gross margins, we must continue to develop, or purchase and introduce new products and services that incorporate new technologies or increased functionality. If we experience such pricing pressures or fail to deliver new products and services relevant to our markets, our revenue and gross margins could decline, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and our failure to obtain capital would interfere with our growth strategy.\nOur ability to obtain financing will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor or creditor interest. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of any financing unattractive. They may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments, defer our product development activities, or delay the introduction of new products.\nWe experience variations in quarterly operating results and sales are subject to seasonality, both of which may result in a volatile stock price.\nIn the future, as in the past, our quarterly operating results may vary significantly, resulting in a volatile stock price. Factors affecting our operating results include:\n\u25cf The level of competition;\n\u25cf The size, timing, cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders;\n\u25cf New product announcements or introductions by competitors;\n\u25cf Technological changes in the market for security products including the adoption of new technologies and standards;\n\u25cf Changes in pricing by competitors;\n\u25cf Our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and product enhancements on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u25cf Component costs and availability;\n\u25cf Achievement of significant market share in particular markets followed by declines as buying cycles may be multiple years apart;\n\u25cf The variability of revenue realized from individual customers as their buying patterns can vary significantly from period to period and is affected by the individual solutions purchased and the structure of the contract;\n\u25cf Our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs;\n\u25cf Market acceptance of new products and product enhancements;\n\u25cf Changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u25cf General economic conditions in the countries in which we operate.\nWe also experience seasonality or variation across the year in our markets. These trends can include the summer months, particularly in Europe, or the second half of the fiscal year is generally higher than the first half in terms of sales.\nOur stock price may be volatile for reasons other than variations in our quarterly operating results.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf Differences between actual operating results and results estimated by analysts that follow our stock and provide estimates of our results to the market;\n\u25cf Differences between guidance relative to financial results, if given, and actual results;\n\u25cf Changes in market valuations of other technology companies, and cybersecurity companies in particular;\n\u25cf Investor acceptance of our strategies and the perception of our success in executing those strategies;\n\u25cf Announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf Additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf Future sales of common stock;\n\u25cf The inclusion or exclusion of our stock in ETF\u2019s, indices and other benchmarks, and changes made to methodologies connected therewith;\n\u25cf Trading volume fluctuations; and\n\u25cf Reactions by investors to uncertainties in the world economy and financial markets.\nOur stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock\nOn June 10, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (\u201cprogram\u201d). Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, at prices that the Company deems appropriate and subject to market conditions, applicable law and other factors deemed relevant in the Company\u2019s sole discretion, up to an aggregate purchase price of $50.0 million. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market conditions. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock. The authorization is effective until June 10, 2022. Repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nA small group of persons control a substantial amount of our common stock and could delay or prevent a change of control.\nMr. T. Kendall Hunt, our founder and former Chairman of the Board, beneficially owns approximately 12% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, Blackrock, Inc. holds approximately 12% of ownership, Legion Partners Asset Management holds approximately 7% of ownership, The Vanguard Group holds approximately 6% of ownership, Legal & General Investment Management LTD holds approximately 5% of ownership, and Sylebra Capital LTD holds approximately 5% of ownership.\nThe concentration of ownership may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control and may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our charter and of Delaware law make a takeover of our Company more difficult.\nOur corporate charter and Delaware law contain provisions, such as a class of authorized but unissued preferred stock which may be issued by our board without stockholder approval that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our Company. Delaware law also limits business combinations with interested stockholders. These\nprovisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or a change in our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nFuture issuances of blank check preferred stock may reduce voting power of common stock and may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control.\nOur corporate charter authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, rights, powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors, including such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors without further stockholder approval. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. In addition, the authorized shares of preferred stock and common stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control.\nOur business could be adversely affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders.\nAlthough we strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of our stockholders, and welcome their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all of our stockholders, our stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control of the Company. Campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategy.\nAny perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy or changes to the composition of our Board of Directors or senior management team arising from proposals by activist stockholders or a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability that may be exploited by our competitors and/or other activist stockholders, result in the loss of potential business opportunities, result in the loss of our employees and business partners and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, actual or perceived actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the Company\u2019s underlying fundamentals and prospects.\nRisks Related to Technology and Intellectual Property\nTechnological changes occur rapidly in our industry and our development of new products is critical to maintain our revenue.\nThe introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Our future revenue growth and operating profit will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our current products and develop innovative new solutions to distinguish us from the competition and to meet customers\u2019 changing needs. Security-related product developments and technology innovations by others may adversely affect our competitive position and we may not successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology, industry standards or customer requirements on a timely basis.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber security incidents and other disruptions.\nOur use of technology is increasing and is critical in at least three primary areas of our business:\n1.Software and information systems that we use to help us run our business more efficiently and cost effectively, which are increasingly cloud-based tools;\n2.The products we have traditionally sold and continue to sell to our customers contain technology that incorporates the use of secret numbers and encryption technology; and\n3.Solutions delivered on a software-as-a-service basis, from both public and private cloud models, which may process and store confidential, personal, health and financial information and which may rely on third parties for some or all of the solution.\nA cyber incident in any of these areas of our business could disrupt our ability to take orders or deliver products or services to our customers, cause us to suffer significant monetary and other losses and significant reputational harm, or substantially impair our ability to grow the business. We expect that there will continue to be hacking attempts intended to capture business information or exploit computing power to impede the performance of our products, to access our customers\u2019 information, or harm our reputation as a company. The processes used by hackers to access or sabotage technology products, services and networks are evolving in sophistication and increasing in frequency. We could experience a security incident due to various causes including intentional or unintentional conduct of our employees, vendors, technology partners and others that have access to or store our information.\nIn July 2011, we discovered a cyber-incident related to DigiNotar B.V. shortly after we purchased the company. The hacking incident at DigiNotar B.V. led to the termination of DigiNotar B.V\u2019s registration as a certification service provider and DigiNotar B.V.\u2019s bankruptcy. Since that time, we have experienced several security incidents, although none have been material. Even though we have established teams, processes and strategies to protect our corporate and solution assets, we may incur losses from such events as a result of unanticipated costs associated with data security incidents.\nIn addition, because we are in the cyber security industry, we could be targeted by hackers more than other companies and if a material cyber security breach occurred related to corporate or customer information, the reputational harm and potential lost future business could be greater than other companies not in our industry. We have taken various measures to strengthen the security of our products and our systems, to establish information security governance procedures and to train our employees. However, we are the subject of a large volume of hacking attempts and our defenses might not always be effective. If a hacking attempt were to be successful and lead to a material data breach, then it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, both in the current period and for a significant future period of time.\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate portions of our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services or other vendors\u2019 material would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\nWe outsource portions of our cloud infrastructure to Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Customers of our products need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. AWS runs its own platform that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to service interruptions at AWS. We have experienced and expect that in the future we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. Capacity constraints could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks. In addition, if our security, or that of AWS, is compromised, our products or platform are unavailable or our users are unable to use our products within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our platform\nperformance, especially during peak usage times, as our products become more complex and the usage of our products increases. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, either through AWS or alternative providers of cloud infrastructure, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, any changes in service levels from AWS may adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' requirements.\nAny of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, possibly move customers to stop using our products, impair our ability to increase revenue from existing customers, impair our ability to grow our customer base, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements and otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. These risks are also present with our other cloud service infrastructure vendors beside AWS. In addition, we also utilize strategic vendors to resell or incorporate third party technology and if these material vendors experienced a data breach, outage in service or other failure, we could be prevented from meeting our customers\u2019 requirements.\nSome of our products contain third-party, open-source software and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open-source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products or otherwise result in claims against us.\nOur products are distributed with software programs licensed to us by third-party authors under open-source licenses, which may include the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser Public License, the BSD License and the Apache License. Third-party, open-source programs are typically licensed to us for no fee and the underlying license agreements could require us to make available to users the source code for such programs, as well as the source code for any modifications or derivative works we create based on these third-party, open-source software programs.\nWe do not provide end users a copy of the source code to our proprietary software because we believe that the manner in which our proprietary software is aligned or communicates with the relevant open-source programs does not create a modification, derivative work or extended version of, or a work based on, that open-source program requiring the distribution of our proprietary source code.\nOur ability to commercialize our products by incorporating third-party, open-source software may be restricted because, among other reasons:\n\u25cf the terms of open-source license agreements are unclear and subject to varying interpretations, which could result in unforeseen obligations regarding our proprietary products or claims of infringement;\n\u25cf it may be difficult to determine the developers of open-source software and whether such licensed software infringes another party\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf competitors may have equal access to these open source products, which may help them develop competitive products; and\n\u25cf open-source software potentially increases customer support costs because licensees can modify the software and potentially introduce errors, which could also increase the risk of vulnerabilities available to hackers.\nWe must continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel for our research and development efforts.\nThe market for highly skilled technical talent is highly competitive. If we fail to attract, train, assimilate and retain qualified technical personnel for our research and development and product management efforts, we will experience delays or failures in introductions of new or modified products, and services, failures in adequate analysis of technology or acquisitions in the market, loss of clients and market share and a reduction in revenue.\nWe cannot be certain that our research and development activities will be successful.\nWhile management is committed to enhancing our current product offerings and introducing new products, we cannot be certain our research and development activities will be successful. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient financial resources to identify and develop new technologies and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner, and we cannot ensure that any such products will be commercially successful.\nFailure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could harm our business.\nAs part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, we periodically inform customers that products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches. Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nSaaS offerings, which involve various risks, constitute an important part of our business.\nAs we continue to acquire, develop and offer SaaS versions of products, we will need to continue to evolve our processes to meet a number of regulatory, intellectual property, contractual and service compliance challenges. These challenges include compliance with licenses for open source and third party software embedded in our SaaS offerings, maintaining compliance with export control and privacy regulations, including HIPAA and GDPR, protecting our services from external threats, maintaining continuous service levels and data security expected by our customers, preventing inappropriate use of our services and adapting our go-to-market efforts. In addition to using our internal resources, we also utilize third party resources to deliver SaaS offerings, such as third party data hosting vendors. The failure of a third party provider to prevent service disruptions, data losses or security breaches may require us to issue credits or refunds or indemnify or otherwise be liable to customers or third parties for damages that may occur. Additionally, if these third-party providers fail to deliver on their obligations, our reputation could be damaged, our customers could lose confidence in us and our ability to maintain and expand our SaaS offerings. Finally, our SaaS offerings need to be designed to operate at significant transaction volumes. When combined with third party software and hosting infrastructure, our SaaS offerings may not perform as designed which could lead to service disruptions and associated damages.\nWe depend significantly upon our proprietary technology and intellectual property and the loss of or successful challenge to our proprietary rights could require us to divert management attention and could reduce revenue and increase our operating costs.\nFrom time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow. In addition, former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments, redesign our products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations with our customers. Royalty or licensing arrangements we may seek in such circumstances may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to establish our intellectual property rights and to investigate, defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk. In addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. These third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or our inability to use any of this third party software or technology, could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although our\nemployees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. We may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be adversely affected. In the course of conducting our business, we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us or our customers. Our contracts generally indemnify our customers for third-party claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide. In the past, we have resolved several claims of patent infringement brought against us and a claim brought against a customer related to our technology. None of these claims were material to our financial results but this may not always be the case. The expense of defending these claims may adversely affect our financial results and may not be covered by any insurance policies we maintain. In addition, any such disputes and litigation could divert management attention and harm our reputation in the market.\nOur patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.\nWe hold numerous patents in the United States and in other countries, which cover multiple aspects of our technology. A substantial part of our patents cover the Digipass product line. Our patents expire between now and more than 10 years from now. There can be no assurance that we will continue to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that patents of others will not hinder our competitive advantage. Although certain of our technologies are patented, there are other organizations that offer products with comparable functionality that employ different technological solutions and compete with us for market share.\nWe are subject to warranty and product liability risks.\nA malfunction of or design defect in our products which results in a breach of a legal obligation or physical harm or damage from our products could result in tort or warranty claims against us. We seek to reduce the risk of these losses by using qualified engineers in the design, manufacturing and testing of our hardware products, proper development and testing of our software solutions, attempting to negotiate warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our sales agreements, and maintaining customary insurance coverage. However, these measures may ultimately prove ineffective in limiting our liability for damages.\nIn addition to any monetary liability for the failure of our products, an actual or perceived breach of network or security at one of our customers or publicly known defect or perceived defect in our products could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products, and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the demand for our products. Similarly, an actual or perceived breach of security within our own systems could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on the demand for our products.\nThere is significant government regulation of technology imports and exports and to the extent we cannot meet the requirements of the regulations we may be prohibited from exporting some of our products, which could negatively impact our revenue.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to risks such as the imposition of government controls, new or changed export license requirements, restrictions on the export of critical technology, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis our business may be impacted. Certain of our products are subject to export controls under U.S. law. The list of products and countries for which export approval is required, and the regulatory policies with respect thereto, may be revised from time to time and our inability to obtain required approvals under these regulations could materially and adversely affect our ability to make international sales. Violations of export control and international trade laws could result in penalties, fines, adverse reputational consequences, and other materially adverse consequences. In the past, we voluntarily disclosed a trade control matter to the U.S. government. Although this matter was closed during 2018 with no fines, penalties, or finding of wrongdoing, we cannot guarantee that such issues will not arise in the future. In addition, we cannot predict the future government regulation of aspects of our business and such regulation could be detrimental to our results.\nWe employ cryptographic technology in our authentication products that uses complex mathematical formulations.\nA portion of our products are based on cryptographic technology. With cryptographic technology, a user is given a key that is required to encrypt and decode messages. The security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user\u2019s key and in part on the application of algorithms, which are advanced mathematical factoring equations. These codes may eventually be broken or become subject to government regulation regarding their use, which would render our technology and products less effective. The occurrence of any one of the following could result in a decline in demand for our technology and products:\n\u25cf Any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems, including the development of an easy factoring method or faster, more powerful computers;\n\u25cf Publicity of the successful decoding of cryptographic messages or the misappropriation of keys; and\n\u25cf Increased government regulation limiting the use, scope or strength of cryptography.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nWe face a number of risks associated with our international operations, any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue.\nIn 2020, approximately 88% of our revenue and approximately 73% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2019, approximately 89% of our revenue and approximately 72% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2018, approximately 91% of our revenue and approximately 71% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. A severe economic decline in any of our major foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to exposures to changes in the economic conditions of our major foreign markets, we are subject to a number of risks any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue. These include:\n\u25cf Inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf Export controls relating to our technology;\n\u25cf Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations, including maintaining internal controls and closing or restructuring such operations;\n\u25cf Potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u25cf Wage and price controls or protection;\n\u25cf Uncertain protection for intellectual property rights, contractual rights and collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf Imposition of trade barriers;\n\u25cf Differing technology standards;\n\u25cf Uncertain demand for our solutions in individual countries, even if there were past sales;\n\u25cf Linguistic and cultural differences;\n\u25cf A widely distributed workforce;\n\u25cf Difficulty in providing support and training to customers in certain international locations;\n\u25cf Economic and political instability, including uncertainties in market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf Social unrest, health crises, and cultural barriers or changes.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks, and improper management of that risk could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial conditions.\nBecause a significant number of our principal customers are located outside the United States, we expect that international sales will continue to generate a significant portion of our total revenue. We are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations and risks because the majority of our product costs are denominated in U.S. Dollars, whereas a significant portion of the sales and expenses of our foreign operating subsidiaries are denominated in various foreign currencies. A decrease in the value of any of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect our revenue and profitability in U.S. Dollars of our products sold in these markets. We do not currently hold forward exchange contracts to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. Dollars to offset currency rate fluctuations.\nChanges in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIn Europe, we are subject to the 1995 European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Directive on Data Protection (\u201c1995 Data Protection Directive\u201d), which requires EU member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. The EU member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. In addition, certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards. The Company addressed these requirements by certification to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Frameworks prior to such Frameworks being invalidated in October 2015 by the European Court of Justice. The General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive effective May 25, 2018, creating significant impacts on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of EU individuals. We have expended significant resources to comply, but those methods may be subject to scrutiny by data protection authorities in EU member states. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit our use of personal data and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe must comply with governmental regulations setting environmental standards.\nGovernmental regulations setting environmental standards influence the design, components or operation of our products. New regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and, in some jurisdictions, regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may prevent us from selling our products in a certain country. In addition, these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components. In these cases, we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products, or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance. This could have an adverse effect on our revenues, gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results.\nWe are subject to the Restriction on the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC (also known as the \u201cRoHS Directive\u201d) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (also known as the \u201cWEEE Directive\u201d).\nThese directives restrict the distribution of products containing certain substances, including lead, within applicable geographies and require a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances.\nThese directives affect the worldwide electronics and electronics components industries as a whole. If we or our customers fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could incur liabilities and fines and our operations could be suspended.\nThe vote by the United Kingdom (UK) to leave the European Union (EU) could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn June 2016, UK voters approved a referendum to withdraw the UK's membership from the EU, which is commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". We have operations in the UK and the EU, and as a result, we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and disruptions that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and potential material changes to the regulatory regime applicable to our operations in the UK. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate or that may evolve over time, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe or our suppliers may be impacted by new regulations related to climate change.\nIn addition to the European environmental regulations noted above, we or our suppliers may become subject to new laws enacted with regards to climate change. In the event that new laws are enacted or current laws are modified in countries in which we or our suppliers operate, our flow of product may be impacted and/or the costs of handling the potential waste associated with our products may increase dramatically, either of which could result in a significant negative impact on our ability to operate or operate profitably.\nThe effects of regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals and derivatives (collectively \u201cConflict Minerals\u201d) which may originate from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (collectively, \u201cCovered Countries\u201d). As a result, in August 2012 the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for companies using Conflict Minerals in their products, including products manufactured by third parties. Like many electronic devices, our hardware products contain Conflict Minerals and are subject to the disclosure and reporting requirements. Compliance with these rules also requires due diligence including country of origin inquiries to determine the sources of Conflict Minerals used in our products.\nAs required, we filed our annual reports related to products manufactured. We reported that we determined we had no reason to believe Conflict Minerals used in our products may have originated in Covered Countries.\nWe may incur continued costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements. These requirements may affect pricing, sourcing and availability of Conflict Minerals used to produce our devices. We may be unable to verify the origin of all Conflict Minerals in our products. We may encounter challenges with customers and stakeholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free.\nU.S. investors may have difficulties in making claims for any breach of their rights as holders of shares because some of our assets and key employees are not located in the United States.\nSeveral of our key employees are full-time or part-time residents of foreign countries, and a substantial portion of our assets and those of some of our key employees are located in foreign countries. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on those persons located in foreign countries, or to enforce judgments against some of our key employees based upon the securities or other laws of jurisdictions in those foreign countries.\nOur business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments increase the risks associated with our international activities.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
