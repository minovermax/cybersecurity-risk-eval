{"cik": "91928", "company": "SOUTH JERSEY INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSJI and its subsidiaries operate in an environment that involves risks, many of which are beyond our control. SJI has identified the following risk factors that could cause SJI's operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected. In addition, new risks may emerge at any time, and SJI cannot predict those risks or the extent to which they may affect SJI's businesses or financial performance.\n\u2022\nSJI is a holding company and its assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries. Should SJI's subsidiaries be unable to pay dividends or make other payments to SJI for financial, regulatory, legal or other reasons, SJI's ability to pay dividends on its common stock could be limited. SJI's stock price could be adversely affected as a result.\n\u2022\nSJI's business activities are concentrated in southern New Jersey. Changes in the economies of southern New Jersey and surrounding regions could negatively impact the growth opportunities available to SJI and the financial condition of the customers and prospects of SJI.\n\u2022\nChanges in the regulatory environment or unfavorable rate regulation at its utility may have an unfavorable impact on SJI's financial performance or condition. SJI's utility business is regulated by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) which has authority over many of the activities of the utility business including, but not limited to, the rates it charges to its customers, the amount and type of securities it can issue, the nature of investments it can make, the nature and quality of services it provides, safety standards and other matters. The extent to which the actions of regulatory commissions restrict or delay SJG's ability to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital and/or fully recover operating costs may adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\u2022\nSJI may not be able to respond effectively to competition, which may negatively impact SJI's financial performance or condition. Regulatory initiatives may provide or enhance opportunities for competitors that could reduce utility income obtained from existing or prospective customers. Also, competitors in all of SJI's business lines may be able to provide superior or less costly products or services based upon currently available or newly developed technologies.\n\u2022\nWarm weather, high commodity costs, or customer conservation initiatives could result in reduced demand for some of SJI's energy products and services. SJI's utility currently has a conservation incentive program clause that protects its revenues and gross margin against usage that is lower than a set level. Should this clause be terminated without replacement, lower customer energy utilization levels would likely reduce SJI's net income. Further, during periods of warmer temperatures, demand and volatility in the natural gas market could decrease, which would negatively impact the Company's financial results.\n\u2022\nHigh natural gas prices could cause more of SJI's receivables to be uncollectible. Higher levels of uncollectibles from either residential or commercial customers would negatively impact SJI's income and could result in higher working capital requirements.\n\u2022\nSJI's net income could decrease if it is required to incur additional costs to comply with new governmental safety, health or environmental legislation. SJI is subject to extensive and changing federal and state laws and regulations that impact many aspects of its business; including the storage, transportation and distribution of natural gas, as well as the remediation of environmental contamination at former manufactured gas plant facilities.\nSouth Jersey Industries, Inc.\nPart I\n\u2022\nClimate change legislation could impact SJI's financial performance and condition. Climate change is receiving ever increasing attention from both scientists and legislators. The debate is ongoing as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potential causes of this change and its future impacts. Some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome of federal and state actions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs, including additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions. These actions could affect the demand for natural gas and electricity, result in increased costs to our business and impact the prices we charge our customers. Because natural gas is a fossil fuel with low carbon content, it is possible that future carbon constraints could create additional demands for natural gas, both for production of electricity and direct use in homes and businesses. Any adoption by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. We cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\u2022\nSJI's wholesale commodity marketing and retail electric businesses are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe money or energy to SJI will not be able to meet their obligations for operational or financial reasons. SJI could be forced to buy or sell commodity at a loss as a result of such failure. Such a failure, if large enough, could also impact SJI's liquidity.\n\u2022\nIncreasing interest rates would negatively impact the net income of SJI. Several of SJI's subsidiaries are capital intensive, resulting in the incurrence of significant amounts of debt financing. Some of the long-term debt of SJI and its subsidiaries is issued at fixed rates or has utilized interest rate swaps to mitigate changes in variable rates. However, long-term debt of SJI at variable rates, along with all variable rate short-term borrowings, are exposed to the impact of rising interest rates.\n\u2022\nThe inability to obtain capital, particularly short-term capital from commercial banks, could negatively impact the daily operations and financial performance of SJI. SJI uses short-term borrowings under committed credit facilities provided by commercial banks to supplement cash provided by operations, to support working capital needs, and to finance capital expenditures, as incurred. SJG also relies upon short-term borrowings issued under a commercial paper program supported by a committed bank credit facility to support working capital needs, and to finance capital expenditures, as incurred. If the customary sources of short-term capital were no longer available due to market conditions, SJI and its subsidiaries may not be able to meet their working capital and capital expenditure requirements and borrowing costs could increase.\n\u2022\nA downgrade in either SJI's or SJG's credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access adequate and cost-effective capital. Our ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective capital depends to a significant degree on our credit ratings, which are greatly influenced by our financial condition and results of operations. If the rating agencies downgrade either SJI's or SJG's credit ratings, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase. In addition, we would likely be required to pay higher interest rates in future financings and potential funding sources would likely decrease. To the extent that a decline in SJG's credit rating has a negative effect on SJI, SJI could be required to provide additional support to certain counterparties.\n\u2022\nHedging activities of the Company designed to protect against commodity price or interest rate risk may cause fluctuations in reported financial results and SJI's stock price could be adversely affected as a result. Although SJI enters into various contracts to hedge the value of energy assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions, the timing of the recognition of gains or losses on these economic hedges in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America does not always match up with the gains or losses on the items being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.\n\u2022\nThe inability to obtain natural gas or electricity from suppliers would negatively impact the financial performance of SJI. Several of SJI's subsidiaries have businesses based upon the ability to deliver natural gas or electricity to customers. Disruption in the production or transportation to SJI from its suppliers could prevent SJI from completing sales to its customers.\nSouth Jersey Industries, Inc.\nPart I\n\u2022\nTransporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs. SJI's gas distribution activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidents, mechanical problems, natural disasters or terrorist activities which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of operations, which in turn could lead to substantial losses. In accordance with customary industry practice, SJI maintains insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events, even if fully covered by insurance, could adversely affect SJI's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nAdverse results in legal proceedings could be detrimental to the financial condition of SJI. The outcomes of legal proceedings can be unpredictable and can result in adverse judgments.\n\u2022\nRenewable energy projects at Marina receive significant benefit from regulatory incentives. A significant portion of the expected return on investment of these renewable energy projects is dependent upon the future market for renewable energy credits (RECs). The benefits from RECs are produced during the entire life of the project. As a result, earnings from existing projects would be adversely affected without a liquid REC market. In addition, the return on investment from new projects may not be as attractive if a liquid REC market ceases to exist. Therefore, these projects are exposed to the risk that favorable regulatory incentives expire or are adversely modified.\n\u2022\nConstraints in available pipeline capacity, particularly in the Marcellus Shale producing region, may negatively impact SJI's financial performance. Natural gas production and/or pipeline transportation disruptions in the Marcellus region, where SJI has natural gas receipt requirements, may cause temporary take-away constraints resulting in higher transportation costs and the sale of shale gas at a loss.\n\u2022\nThe risk of terrorism may adversely affect the economy as well as SJI's business. An act of terror could result in disruptions of natural gas supplies and cause instability in the financial and capital markets. This could adversely impact SJI's ability to deliver products or raise capital and could adversely impact its results of operations.\n\u2022\nFailure to obtain proper approvals and property rights in the PennEast pipeline could hinder SJI's equity investment in the project. Construction, development and operation of energy investments, specifically the PennEast pipeline, are subject to federal and state regulatory oversight and require certain property rights from public and private property owners, as well as regulatory approvals, including environmental and other permits and licenses. SJI, as well as our joint venture partners in the PennEast pipeline, may be unable to obtain all such needed property rights, permits and licenses to successfully construct and develop the pipeline, and failing to do so could cause SJI's equity investment in the project to become impaired. Such impairment could have a materially adverse effect on SJI's financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur business could be harmed by cybersecurity threats and related disruptions. We rely extensively on information technology systems to process transactions, transmit and store information and manage our business. Disruption or failure of our information technology systems could shut down our facilities or otherwise harm our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers, serve our customers effectively, manage our assets, or otherwise materially disrupt our business. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. SJI has experienced such attacks in the past; however, based on information currently available to SJI, none have had a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In response, we have invested in expanded cybersecurity systems and procedures designed to safeguard the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems and protect against unauthorized access. However, all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to security threats, including hacking, viruses, other malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to such systems. There is no guarantee that our cybersecurity systems and procedures will prevent or detect the unauthorized access by experienced computer programmers, hackers or others. An attack on or failure of our information technology systems could result in the unauthorized disclosure, theft, misuse or destruction of customer or employee data or business or confidential information, or disrupt the performance of our information technology systems. These events could expose us to potential liability, litigation, governmental inquiries, investigations or regulatory actions, harm our brand and reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, and subject us to payment of fines or other penalties, legal claims by our clients and significant remediation costs.\nSouth Jersey Industries, Inc.\nPart I\n\u2022\nOur stated long-term goals are based on various assumptions and beliefs that may not prove to be accurate, and we may not achieve our stated long-term goals by 2020 or at all. Our current long-term goals are to (i) grow Economic Earnings to at least $150 million by 2020; (ii) improve the quality of our earnings; (iii) strengthen our balance sheet; and (iv) maintain a low-to-moderate risk profile. Management established those goals in conjunction with our board of directors based upon a number of different internal and external factors that characterize and influence our current and expected future activities. For example, these long-term goals are based on certain assumptions regarding our participation in a current project to build a 100-mile natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. However, construction on this project has not yet begun, and this project is subject to a number of regulatory approvals, including approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The target completion date for this project has been delayed until the second half of 2018, and may be subject to further delay. As a result, no assurance can be given that this project will be completed on time or at all. Further, the economy of Southern New Jersey has remained depressed relative to other regions, which could cause increased customer delinquencies or otherwise negatively affect achievement of our long-term earnings goals. Due to a term limit, the upcoming 2017 New Jersey gubernatorial election will result in a change in administration, which could lead to unfavorable local regulatory changes that could delay approvals, require environmental remediation or capital or other expenditures or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Other factors, assumptions and beliefs of management and our board of directors on which our long-term goals were based may also prove to differ materially from actual future results. Accordingly, we may not achieve our stated long-term goals by 2020 or at all, or our stated long-term goals may be negatively revised as a result of less than expected progress toward achieving these goals, and you are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these goals.", "PERMNO": 26614, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "SJI"}
