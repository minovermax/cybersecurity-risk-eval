{"cik": "912752", "company": "SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as general economic conditions, geopolitical events, competition, technological obsolescence, and employee relations. The risks described below, along with risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial, may impair our business operations and our liquidity in an adverse way.\nRisks relating to our general operations\nOur strategic acquisitions and investments could pose various risks and increase our leverage.\nWe have pursued and intend to selectively continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, subject to market conditions, our liquidity, and the availability of attractive acquisition and investment candidates, with the goal of improving our business. We may not be able to identify other attractive acquisitions or investment targets, or we may not be able to fund additional acquisitions or investments in the future.\nAcquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could strain our human resources. Additionally, we may not be able to successfully implement effective cost controls, achieve expected synergies, or increase revenues as a result of an acquisition. In addition, future acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities and may result in the diversion of management's attention from the operation of our core business.\nCertain acquisitions, such as television stations, are subject to the approval of the FCC and potentially, other regulatory authorities, such as the Department of Justice. The need for FCC and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest certain television stations or businesses if the FCC or other regulatory authority believes that a proposed acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market, even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with FCC ownership limitations or other regulation. There can be no assurance that future acquisitions will be approved by the FCC or other regulatory authorities, or that a requirement to divest existing stations or business will not have an adverse outcome on the transaction.\nFinancial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our industry, business, and results of operations or financial condition.\nFinancial and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business, results of operations, and/or financial condition. Poor economic and industry conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industry of those customers who advertise on our stations, including, among others, the automotive industry and service businesses, each of which is a significant source of our advertising revenue. Additionally, financial institutions, capital providers, or other consumers may be adversely affected. Potential consequences of any financial and economic decline include:\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of those companies that advertise on our stations, sports networks, and digital platforms, including, among others, the automobile manufacturers and dealers, may be adversely affected and could result in a significant decline in our advertising revenue;\n\u2022\nour ability to pursue the acquisition of attractive assets may be limited if we are unable to obtain any necessary additional capital on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nour ability to pursue the divestiture of certain assets at attractive values may be limited;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that our business partners, such as counterparties to our outsourcing and news share arrangements and parties to joint ventures with the RSNs, could be negatively impacted and our ability to maintain these business relationships could also be impaired;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance our existing debt on terms and at interest rates we find attractive, if at all, may be impaired;\n\u2022\nour ability to make certain capital expenditures may be significantly impaired;\n\u2022\ncontent providers may cut back on the amount of content we can acquire to program the RSNs or stations; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility of consumers cutting the cord, thereby impacting our retransmission revenues and affiliate fees.\nThe Smiths exercise control over most matters submitted to a shareholder vote and may have interests that differ from other security holders. They may, therefore, take actions that are not in the interests of other security holders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, David D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, J. Duncan Smith, and Robert E. Smith hold shares representing approximately 76.8% of the common stock voting rights of the Company and, therefore, control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, including, but not limited to, electing directors, adopting amendments to our certificate of incorporation, and approving corporate transactions. The Smiths hold substantially all of the Class B Common Stock, which have ten votes per share. Our Class A Common Stock has only one vote per share. In addition, the Smiths hold four of our board of directors' seats and, therefore, have the power to exert significant influence over our corporate management and policies. The Smiths have entered into a stockholders' agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to vote for each other as candidates for election to our board of directors until December 31, 2025.\nAlthough in the past the Smiths have recused themselves from related person transactions, circumstances may occur in which the interests of the Smiths, as the controlling security holders, could be in conflict with the interests of other security holders and the Smiths would have the ability to cause us to take actions in their interest. In addition, the Smiths could pursue acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to our other security holders. Further, the concentration of ownership the Smiths have may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a future change of control, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our shares.\n(See Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters and Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, which will be included as part of our Proxy Statement for our 2020 Annual Meeting.)\nSignificant divestitures by the Smiths could cause them to own or control less than 51% of the voting power of our shares, which in turn (i) could, as discussed under A failure to comply with covenants under debt instruments could result in a default under such debt instruments, acceleration of amounts due under our debt and loss of assets securing our loans within Item 1A. Risk Factors, under certain circumstances require us to offer to buy back some or all of our outstanding notes and could result in an event of default under each of the STG Bank Credit Agreement and the DSG Bank Credit Agreement and (ii) give Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation (Cunningham) the right to terminate the LMAs and other outsourcing agreements with Cunningham due to a \"change in control.\" Any such termination of LMAs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The FCC's multiple ownership rules may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs. Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets. See the risk factor below regarding the FCC's multiple ownership rules.\nKey officers and directors have financial interests that are different and sometimes opposite from ours and we may engage in transactions with these officers and directors that may benefit them to the detriment of other security holders.\nSome of our officers, directors, and majority shareholders own stock or partnership interests in businesses that do business with us or otherwise do business that conflicts with our interests. They may transact some business with us upon approval by the independent members of our board of directors even if there is a conflict of interest or they may engage in business competitive to our business and those transactions may benefit the officers, directors or majority shareholders to the detriment of our security holders. Each of David D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, and J. Duncan Smith is an officer and director of Sinclair and Robert E. Smith is a director of Sinclair. Together, the Smiths hold shares of our common stock that control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.\nDavid D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, J. Duncan Smith, and Robert E. Smith together own interests (less than 5% in aggregate) in Allegiance Capital Limited Partnership, a limited partnership in which we also hold an interest. Frederick G. Smith owns an interest (less than 1%) in Patriot Capital II, L.P., a limited partnership in which we also hold an interest. For additional information regarding our related person transactions, see Note 15. Related Person Transactions within the Consolidated Financial Statements. We can give no assurance that these transactions or any transactions that we may enter into in the future with our officers, directors, or majority shareholders, have been, or will be, negotiated on terms as favorable to us as we would obtain from unrelated parties. Maryland law and our financing agreements limit the extent to which our officers, directors, and majority shareholders may transact business with us and pursue business opportunities that we might pursue. These limitations do not, however, prohibit all such transactions.\nOur investments in other non-media related businesses involve risks, including the diversion of resources, that may adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe have made investments in certain non-media related businesses. See Item 1. Business for further description of such investments and/or subsidiaries. Managing the operations of these businesses and the costs incurred by these businesses involve risks, including the diversion of our management's attention from managing the operations of our broadcast businesses and diverting other resources that could be used in our broadcast and sports businesses. Such diversion of resources may adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, our investments in real estate ventures carry inherent risks related to owning interests in real property, including, among others, the relative illiquidity of real estate, potential adverse changes in real estate market conditions, and changes in tenant preferences. There can be no assurance that our investments in these businesses will yield a positive rate of return or otherwise be recoverable.\nIf the rate of decline in the number of subscribers to MVPD services increases or these subscribers shift to other services or bundles that do not include our programming networks, there may be a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nDuring the last few years, the number of subscribers to MVPD services in the United States has been declining. In addition, distributors have introduced, marketed and/or modified tiers or bundles of programming that have impacted the number of subscribers that receive our programming networks, including tiers or bundles of programming that exclude our programming networks.\nIf MVPD service offerings are not attractive to consumers for any reason (including due to pricing, increased competition from OTT and DTC services, increased dissatisfaction with the quality of MVPD services, poor economic conditions or other factors), more consumers may (i) cancel their MVPD service subscriptions or choose not to subscribe to traditional services, (ii) elect to instead subscribe to OTT services, which in some cases may be offered at lower prices, (iii) elect to subscribe to MVPDs with smaller bundles of programming which may not include our programming networks, or (iv) elect not to subscribe to any subscription-based service. If the rate of decline in the number of MVPD service subscribers increases or if subscribers shift to OTT services or smaller bundles of programming that do not include our programming networks, this may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nWe may not be able to renegotiate retransmission consent agreements at terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements and networks with which we are affiliated are currently, or in the future are expected to, require us to share revenue from retransmission consent agreements with them.\nAs retransmission consent agreements expire, we may not be able to renegotiate such agreements at terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements. This may cause revenues and/or revenue growth from our retransmission consent agreements to decrease under the renegotiated terms despite the fact that our current retransmission consent agreements include automatic annual fee escalators. In addition, certain networks or program service providers with which our stations are affiliated are currently, or in the future are expected to, require us to share revenue from retransmission consent agreements with them as part of renewing expiring affiliation agreements or pursuant to certain rights contained in existing affiliation agreements. Generally, our retransmission consent agreements and agreements with networks or program service providers are for different lengths of time and expire in different periods. If we are unable to negotiate a retransmission consent agreement or the revenue received as part of those agreements declines over time, then we may be exposed to a reduction in or loss from retransmission revenue net of revenue shared with networks and program service providers. We cannot predict the outcome or provide assurances as to the outcome of any future negotiations relating to our affiliation agreements or what impact, if any, they may have on our financial condition and results of operations. See Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business for a listing of expirations of our affiliations agreements as of December 31, 2019.\nDuring 2016, we entered into a consent decree with the FCC pursuant to an investigation regarding allegations made by an MVPD that we violated FCC rules relating to negotiating retransmission consent agreements. See Changes in the Rules of Television Ownership, Local Marketing Agreements, Joint Sales Agreements, Retransmission Consent Negotiations, and National Ownership Cap under Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nWe face intense, wide-ranging competition for viewers and advertisers.\nWe compete, in certain respects and to varying degrees, for viewers and advertisers with other programming networks, pay-per-view, video on demand, online streaming services, and other content offered by distributors. We also compete for viewers and advertisers with content offered over the Internet, mobile media, radio, motion picture, home video, stadiums and arenas, and other sources of information and entertainment and advertising services. Important competitive factors are the prices we charge for our programming networks, the quantity, quality (in particular, the performance of the sports teams whose media rights we control) and variety of the programming offered and the effectiveness of marketing efforts.\nWith respect to advertising services, factors affecting the degree and extent of competition include prices, reach and audience demographics among others. Some of our competitors are large companies that have greater financial resources available to them than we do, which could impact our viewership and the resulting advertising revenues.\nCompetition from other broadcasters or other content providers and changes in technology may cause a reduction in our advertising revenues and/or an increase in our operating costs.\nNew technology and the subdivision of markets\nCable providers, direct broadcast satellite companies, and telecommunication companies are developing or have developed new technology that allows them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences, reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets. Competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues. The decreased cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets and compete with us for advertising revenue. In addition, technologies that allow viewers to digitally record, store, and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials as recorded by media measurement services such as Nielsen or Comscore and, as a result, lower our advertising revenues. The current ratings provided by Nielsen for use by broadcast stations for live viewing Digital Video Recording playback are limited to 7 days past the original air date. Additionally, in most market, no credit is given for online viewing. The effects of new ratings system technologies, including ''code readers,'' ''viewer assignment,'' ''portal people meters,'' and ''set-top boxes (used in Nielsen's RPD+ methodology)'' and the ability of such technologies to be a reliable standard that can be used by advertisers is still under review for accreditation from The Media Rating Council, an independent organization that monitors rating services. As of December 31, 2019, Sinclair's footprint includes 20 markets that will use Portable People Meters, 7 Meter markets that will see Set Top Box data added, 12 markets measured by Code Reader methodology, and 47 markets measured by RPD+ methodology.\nCable providers, direct broadcast satellite companies, and telecommunication companies may include over-the-air antennas within their set-top boxes allowing them to provide free over-the-air signals to their subscribers which could result in decreases in our distributions revenues received for our signal being carried on their channels.\nSince digital television technology allows broadcasting of multiple channels within the additional allocated spectrum, this technology could expose us to additional competition from programming alternatives. In addition, technological advancements and the resulting increase in programming alternatives, such as cable television, direct broadcast satellite systems, pay-per-view, home video and entertainment systems, video-on-demand, OTT, mobile video, and the Internet have also created new types of competition to television broadcast stations and RSNs, and will increase competition for household audiences and advertisers.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that we will remain competitive with these developing technologies.\nTypes of competitors\nWe also face competition from rivals that may have greater resources than we have. These include:\n\u2022\nother local free over-the-air broadcast television and radio stations;\n\u2022\ntelecommunication companies;\n\u2022\ncable and satellite system operators and cable networks;\n\u2022\nprint media providers such as newspapers, direct mail and periodicals;\n\u2022\ninternet search engines, internet service providers, websites, and mobile applications;\n\u2022\n\u2022\nover-the-top technologies;\n\u2022\nMVPD \"skinny\" packages;\n\u2022\nmobile television; and\n\u2022\nother emerging technologies.\nDeregulation\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 and subsequent actions by the FCC and the courts have removed some limits on station ownership, allowing telephone, cable, and some other companies to provide video services in competition with us. In addition, the FCC has reallocated and auctioned off a portion of the spectrum for new services including fixed and mobile wireless services and digital broadcast services. As a result of these changes, new companies are able to enter our markets and compete with us.\nWe depend on the appeal of our programming, which may be unpredictable, and increased programming costs may have a material negative effect on our business and our results of operations.\nWe depend in part upon viewer preferences and audience acceptance of the programming on our stations and networks. These factors are often unpredictable and subject to influences that are beyond our control, such as the quality and appeal of competing programming, general economic conditions and the availability of other entertainment options. We may not be able to successfully predict interest in proposed new programming and viewer preferences could cause new programming not to be successful or cause our existing programming to decline in popularity. An increase in our costs associated with programming, including original programming, or a decrease in viewership of our programming, may materially negatively affect us and our results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely on third parties for broadcast, news, sports and other programming for our stations and networks. We compete with other providers of programming to acquire the rights to distribute such programming. If we fail to continue to obtain broadcast, news, sports and other programming for our stations and networks on reasonable terms for any reason, including as a result of competition, we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming, which may have a material negative effect on us and our results of operations.\nFurther change in the current retransmission consent regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMVPDs lobby to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. On March 3, 2011, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine its rules (1) governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between MVPDs and broadcasters, including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement; (2) for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute; and (3) to extend certain cable-only obligations to all MVPDs. The FCC also asked for comment on eliminating the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, which may permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations in certain circumstances.\nOn March 31, 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing \u201cgood faith\u201d retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. On December 5, 2014, Congress extended the joint negotiation prohibition to all non-commonly owned television stations in a market and in February 2015 the FCC issued an order implementing those statutorily required changes to its rules governing the duty to negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith. Under these rules, unless the stations are directly or indirectly under common de jure control as permitted under the regulations of the Commission, a station may not delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to a station located in the same market or to a third party that negotiates together with another television station in the same market, nor may stations in the same market facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms for their stations in that market, including through the sharing of information.\nConcurrently with its adoption of the prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations, the FCC also adopted a further notice of proposed rulemaking which sought additional comment on whether it has authority to, and should, eliminate or modify its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. The FCC\u2019s prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations and its possible elimination or modification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules may affect the Company\u2019s ability to sustain its current level of retransmission consent revenues or grow such revenues in the future and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company cannot predict the resolution of the FCC\u2019s network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity proposals, or the impact of these proposals, on its business.\nIn September 2015, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in response to a Congressional directive in STELAR to examine the \u201ctotality of the circumstances test\u201d for good-faith negotiations of retransmission consent. The proposed rulemaking sought comment on new factors and evidence to consider in its evaluation of claims of bad faith negotiation, including service interruptions prior to a \u201cmarquee sports or entertainment event,\u201d restrictions on online access to broadcast programming during negotiation impasses, broadcasters\u2019 ability to offer bundles of broadcast signals with other broadcast stations or cable networks, and broadcasters\u2019 ability to invoke the FCC\u2019s exclusivity rules during service interruptions. On July 14, 2016, the FCC's then-Chairman Wheeler announced that the FCC would not, at that time, proceed to adopt additional rules governing good faith negotiations of retransmission consent. No formal action has yet been taken on this proposed rulemaking, and we cannot predict if the full Commission will agree to terminate the rulemaking without action.\nIn adopting fiscal year 2020 appropriations legislation in December 2019, Congress allowed STELAR to sunset on December 31, 2019 but made permanent STELAR\u2019s (1) requirements that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate retransmission consent in good faith and (2) distant-signal satellite license provisions for RVs, truckers, tailgaters and short markets. To qualify for the permanent license, satellite operators must deliver local-into-local service in all currently \u201cunserved\u201d markets by the appropriations bill\u2019s May 31, 2020 deadline. At the same time, Congress enacted Section 1003 of the Television Viewer Protection Act (TVPA), which directed the FCC to commence a rulemaking proceeding to revise the FCC\u2019s rules to specify that \u201ccertain small MVPDs can meet the obligation to negotiate [retransmission consent] in good faith . . . by negotiating with a large station group through a qualified MVPD buying group.\u201d The FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on January 31, 2020 to amend its retransmission consent rules to implement Section 1003 of the TVPA. Comments are due on or before March 5, 2020, and reply comments are due on or before March 16, 2020.\nCertain online video distributors have begun streaming broadcast programming over the Internet. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that a streaming service provider\u2019s retransmissions of broadcast television signals without the consent of the broadcast station violated copyright holders\u2019 rights under the Copyright Act. In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term \u201cMVPD\u201d to encompass online video distributors that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such service providers. Comments and reply comments were filed in 2015 and the proceeding remains pending at this time. We cannot predict whether the FCC will act in that proceeding or what the outcome of the proceeding would be.\nCosts of complying with changes in governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe cannot predict what other governmental laws or regulations will be enacted in the future, how future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or how future laws or regulations will affect us. Compliance with new laws or regulations, including proposed legislation to address climate change, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require us to incur significant expenditures or impose significant restrictions on us and could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nTheft of our intellectual property may have a material negative effect on us and our results of operations, and we may become subject to infringement or other claims relating to our consent or technology.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize the material intellectual property rights in our programming, technology, digital and other content. Our intellectual property rights may be infringed upon by unauthorized usage of original broadcast content, RSN telecast feeds (including, without limitation, live and non-live content) and other content for which the RSNs and/or the applicable league/team hold copyright ownership or distribution rights. Such unauthorized usage may occur on any and all distribution platforms, including, without limitation, linear and streaming services. Additionally, our intellectual property rights may be further infringed upon by third-party unauthorized distribution of original broadcast content, game content and/or highlights on social media platforms on a live or near live basis. Third-party licensors of content may infringe upon our intellectual property rights by not complying with content distribution rules, local territory blackout rules and RSN distribution exclusivity windows.\nTheft, misappropriation or the invalidity of our intellectual property or the intellectual property that is licensed to us by licensors (including sports teams) could have a material negative effect on us and our results of operations by potentially reducing the revenue that we are able to obtain from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content, undermining lawful and revenue-generating distribution channels, limiting our ability to control the marketing of our content and inhibiting our ability to recoup expenses or profit from the costs we incur creating our programming content. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or protect our trade secrets. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome, could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert management's attention from the operation of our business.\nWhile our programming personnel regularly monitor third-party streaming platforms and social media pages in an effort to identify intellectual property infringement and work closely with content distributors and leagues to notify content protection representatives to take the necessary steps to protect our and their intellectual property rights, those protective measures cannot ensure that theft, misappropriation or the invalidity of our intellectual property or the intellectual property that is licensed to us by licensors will not occur.\nIn addition, from time to time, third parties may assert claims against us alleging intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to our programming, technology, digital or other content. If any such infringement claim results in the loss of certain of our intellectual property rights, it could have a materially negative impact our business and the results of our operations.\nCybersecurity risks, cyber incidents, data privacy, and other information technology failures could adversely affect us and disrupt our operations.\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment, and other business processes. Despite our security measures (including, multi-factor authentication, security information and event management and firewalls and testing tools), network and information systems-related events, such as computer hackings, cyber threats, security breaches, viruses or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, or malicious or other activities could result in a disruption of our services and operations. These events could also result in, but are not limited to, the improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, including through third parties which receive any of such information on a confidential basis for business purposes and could be subject to any of these events, and damage our reputation or require us to expend significant resources to remedy. The occurrence of any of these events, and the additional regulations relating to this area and the costs related thereto, could have a material adverse effect on us. While we maintain insurance to cover losses related to cybersecurity risks, such policies may not be sufficient to cover all losses,\nWe could be adversely affected by labor disputes and legislation and other union activity.\nThe cost of producing and distributing entertainment programming has increased substantially in recent years due to, among other things, the increasing demands of creative talent and industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. Although we generally purchase programming content from others rather than produce such content ourselves, our program suppliers engage the services of writers, directors, actors and on-air and other talent, trade employees, and others, some of whom are subject to these collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 1,630 of our employees and freelance employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements. If we or our program suppliers are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Failure to renew these agreements, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect our business by causing, among other things, delays in production that lead to declining viewers, a significant disruption of operations, and reductions in the profit margins of our programming and the amounts we can charge advertisers for time. Our stations and RSNs also broadcast certain professional sporting events, and our viewership may be adversely affected by player strikes or lockouts, which could adversely affect our advertising revenues and results of operations. Further, any changes in the existing labor laws, including the possible enactment of the Employee Free Choice Act, may further the realization of the foregoing risks.\nWe depend on key personnel and we may not be able to operate and grow our business effectively if we lose the services of our senior executive officers or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future.\nWe depend on the efforts of our management and other key employees. The success of our business depends heavily on our ability to develop and retain management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management personnel is intense, and we may not be able to retain our key personnel. If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe effects of the economic environment could require us to record an asset impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nWe are required to analyze goodwill and certain other intangible assets for impairment. The accounting guidance establishes a method of testing goodwill and broadcast licenses for impairment on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if an event occurs that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived asset below its carrying value. For additional information regarding impairments to our goodwill and broadcast licenses, see Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges in accounting standards can affect reported earnings and results of operations.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and accompanying pronouncements and implementation guidelines for many aspects of our business, including those related to revenues, leases, consolidation, programming, intangible assets, pensions, income taxes, share-based compensation, and broadcast and sports rights, are complex and involve significant judgments. Changes in rules or their interpretation could significantly change our reported earnings, results of operations, and compliance with debt covenants.\nIf we fail to maintain the requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ stock market, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which would adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed for quotation on the NASDAQ stock market. We are required to meet specified listing criteria in order to maintain our listing. If we fail to satisfy continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted. Any potential delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ would make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our stock in the public market and would likely result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility for our common stock.\nTerrorism, armed conflict domestically or abroad, or other catastrophic events may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. Future conflicts, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence, or catastrophic events may have a similar effect.\nIf the United States becomes engaged in global conflicts in the future, there may be an adverse effect on our results of operations. Also, any terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may have a similar negative effect on our business or results of operations. Also, other catastrophic events or health epidemics could disrupt our business or the business of our customers which could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nUnrelated third parties may bring claims against us based on the nature and content of information posted on websites maintained by us.\nWe host internet services that enable individuals to exchange information, generate content, comment on our content, and engage in various online activities. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and internationally. Claims may be brought against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that may be posted online or generated by our users. Our defense of such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.\nThe cost of complying with governmental laws related to data privacy, information security and data protection may adversely affect our results of operations\nWe collect, store, process and use certain personally identifiable information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security and data protection. Any cybersecurity breaches or our actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal obligations by us, or by our third-party service providers or partners, could potentially harm our business and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and/or regulatory fines or other action.\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data collection, use of data and data protection is intensifying globally, and the personal information and other data we collect, store, process and use is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, especially in Europe and increasingly across the United States. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and often develop in ways we cannot predict and may materially increase our cost of doing business, particularly as we expand the nature and types of products we offer.\nIn May 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") came into effect. The GDPR imposes more stringent European Union data protection requirements and provides for substantially greater penalties for noncompliance. Further, there is increased scrutiny over data transfers between Europe and the United States, and dealings with the United Kingdom may become more complex following Brexit.\nOn January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), came into effect. The CCPA provides new rights to California residents and requires that covered companies that collect information about California residents make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, honor requests from consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and delete information upon request with certain exceptions. It provides for enforcement by the California Attorney General beginning July 1, 2020 and provides a new private right of action for data breaches. Proposed regulations have been published but are not yet final. The burdens imposed by the CCPA and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditure in order to comply.\nRisks relating to our local news and marketing services segment\nOur advertising revenue can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control. This volatility affects our operating results and may reduce our ability to repay indebtedness or reduce the market value of our securities.\nWe rely on sales of advertising time for a significant portion of our local news and marketing services segment revenues and, as a result, our operating results depend on the amount of advertising revenue we generate. If we generate less advertising revenue, it may be more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness and the value of our business may decline. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on:\n\u2022\nthe levels of automobile and services advertising, which historically have represented a large portion of our advertising revenue; for the year ended December 31, 2019, automobile and services advertising represented 25% and 22%, respectively, of our advertising revenue;\n\u2022\nthe levels of political advertising, which are significantly higher in even-number years and elevated further every four years related to the presidential election, historically have represented a large portion of our advertising revenue; for the year ended December 31, 2019, political advertising represented 3% of our advertising revenue;\n\u2022\nthe levels of political advertising, which are affected by political beliefs, public opinion, campaign finance laws, and the ability of political candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds which are subject to seasonal fluctuations;\n\u2022\nthe health of the economy in the areas where our television stations are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u2022\nthe popularity of our programming and that of our competition;\n\u2022\nthe effects of declining live/appointment viewership as reported through rating systems and local television efforts to adopt and receive credit for same day viewing plus viewing on-demand thereafter;\n\u2022\nthe effects of new rating methodologies;\n\u2022\nchanges in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located;\n\u2022\nthe activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based mediums, such as other broadcast television stations, radio stations, MVPDs, internet and broadband content providers and other print, outdoor, and media outlets serving in the same markets;\n\u2022\nOTT and other emerging technologies and their potential impact on cord-cutting;\n\u2022\nthe impact of MVPDs and OTT distributors offering \"skinny\" programming bundles that may not include all programming of television broadcast stations and/or cable channels, such as Tennis Channel;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing and sellout levels; and\n\u2022\nother factors that may be beyond our control.\nThere can be no assurance that our advertising revenue will not be volatile in the future or that such volatility will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe purchase television programming in advance based on expectations about future revenues. Actual revenues may be lower than our expectations. If this happens, we could experience losses that may make our securities less valuable.\nOne of our stations' most significant costs is network and syndicated programming. Our ability to generate revenue to cover this cost may affect the value of our securities. If a particular network or program is not popular in relation to its costs, we may not be able to sell enough advertising time to cover the cost.\nWe generally purchase syndicated programming content from others rather than producing such content ourselves, therefore, we have limited control over the costs of the programming. Often, we must purchase syndicated programming several years in advance and may have to commit to purchase more than one year's worth of programming. We may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred or before we have fully amortized the costs. We also receive programming from networks with which we have network affiliation agreements. Generally, the agreements are for several years. The popularity of networks can affect revenue earned on those channels. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. These factors are exacerbated during a weak advertising market.\nWe internally originate television programming in advance based on expectations about future revenues. Actual revenues could fluctuate and may be lower than our expectations. If this happens, we could experience losses that may make our securities less valuable.\nThe production of internally originated programming requires a large up-front investment and the revenues derived from the airing of internally originated programming primarily depends upon its acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of original content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing content released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of a growing number of alternative forms of entertainment, general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending, and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues. These factors are exacerbated during a weak advertising market.\nWe may lose a large amount of programming if a network terminates its affiliation or program service arrangement with us, we are not able to negotiate arrangements at terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements, or if networks make programming available through services other than our local affiliates, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our revenue.\nThe networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each station's commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during programming and for cash fees. The amount and quality of programming provided by each network varies. See Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business for a detailed listing of our stations and channels as of December 31, 2019.\nAs network affiliation agreements come up for renewal, we (or licensees of the stations we provide programming and/or sales services to), may not be able to negotiate terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements. The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the relevant network. This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and which may not be as attractive to our target audiences, resulting in reduced revenues. Upon the termination of any of our network affiliation agreements, we would be required to establish a new network affiliation agreement for the affected station with another network or operate as an independent station.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of any future negotiations relating to our affiliation agreements or what impact, if any, they may have on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the impact of an increase in reverse network compensation payments, under which we compensate the network for programming pursuant to our affiliation agreements, may have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business for a listing of expirations of our affiliations agreements as of December 31, 2019.\nWe may be subject to investigations or fines from governmental authorities, such as, but not limited to penalties related to violations of FCC indecency, children's programming, sponsorship identification, and other FCC rules and policies, the enforcement of which has increased in recent years, and complaints related to such violations may delay our renewal applications with the FCC.\nWe provide a significant amount of live news reporting that is provided by the broadcast networks or is controlled by our on-air news talent. Although both broadcast network and our on-air talent have generally been professional and careful in what they say, there is always the possibility that information may be reported that is inaccurate or even in violation of certain indecency rules promulgated by the FCC. In addition, entertainment and sports programming provided by broadcast syndicators and networks may contain content that is in violation of the indecency rules promulgated by the FCC. Because the interpretation by the courts and the FCC of the indecency rules is not always clear, it is sometimes difficult for us to determine in advance what may be indecent programming. We have insurance to cover some of the liabilities that may occur, but the FCC has enhanced its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency. Also, the FCC has various rules governing children's television programming, including commercial matter limitations. We are subject to such rules regardless of whether the programming is produced by us or by third parties. Violation of the indecency or children's programming rules could potentially subject us to penalties, license revocation, or renewal or qualification proceedings. There can be no assurance that an incident that may lead to significant fines or other penalties by the FCC can be avoided.\nFrom time to time, we may have received or been promised payment for airing program material. FCC rules require that all such sponsored material be explicitly identified at the time of the broadcast as paid for and by whom, except when it is clear that the mention of a product or service constitutes sponsorship identification. There can be no assurance that an incident that may lead to significant fines or other penalties by the FCC can be avoided. On December 21, 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture proposing a $13 million fine for violations of the FCC's sponsorship identification rules by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. We have responded to dispute the Commission's findings and the proposed fine; however, we cannot predict the outcome of any potential FCC action related to this matter.\nFrom time to time, we may be the subject of an investigation from governmental authorities. For example, as described more fully under The FCC's multiple ownership rules and federal antitrust regulation may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs. Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets below. On January 4, 2019, the Company received three CIDs from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ relating to JSAs in a certain DMAs. We believe the DOJ has issued similar civil investigative demands to other companies in our industry. There can be no assurance that an investigation will not lead to an action or proceeding against us. In the event an action or proceeding is commenced, we may be subject to fines, penalties and changes in our business that could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations\nFederal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility, which may affect our ability to generate revenue or reduce our costs.\nThe FCC regulates our business, just as it does all other companies in the broadcasting industry. We must obtain the FCC's approval whenever we need a new license, seek to renew, assign or modify a license, purchase a new station, sell an existing station, or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that hold a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations; we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions in a timely manner, if at all. If licenses are not renewed or acquisitions are not approved, we may lose revenue that we otherwise could have earned.\nIn addition, Congress and the FCC may, in the future, adopt new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters (including, but not limited to, technological changes in spectrum assigned to particular services) that could, directly or indirectly, materially and adversely affect the operation and ownership of our broadcast properties. (See Item 1. Business.)\nThe FCC's multiple ownership rules and federal antitrust regulation may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs. Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets.\nTelevision ownership\nAs discussed in National Ownership Rule under Federal Regulation of Television Broadcasting within Item 1. Business, in April 2017 the FCC adopted the UHF Discount Order on Reconsideration to restore the UHF discount, which reinstatement became effective in June 2017. A Petition to Review the UHF Discount Order on Reconsideration was filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in May 2017, and dismissed by the Court in July 2018. On December 18, 2017, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to examine the National Ownership Rule, including the UHF discount, which remains pending. We cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking proceeding. Because we are near the 39% cap without application of the UHF discount, changes to the UHF discount or National Ownership Rule could limit our ability to acquire television stations in additional markets.\nUnder federal law, the FCC is required to review its ownership rules every four years (a Quadrennial Regulatory Review) to determine whether they are necessary in the public interest as the result of competition and to repeal or modify any regulation the FCC determines to be no longer in the public interest.\nIn August 2016, the FCC completed both its 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews of its media ownership rules and issued an order (Ownership Order) which left most of the existing multiple ownership rules intact, but amended the rules to provide for the attribution of JSAs where two television stations are located in the same market, and a party with an attributable interest in one station sells more than 15% of the advertising time per week of the other station. The Ownership Order also required that JSAs that existed prior to March 31, 2014, may remain in place until October 1, 2025, at which point they must be terminated, amended or otherwise come into compliance with the rules. These \"grandfathered\" JSAs could be transferred or assigned without losing grandfathering status. The subsequent Ownership Order on Reconsideration eliminated the JSA attribution rule and eliminated or modified other multiple ownership rules, including the Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule and the Local Television Ownership Rule. The rule changes adopted in the Ownership Order on Reconsideration became effective on February 7, 2018. Petitions for Review of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration, including elimination of the JSA attribution rule, were filed before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On September 23, 2019, the court vacated and remanded the Ownership Order on Reconsideration. Petitions for rehearing en banc were filed by the FCC and industry intervenors on November 7, 2019. The Third Circuit denied the petitions for rehearing on November 20, 2019 and the court\u2019s mandate issued on November 29, 2019. On February 7, 2020, the FCC and industry intervenors filed applications to extend the time to file petitions for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court from February 18, 2020 to March 19, 2020, which applications were granted on February 12, 2020. We cannot predict whether the Supreme Court will grant a writ of certiorari or what the outcome of the proceeding would be. If we are required to terminate or modify our JSAs, our business could be adversely affected in several ways, including losses on investments and termination penalties. See Note 14. Variable Interest Entities within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our JSAs which we consolidate as variable interest entities.\nCertain of our stations have entered into what have commonly been referred to as local marketing agreements or LMAs. One typical type of LMA is a programming agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market, whereby the licensee of one station programs substantial portions of the broadcast day and sells advertising time during such programming segments on the other licensee's station subject to the ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter licensee. We believe these arrangements allow us to reduce our operating expenses and enhance profitability. See Note 14. Variable Interest Entities within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our LMAs which we consolidate as variable interest entities.\nIn addition to our LMAs, we have entered into outsourcing agreements (such as JSAs) whereby 34 stations provide various non-programming related services such as sales, operational and managerial services to or by other stations within the same markets. We believe this structure allows stations to achieve operational efficiencies and economies of scale, which should otherwise improve broadcast cash flow and competitive positions. For additional information, refer to Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business.\nOn December 13, 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to initiate the 2018 Quadrennial Regulatory Review of the FCC's broadcast ownership rules. The NPRM seeks comment on whether the Local Radio Ownership Rule, the Local Television Ownership Rule, and the Dual Network Rule continue to be necessary in the public interest or whether they should be modified or eliminated. With respect to the Local Television Ownership Rule specifically, among other things, the NPRM seeks comment on possible modifications to the rule's operation, including the relevant product market, the numerical limit, the top-four prohibition; and the implications of multicasting, satellite stations, low power stations and the next generation standard. In addition, the NPRM examines further several diversity related proposals raised in the last quadrennial review proceeding. The public comment period began on April 29, 2019, and reply comments were due by May 29, 2019. We cannot predict when the FCC will conclude the 2018 Quadrennial Regulatory Review or what the outcome of the proceeding will be.\nOn January 4, 2019, the Company received three CIDs from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ. In each CID, the DOJ requested that the Company produce certain documents and materials relating to JSAs in a specific DMA. We believe the DOJ has issued similar civil investigative demands to other companies in our industry. We are cooperating and are in discussions with the DOJ regarding our response to the CID. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of the CID process, including whether it will result in any action or proceeding against us.\nSee Changes in the Rules of Television Ownership, Local Marketing Agreements, Joint Sales Agreements, Retransmission Consent Negotiations, and National Ownership Cap under Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we are required to terminate or modify our LMAs and other outsourcing agreements, our business could be affected in the following ways:\n\u2022\nLoss of revenues. If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements, we would lose some or all of the revenues generated from those arrangements. We would lose revenue because we will have fewer demographic options, a smaller audience distribution and lower revenue share to offer to advertisers.\n\u2022\nIncreased costs. If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements, our cost structure would increase as we would potentially lose significant operating synergies and we may also need to add new employees. With termination of LMAs, we likely would incur increased programming costs because we will be competing with the separately owned station for syndicated programming.\n\u2022\nLosses on investments. As part of certain of our arrangements, we own the non-license assets used by the stations with which we have arrangements. If certain of these arrangements are no longer permitted, we would be forced to sell these assets, restructure our agreements or find another use for them. If this happens, the market for such assets may not be as good as when we purchased them and, therefore, we cannot be certain of a favorable return on our original investments.\n\u2022\nTermination penalties. If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements before the terms of the arrangements expire, or under certain circumstances, we elect not to extend the terms of the arrangements, we may be forced to pay termination penalties under the terms of certain of our arrangements. Any such termination penalties could be material.\n\u2022\nAlternative arrangements. If the FCC requires us to terminate the existing arrangements, we may enter into one or more alternative arrangements. Any such arrangements may be on terms that are less beneficial to us than the existing arrangements.\nFailure of owner / licensee to exercise control\nThe FCC requires the owner / licensee of a station to maintain independent control over the programming and operations of the station. As a result, the owners / licensees of those stations with which we have LMAs can exert their control in ways that may be counter to our interests, including the right to preempt or terminate programming in certain instances. The preemption and termination rights cause some uncertainty as to whether we will be able to air all of the programming that we have purchased under our LMAs and therefore, uncertainty about the advertising revenue that we will receive from such programming. In addition, if the FCC determines that the owner / licensee is not exercising sufficient control, it may penalize the owner licensee by a fine, revocation of the license for the station or a denial of the renewal of that license. Any one of these scenarios, especially the revocation of or denial of renewal of a license, might result in a reduction of our cash flow or margins and an increase in our operating costs. In addition, penalties might also affect our qualifications to hold FCC licenses, putting our own licenses at risk.\nThe pendency and indeterminacy of the outcome of these ownership rules and the CIDs, which may limit our ability to provide services to additional or existing stations pursuant to licenses, LMAs, outsourcing agreements or otherwise, expose us to a certain amount of volatility, particularly if the outcomes are adverse to us. Further, resolution of these ownership rules and the CIDs has been and will likely continue to be a cost burden and a distraction to our management and the continued absence of a resolution may have a negative effect on our business.\nThe FCC's National Broadband Plan may result in a loss of spectrum for our stations potentially adversely impacting our ability to compete.\nCongress authorized the FCC to conduct so-called \"incentive auctions\" to auction and re-purpose broadcast television spectrum for mobile broadband use. See Broadcast Incentive Auction under Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our participation, results, and post-auction process.\nWe cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt further policies or incentive auctions which may affect our broadcast spectrum.\nWe have invested and will continue to invest in new technology initiatives which may not result in usable technology or intellectual property.\nWe have heavily invested in the development of the NEXTGEN TV platforms as discussed in Development of Next Generation Wireless Platform under Operating Strategy within Item 1. Business. We do not know whether the outcome of our research and development will result in technology that will be usable on our distribution platform or available to license to third parties. Additionally, even if our efforts result in usable technology, we do not know whether it will be included within the NEXTGEN TV framework. Any failure to develop this technology could result in the loss of our investment. Our cost incurred related to the development of the NEXTGEN TV platform is recorded within non-media expenses within our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, we have developed, on our own and through joint ventures, several NEXTGEN TV related patents that we will attempt to monetize directly, through third-party agents, or through a patent pool designed to consolidate similar patents owned by independent licensors for licensing to equipment manufacturers. We do not know whether our attempts at monetization will result in licensing arrangements that will be accepted by such equipment manufacturers or result in any royalty payments for our intellectual property rights.\nRisks relating to our sports segment\nFollowing the acquisition of the RSNs, we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of the relevant assets with each other or with our existing operations or to achieve all of our anticipated synergies from the acquisition of the RSNs.\nThe success of the acquisition of the RSNs will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from integrating the acquired RSN's assets with our existing business. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses must be successfully combined.\nWe may be required to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain, integrate, improve or sustain operations, or take unexpected write-offs or impairment charges resulting from the RSN Acquisition. Further, we may be subject to unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the assets. If any of these factors occur or limit our ability to integrate the businesses successfully or on a timely basis, the expectations of our future financial conditions and results of operations might not be met.\nIn addition, we believe that we can achieve run rate production and programming synergies over the next five years. We plan to achieve a significant portion of those synergies by modernizing production facilities and technology and the remainder by leveraging our programming to drive reductions in programming costs. However, our plans to modernize production facilities and technology may not achieve the savings we anticipate, and we may not be successful in negotiating agreements or taking other steps to reduce programming costs. Any failure to achieve our anticipated synergies could have an adverse effect on results of operations for future periods. In addition, we expect to incur costs to achieve these synergies, and those costs could exceed the costs that we expect, which could also adversely affect the results of operations.\nOur media rights agreements with various professional sports teams have varying durations and terms and we may be unable to renew those agreements on acceptable terms or such rights may be lost for other reasons.\nOur ability to generate revenues is dependent upon media rights agreements with professional sports teams. As of December 31, 2019, we had a weighted average remaining life of 10 years under our exclusive media rights agreements. Upon expiration, we may seek renewal of these agreements and, if we do, we may be outbid by competing programming networks or others for these agreements or the renewal costs could substantially exceed our costs under the current agreements. Even if we are to renew such agreements, our results of operations could be adversely affected if increases in sports programming rights costs outpace increases in affiliate fee and advertising revenues. In addition, one or more of these sports teams may seek to establish their own programming network or join one of our competitor's networks or regional sports network and, in certain circumstances, we may not have an opportunity to bid for the media rights. Also, there is a risk that certain rights can be distributed via digital rights and the RSNs would not have the same monetization for such rights.\nMoreover, the value of these agreements may also be affected by various league decisions and/or league agreements that we may not be able to control, including a decision to alter the number of games played during a season. The governing bodies of the MLB, NBA and NHL have imposed, and may impose in the future, various rules, regulations, guidelines, bulletins, directives, policies and agreements (collectively, \u201cLeague Rules\u201d), which could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. For example, the League Rules define the territories in which we may distribute games of the teams in the applicable league. Changes to the League Rules, or the adoption of new League Rules, could affect our media rights agreements with the various teams and as consequence have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. For example, the leagues may give digital rights to other distributors may allocate more games for national feeds or other distributors and/or incentivize participation in league-controlled sports networks.\nThe value of these media rights can also be affected, or we could lose such rights entirely, if a team is liquidated, undergoes reorganization in bankruptcy or relocates to an area where it is not possible or commercially feasible for us to continue to distribute programming for such team. Any loss or diminution in the value of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by us and could materially negatively affect us and our results of operations. In addition, our affiliation agreements with MVPDs typically include certain remedies in the event our networks fail to meet a minimum number of professional event telecasts, and, accordingly, any loss of rights could materially negatively affect our business and our results of operations.\nOur sports segment\u2019s success depends on affiliate fees we receive, the loss of which or renewal of which on less favorable terms may have a material negative effect on us and our results of operations.\nOur sports segment\u2019s success is dependent upon the existence and terms of our agreements with MVPDs, OTT and other streaming distributors. Our existing agreements for our programming networks expire at various dates. Given the relatively short-term nature of our existing agreements, a number of agreements with MVPDs are up for renewal and under negotiation at any given time. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to renew these affiliation agreements or obtain terms as attractive as our existing agreements in the event of a renewal. In addition, some of the affiliation agreements also include so-called \"most favored nations\" provisions which require that certain terms (including, potentially, the material terms) of such agreements are no less favorable than those provided to any similarly situated MVPD. If triggered, these most favored nations provisions could cause our payments or other obligations under those agreements to increase, which could result in our inability to achieve the originally anticipated benefits of such agreements.\nAffiliate fees constitute the substantial majority of our sports segment revenues. For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, sports segment affiliate fees constituted 92% of our sports segment revenue and 45% of our consolidated total revenue. Changes in affiliate fee revenues generally result from a combination of changes in rates, subscriber counts. Reductions in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid, including as a result of a loss of, or reduction in carriage of, our programming networks, would adversely affect our affiliate fee revenue. For example, distributors may introduce, market and/or modify tiers of programming networks that could impact the number of subscribers that receive our programming networks, including tiers of programming that may exclude our networks. Any loss or reduction in carriage would also decrease the potential audience for our programming, which may adversely affect our advertising revenues. See \"-If the rate of decline in the number of subscribers to MVPD services increases or these subscribers shift to other services or bundles that do not include our programming networks, there may be a material negative effect on our affiliate fee revenue.\" In some cases, subscribers may decide to \"cut the cord\" and not subscribe to MVPD or other streaming services, which would result in a decline in affiliate fees.\nOur affiliation agreements generally require us to meet certain content criteria, such as minimum thresholds for professional event telecasts throughout the year on our networks. If we were unable to meet these criteria, we could become subject to remedies available to the distributors, which may include fee reductions, rebates or refunds and/or termination of these agreements.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, an existing agreement may expire and we may have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. For example, our affiliation agreement with Dish Network Corporation (Dish) expired on July 26, 2019. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, revenue from Dish and its OTT service, Sling TV, accounted for 12% of the sports segment\u2019s affiliate fee revenues. While distributors may continue to carry the services in certain of these circumstances until the execution of definitive renewal or replacement agreements (or until we or the distributor determine that carriage should cease), distributors may instead elect to stop carrying, or \"blackout,\" the services upon the expiration of an agreement. For example, upon the expiration of the Dish affiliation agreement, Dish stopped broadcasting Sinclair's RSNs and such blackout continues. While we continue to negotiate with Dish, we cannot predict whether we will reach an agreement or whether such agreement will be on terms as favorable to us as the terms of our prior agreement with Dish. Thus, we cannot predict how long the Dish blackout might last. Whether distributors continue to carry the services or not during the renegotiation of our agreement with them, an expiration of an existing agreement without a renewal or replacement thereof may materially adversely affect our business.\nOccasionally, we may have disputes with distributors over the terms of our agreements. If not resolved through business discussions, such disputes could result in litigation or actual or threatened termination of an existing agreement.\nIn addition, the pay television industry is highly concentrated, with a relatively small number of distributors serving a significant percentage of pay television subscribers that receive our programming networks, thereby affording the largest distributors significant leverage in their relationship with programming networks, including us. A substantial majority of our sports segment affiliate fee revenue comes from our top three distributors. Further consolidation in the industry could reduce the number of distributors available to distribute our programming networks and increase the negotiating leverage of certain distributors, which could adversely affect our revenue. In some cases, if a distributor is acquired, the affiliation agreement of the acquiring distributor will govern following the acquisition. In those circumstances, the acquisition of a distributor that is a party to one or more affiliation agreements with us on terms that are more favorable to us than that of the acquirer could have a material negative impact on us and our results of operations.\nOur joint venture arrangements are subject to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have invested in a number of our RSNs through joint ventures with certain teams, and we may form additional joint ventures in the future. As of December 31, 2019, we were joint venture partners with six teams in the RSNs that distribute content for each respective team. The nature of the joint ventures requires us to consult with and share certain decision-making powers with unaffiliated third parties. Further, differences in economic or business interests or goals among joint venture participants could result in delayed decisions, failures to agree on major issues and even litigation. If these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business or strategic plans, or if our joint venture partners take actions contrary to our policies, objectives or the best interests of the joint venture, our results could be adversely affected.\nOur participation in joint ventures is also subject to the risks that:\n\u2022\nWe could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision- making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to maintain good relationships with our joint venture partners, which could limit our future growth potential and could have an adverse effect on our business strategies.\n\u2022\nOur joint venture partners could have investment or operational goals that are not consistent with our corporate-wide objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for investments or future growth opportunities.\n\u2022\nOur joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their other obligations as joint venture partners, which could cause us to decide to infuse our own capital into any such venture on behalf of the related joint venture partner or partners despite other competing uses for such capital.\n\u2022\nSome of our existing joint ventures require mandatory capital expenditures for the benefit of the applicable joint venture, which could limit our ability to expend funds on other corporate opportunities.\n\u2022\nSome of our joint venture partners have exit rights that require us to purchase their interests upon the occurrence of certain events or the passage of certain time periods, which could impact our financial condition by requiring us to incur additional indebtedness in order to complete such transactions or otherwise use cash that could have been spent on alternative investments.\n\u2022\nOur joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues.\n\u2022\nAny sale or other disposition of our interest in a joint venture or underlying assets of the joint venture may require consents from our joint venture partners, which we may not be able to obtain.\n\u2022\nCertain corporate-wide or strategic transactions may also trigger other contractual rights held by a joint venture partner (including termination or liquidation rights) depending on how the transaction is structured, which could impact our ability to complete such transactions.\nOur sports segment is substantially dependent on the popularity of the MLB, NBA and NHL teams whose media rights we control.\nOur sports segment is dependent on the popularity of the MLB, NBA and NHL teams whose local media rights we control and, in varying degrees, those teams achieving on-field, on-court and on-ice success, which can generate fan enthusiasm, resulting in increased viewership and advertising revenues. Furthermore, success in the regular season may qualify a team for participation in the post-season, which generates increased interest in such team, thereby improving viewership and advertising revenues. Alternatively, if a team declines in popularity or fails to generate fan enthusiasm, this may negatively impact viewership and advertising revenues and the terms on which our affiliation agreements are renewed. There can be no assurance that any sports team will generate or maintain fan enthusiasm or compete in post-season play, and the failure to do so could result in a material negative effect on us and our results of operations.\nOur advertising revenue can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control, which volatility may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on sales of advertising time for a portion of our sports segment revenues and, as a result, our operating results depend on the amount of advertising revenue we generate. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on:\n\u2022\nthe success of the automotive industry, which historically has provided a significant portion of our advertising revenue;\n\u2022\nthe health of the economy in the areas where our networks are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u2022\nthe popularity of our programming and that of our competition;\n\u2022\nthe popularity of the sports teams with which we own rights;\n\u2022\nthe effects of declining live/appointment viewership as reported through rating systems and local television efforts to adopt and receive credit for same day viewing plus viewing on-demand thereafter;\n\u2022\nthe effects of new rating methodologies;\n\u2022\nchanges in the makeup of the population in the areas where our networks are located;\n\u2022\nthe activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based mediums, such as radio stations, MVPDs, vMVPDs, internet and broadband content providers and other print, outdoor, Internet and media outlets serving in the same markets;\n\u2022\nOTT and other emerging technologies and their potential impact on cord-cutting;\n\u2022\nthe impact of MVPDs and OTT distributors not offering our networks or offering \"skinny\" programming bundles that may not include all programming of our networks;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing and sellout levels;\n\u2022\nother factors that may be beyond our control;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our salespeople to sell and market our content;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete with MVPDs that are selling the advertising time that we provide them, which they are able to bundle with other sports and other geographic locations; and\n\u2022\nadvertisers' desire to message to our viewer demographic.\nThere can be no assurance that our advertising revenue will not be volatile in the future or that such volatility will not have an adverse impact on us, our financial condition, or our results of operations.\nWe may be obligated to make certain payments to local teams during labor disputes.\nWe may be impacted by union relations of professional sports leagues. Each of the NBA, the NHL and MLB has experienced labor difficulties in the past and may have labor issues, such as players' strikes or management lockouts, in the future. For example, the NBA has experienced labor difficulties, including lockouts during the 1998-99 and 2011-12 seasons, resulting in a shortened regular season in each case. The NHL has also experienced labor difficulties, including lockouts during the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons, resulting in a shortened regular season in each case, and a lockout beginning in September 2004, which resulted in the cancellation of the entire 2004-05 NHL season. MLB has also experienced labor difficulties, including players' strikes during the 1972, 1981 and 1994 seasons, resulting in a shortened regular season in each case, and the loss of the entire post-season and the World Series in 1994.\nAny labor disputes between professional sports leagues and players' unions may preclude us from airing or otherwise distributing scheduled games for which we have the rights to broadcast, resulting in decreased revenues, which would adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations. In addition, any labor disputes between professional sports leagues and players' unions may result in us having to broadcast games with substitute players, which would adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations. Although many of our current programming rights agreements with local teams account for labor disputes with certain pro rata reductions in the rights fees owed thereunder, we have a contractual obligation in some cases to continue paying a certain portion of such rights fees notwithstanding any labor dispute.\nWe may need to obtain FCC-regulated licenses for RSN video distribution.\nOur RSNs require use of certain uplinks and downlink facilities for video distribution. Such facilities are licensed by the FCC and subject to FCC regulations. We do not currently own any such authorizations and have entered a transition services agreement whereby a third party, as the FCC-licensee of existing uplink and downlink licenses, provides services related to these authorizations. Upon termination or expiration of the transition services agreement, we may need to acquire such authorizations from the current licensee or obtain new authorizations. In either case, the Company would need to apply for and obtain prior FCC consent. From time to time, the FCC places limits or holds on applications related to such authorizations, and we cannot guarantee that the FCC will grant our applications.\nRisks relating to our indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nWe have a high level of debt, totaling $12,438 million at December 31, 2019, compared to the book value of shareholders' equity of $1,694 million on the same date.\nOur high level of debt poses risks, including the following risks, particularly in periods of declining revenues:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to service our debt obligations, especially during negative economic, financial credit and market industry conditions;\n\u2022\nwe may require a significant portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt, especially during negative economic and market industry conditions;\n\u2022\nthe amount available for joint ventures, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes may be limited because a significant portion of cash flow is used to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nif our affiliate and advertising revenues decline, we may not be able to service our debt;\n\u2022\nif we are unable to renew team sports media rights or renew on less favorable terms, we may not be able to service our debt;\n\u2022\nour lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for future joint ventures, working capital needs, additional acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nthe cost to borrow from lenders may increase;\n\u2022\nour ability to access the capital markets may be limited, and we may be unable to issue securities with pricing or other terms that we find attractive, if at all;\n\u2022\nif our cash flow were inadequate to make interest and principal payments, we might have to restructure or refinance our indebtedness or sell an equity interest in one or more of our RSNs to reduce debt service obligations;\n\u2022\nwe may be limited in our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus, less able to withstand competitive pressures.\nAny of these events could reduce our ability to generate cash available for investment, repay, restructure or refinance our debt, seek additional debt or equity capital, make capital improvements or to respond to events that would enhance profitability.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of equity interests in our RSNs, other material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Sinclair Television Group, Inc. (STG) Bank Credit Agreement, the Diamond Sports Group, LLC (DSG) Bank Credit Agreement, and each of the indentures that govern the notes will restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from such dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of our indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the STG Bank Credit Agreement and the DSG Bank Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan us money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their obligations and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described herein.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of the debt instruments to which we are subject contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and the guarantors now face could intensify.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly.\nInterest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on the obligations under the STG Bank Credit Agreement and the DSG Bank Credit Agreement or other variable rate debt offerings could be higher or lower than current levels. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $5,917 million principal amount of our debt relates to the STG Bank Credit Agreement and the DSG Bank Credit Agreement, in each case subject to variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR could affect interest rates under our variable rate debt.\nLIBOR is used as a reference rate under the STG Bank Credit Agreement and the DSG Bank Credit Agreement. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist at that time, if a new method of calculating LIBOR will be established, or if an alternative reference rate will be established. The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. We are not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be available or if SOFR, or another alternative rate reference rate, attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we will need to agree upon a benchmark replacement index with the bank, and as such the interest rate on the STG Bank Credit Agreement and the DSG Bank Credit Agreement may change. The new rate may not be as favorable as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out. Furthermore, the transition process may result in delays in funding, higher interest expense, additional expenses, and increased volatility in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR, all of which could negatively impact our cash flow.\nCommitments we have made to our lenders limit our ability to take actions that could increase the value of our securities and business or may require us to take actions that decrease the value of our securities and business.\nOur existing financing agreements prevent us from taking certain actions and require us to meet certain tests. These restrictions and tests may require us to conduct our business in ways that make it more difficult to repay unsecured debt or decrease the value of our securities and business. These restrictions and tests include the following:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the incurrence, assumption or guaranteeing of additional debt, or the issuance of disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to guarantee and pledge our assets as security for indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to prepay or redeem certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on payment of dividends, the repurchase of stock and other payments relating to our capital stock;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on some sales of certain assets and the use of proceeds from asset sales;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on mergers and other acquisitions, satisfaction of conditions for acquisitions and a limit on the total amount of acquisitions without the consent of bank lenders;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on permitted investments;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the lines of business we and our subsidiaries may operate; and\n\u2022\nfinancial ratio and condition tests including, the ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, as adjusted, the ratio of first lien indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, as adjusted, and the ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as adjusted, to fixed charges.\nFuture financing arrangements may contain additional restrictions and tests. In addition, the limited liability company agreement governing the terms of the Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Equity will also restrict Diamond Sports Holdings LLC's (DSH) and its subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends and make distributions relating to our other capital stock, and future issuances of equity by DSH. All of these restrictive covenants may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies, prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of our securities or may require actions that decrease the value of our securities.\nIn addition, we may fail to meet the tests and thereby default on one or more of our obligations (particularly if the economy weakens and thereby reduces our advertising revenues). If we default on our obligations, creditors could require immediate payment of the obligations or foreclose on collateral. If this happens, we could be forced to sell assets or take other actions that could significantly reduce the value of our securities and business and we may not have sufficient assets or funds to pay our debt obligations.\nA failure to comply with covenants under debt instruments could result in a default under such debt instruments, acceleration of amounts due under our debt and loss of assets securing our loans.\nCertain of our debt agreements will contain cross-default provisions with other debt, which means that a default under certain of our debt instruments may cause a default under such other debt. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a default under the DSG Senior Notes or DSG Bank Credit Agreement would not trigger a cross-default under the STG Bank Credit Agreement or the STG Senior Notes (as defined below), or vice versa.\nIf we breach certain of our debt covenants, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately take possession of the property securing such debt. In addition, if any other debtholder were to declare its loan due and payable as a result of a default, the holders of our outstanding notes, along with the lenders under the STG Bank Credit Agreement and the DSG Bank Credit Agreement, might be able to require us to pay those debts immediately.\nAs a result, any default under debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet our obligations.\nThe total assets, net income and attributable EBITDA of our subsidiary guarantors of the DSG Notes may decrease substantially if our existing subsidiary guarantors cease to be wholly-owned as a result of the issuance of equity of the subsidiaries to third parties.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we are joint venture partners with six teams in the RSNs that distribute content for each respective team. In connection with our efforts to renew our existing media rights agreements, we may enter into new agreements that provide our joint venture partners or other investors a minority equity interest in the RSNs that are currently wholly-owned. Such RSNs would not be wholly-owned by us, and because the indentures that govern the DSG Senior Notes only requires wholly-owned subsidiaries to guarantee the DSG Senior Notes, such RSNs would no longer be required to guarantee the DSG Senior Notes. As a result, the total assets, net income and attributable EBITDA of our non-guarantor subsidiaries could increase substantially, which could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations under the DSG Senior Notes.\nOur joint venture agreements contain provisions which may result in cash payments that would reduce our ability to repay our obligations under our indebtedness.\nOur joint venture agreements contain certain provisions which may result in cash payments that would decrease our available cash and may reduce our ability to repay our obligations under our indebtedness.\nFor example, as of December 31, 2019, our joint venture agreements with three teams contained provisions by which we were or may become contractually obligated, at the team's option, to purchase a portion of or all of the team's equity interest in the joint venture at a pre-determined price. If additional teams exercise their put rights pursuant to the joint venture agreements, it would require us to make cash payments that would decrease our available cash and may reduce our ability to repay our obligations under our indebtedness, including the Notes. In January 2020, one of these teams exercised their right to sell their interest to the Company for $376 million.", "PERMNO": 81740, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "SBGI"}
