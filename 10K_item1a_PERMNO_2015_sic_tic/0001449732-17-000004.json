{"cik": "1449732", "company": "Willbros Group, Inc.\\NEW\\", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe nature of our business and operations subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur business is highly dependent upon the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas and electric power companies on infrastructure.\nOur revenue and cash flow are primarily dependent upon major construction projects. The availability of these types of projects is dependent upon the economic condition of the oil and gas and electric power industries, and specifically, the level of capital expenditures of oil and gas and electric power companies on infrastructure. Our failure to obtain major projects, the delay in awards of major projects, the cancellation of major projects or delays in completion of contracts are factors that could result in the under-utilization of our resources, which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow. Numerous factors beyond our control influence the level of capital expenditures of these companies, including:\n\u2022\ncurrent and projected oil and gas and electric power prices;\n\u2022\nthe demand for gasoline and electricity;\n\u2022\nthe abilities of oil and gas and electric power companies to generate, access and deploy capital;\n\u2022\nexploration, production and transportation costs;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate and location of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe sale and expiration dates of oil and gas leases and concessions;\n\u2022\nregulatory restraints on the rates that electric power companies may charge their customers;\n\u2022\nlocal and international political and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\ntechnological advances.\nWe face a risk of non-compliance with certain covenants in our credit facilities.\nWe are subject to a number of financial and other covenants under our credit facilities, including a Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio. On March 31, 2015, March 1, 2016, July 26, 2016 and March 3, 2017 we amended our 2014 Term Credit Agreement pursuant to a first amendment, third amendment, fourth amendment and fifth amendment (the \u201cFifth Amendment\u201d). These amendments, among other things, suspend the calculation of the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the period from December 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 (the \u201cCovenant Suspension Periods\u201d) so that any failure by us to comply with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio or Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio covenants during the Covenant Suspension Periods will not be deemed to result in a default or event of default. Prior to obtaining the Fifth Amendment, we did not expect to be in compliance with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the period from March 31, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will remain in compliance with our financial covenants in the periods following the completion of the Covenant Suspension Periods or that we would be successful in obtaining additional waivers or amendments to these covenants should they become necessary. Under the Fifth Amendment, the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio will be 5.50 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and will decrease to 4.50 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2017 and 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2018 and thereafter. The Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio will be 1.60 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and will increase to 2.00 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2017 and 2.75 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2018 and thereafter. If our results of operations do not improve in 2017, we will be unable to meet the required financial covenants.\nIn order to ensure future compliance with our financial covenants, we may elect to prepay our credit agreement indebtedness by accessing capital markets or with cash on hand. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in accessing capital markets on terms we consider favorable or reducing costs in amounts sufficient to comply with our financial covenants. Moreover, future prepayments or refinancing of the balance of the 2014 Term Credit Agreement will, in most cases, require us to pay a prepayment premium equal to the \u201cmake-whole\u201d amount. The make-whole amount is calculated as the present value of all interest payments that would have been made on the amount prepaid from the date of the prepayment to December 15, 2019 (or June 15, 2019 if the prepayment is made on or after June 15, 2018) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 9.75 percent plus the greater of 1.25 percent and the Eurodollar rate in effect on the date of the repayment.\nEven if we successfully comply with our financial covenants, we may suffer adverse consequences if our unused availability under our 2013 ABL Credit Facility drops below certain levels. If our unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility is less than the greater of (i) 15 percent of the revolving commitments or $15.0 million for five consecutive days, or (ii) 12.5 percent of the revolving commitments or $12.5 million at any time, we are subject to increased reporting requirements, the administrative agent will have exclusive control over any deposit account, we will not have any right of access to, or withdrawal from, any deposit account, or any right to direct the disposition of funds in any deposit account, and amounts in any deposit account will be applied to reduce the outstanding amounts under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility. In addition, if our unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility is less than the amounts described in the preceding sentence, we would be required to comply with a Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenant.\nOur unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility was $40.3 million at December 31, 2016. We do not expect our availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility to drop to levels which would require us to comply with the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant over the next 12 months. However, if the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio were to become applicable, we would not expect to be in compliance with this covenant.\nA default under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility would permit the lenders to terminate their commitment to make cash advances or issue letters of credit, require us to immediately repay any outstanding cash advances with interest and require us to cash collateralize outstanding letter of credit obligations. A default under the 2014 Term Credit Agreement would permit the lenders to require immediate repayment of all principal, interest, fees and other amounts payable thereunder. If the maturity of our credit agreement indebtedness were accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to pay such indebtedness. In such an event, our lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness, which includes substantially all of our assets, to the extent permitted by the credit agreements and applicable law.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which could impede our growth.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. A substantial number of the major projects that we pursue are awarded based on bid proposals. We compete for these projects against companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In some markets, there is competition from national and regional firms against which we may not be able to compete on price. Our growth may be impacted to the extent that we are unable to successfully bid against these companies. Our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures, greater resources or other advantages and, therefore, may be able to provide their services at lower rates than ours or elect to place bids on projects that drive down margins to lower levels than we would accept.\nWe have had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in prior fiscal years. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis. As a result, our business, operating results and liquidity could be harmed.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that led to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, most recently for the first three quarters of 2011 and the first two quarters of 2014. We also identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, 2011, and 2010 and for the years 2004 through 2007. We believe that all of these material weaknesses have been successfully remediated.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud, even effective internal controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements.\nA pending securities class action against us has resulted in significant costs and expenses, has diverted resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs further described in Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, after we announced that we would be restating our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2014, a securities class action complaint was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of our shareholders and alleging damages on their behalf arising from the matters that led to the restatements. In addition to us, two of our former Chief Executive Officers and our current Chief Financial Officer are named as defendants. We have incurred and/or expect to incur significant professional fees and other costs in defending against the\nallegations made by the plaintiffs in the class action suit. If we do not prevail in the pending litigation, we may be required to pay a significant amount of monetary damages that may be in excess of our insurance coverage. In addition, our Board of Directors, management and employees may expend a substantial amount of time on the pending litigation, diverting resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur use of fixed-price contracts could adversely affect our operating results.\nA significant portion of our revenues is currently generated by fixed-price contracts. Under a fixed-price contract, we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project, based upon a defined scope, which includes specific assumptions and project criteria. If our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur, our margins will decrease, and we may incur a loss. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on a fixed-price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract. If we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks, we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year. In general, turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed-price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations. This risk is a result of the long-term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts, whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract.\nIn addition, our Utility T&D segment also generates substantial revenue under unit-price contracts under which we have agreed to perform identified units of work for an agreed price, which have similar associated risks as those identified above for fixed-price contracts. A \u201cunit\u201d can be as small as the installation of a single bolt or a foot of cable or as large as a transmission tower or foundation. The resulting profitability of a particular unit is primarily dependent upon the labor and equipment hours expended to complete the task that comprises the unit. Failure to accurately estimate the costs of completing a particular project could result in reduced profits or losses.\nPercentage-of-completion method of accounting for contract revenue may result in adjustments that would materially affect our operating results.\nWe recognize contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method on long-term fixed-price contracts. Under this method, estimated contract revenue is accrued based generally on the percentage that costs to date bear to total estimated costs, taking into consideration physical completion. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Accordingly, contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved, and adjustments based upon the percentage-of-completion are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised. These estimates are based on management\u2019s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience and are only estimates. Variation of actual results from these assumptions or our historical experience could be material. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract revenue, we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.\nOur backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.\nWe cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable. Projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. In addition, project cancellations, terminations or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn. Many of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them, in some cases without any provision for penalties or lost profits. Therefore, project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts in our backlog. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits.\nManaging backlog in our Utility T&D segment also has other challenges. Backlog for anticipated projects in this segment is determined based on recurring historical trends, seasonal demand and projected customer needs, but the agreements in this segment rarely have minimum volume or spending obligations, and many of the contracts may be terminated by the customers on short notice. For projects in this segment on which we have commenced work that are canceled, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenues included in our backlog.\nLegislative or regulatory actions relating to electricity transmission and renewable energy may impact the demand for our services.\nCurrent and potential legislative or regulatory actions may impact demand for our services. Certain legislation or regulations require utilities to meet reliability standards and encourage installation of new electric transmission and renewable energy generation facilities. However, it is unclear whether these initiatives will create sufficient incentives for projects or result in increased demand for our services.\nWhile many states have mandates in place that require specified percentages of electricity to be generated from renewable sources, states could reduce those mandates or make them optional, which could reduce, delay or eliminate renewable energy development in the affected states. Additionally, renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as a backup. The locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and may not be viable unless new or expanded transmission infrastructure to transport the electricity to demand centers is economically feasible. Furthermore, funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be available. These factors could result in fewer renewable energy projects and a delay in the construction of these projects and the related infrastructure, which could negatively impact our business.\nSeasonal variations and inclement weather may cause fluctuations in our operating results, profitability, cash flow and working capital needs related to our operating segments.\nA significant portion of our business in each of our operating segments is performed outdoors. Consequently, our results of operations are exposed to seasonal variations and inclement weather. Our operating segments perform less work in the winter months, and work is hindered during other inclement weather events. In particular, our Utility T&D segment revenue and profitability often decrease during the winter months and during severe weather conditions because work performed during these periods is more costly to complete. During periods of peak electric power demand in the summer, utilities generally are unable to remove their electric power T&D equipment from service, decreasing the demand for our maintenance services during such periods. The seasonality of this segment\u2019s business also causes our working capital needs to fluctuate. Because this segment\u2019s operating cash flow is usually lower during and immediately following the winter months, we typically experience a need to finance a portion of this segment\u2019s working capital during the spring and summer. Conversely, our Canada segment typically posts its strongest results during the winter and summer months and weaker results during what is known as the \u201cSpring breakup,\u201d when road bans and load limits are put in place and workers are often furloughed and equipment idled. Severe winter weather can also create demand for restoration of storm damage to overhead utility lines, which can offer opportunities for high margin emergency restoration work for our Utility T&D segment.\nOur failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners for payment could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. These types of claims occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional costs, both direct and indirect. These claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur business is dependent on a limited number of key clients.\nWe operate primarily in the oil and gas and power industries, providing services to a limited number of clients. Much of our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with our major clients and obtaining a share of contracts from these clients. The loss of any of our major clients could have a material adverse effect on our operations. One client was responsible for approximately 25.0 percent of total contract revenue from continuing operations in 2016. This client was also responsible for 42.6 percent of our 12-month backlog and 45.8 percent of our total backlog at December 31, 2016.\nTerrorist attacks and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, our ability to raise capital or secure insurance or our future growth.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action will likely lead to continued volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our operations. In addition, future acts of terrorism could be\ndirected against companies operating both outside and inside the United States. Further, the U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. These developments may subject our operations to increased risks and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are subject to a number of operational risks.\nOur business operations include pipeline construction, fabrication, pipeline rehabilitation services and a wide range of services in electric power and natural gas transmission and distribution. We may encounter difficulties that impact our ability to complete a project in accordance with the original delivery schedule. These difficulties may be the result of delays in designs, engineering information or materials provided by the customer or a third party, delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule changes, delays from our customer's failure to timely obtain permits or rights-of-way or meet other regulatory requirements, weather-related delays, delays caused by difficult worksite environments and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We also may encounter project delays due to local opposition, which may include injunctive actions as well as public protests, to the siting of electric transmission lines, pipelines or other facilities, especially those which are located in environmentally or culturally sensitive areas and more heavily populated areas. We may not be able to recover the costs we incur that are caused by delays. In certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of our schedules or performance requirements could also result in additional costs or penalties, including liquidated damages, and such amounts could exceed expected project profit. In extreme cases, the above-mentioned factors could cause project cancellations, and we may not be able to replace such projects with similar projects or at all. Such delays or cancellations may impact our reputation or relationships with customers, adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts.\nOur operations also involve a number of operational hazards. Natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, collisions and operator error could cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, equipment and the environment and suspension of operations. In locations where we perform work with equipment that is owned by others, our continued use of the equipment can be subject to unexpected or arbitrary interruption or termination. The occurrence of any of these events could result in work stoppage, loss of revenue, casualty loss, increased costs and significant liability to third parties.\nThe insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. An enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable.\nUnsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties, can affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs, negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover.\nWorkplace safety is important to us, our employees and our customers. As a result, we maintain comprehensive safety programs and training to all applicable employees throughout our organization. While we focus on protecting people and property, our work is performed at construction sites and in industrial facilities, and our workers are subject to the normal hazards associated with providing these services. Even with proper safety precautions, these hazards can lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We are intensely focused on maintaining a strong safety environment and reducing the risk of accidents to the lowest possible level.\nAlthough we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions to adequately train and equip our employees, we have experienced serious accidents, including fatalities, in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future. Serious accidents may subject us to penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may become liable for the obligations of our joint ventures and our subcontractors.\nSome of our projects are performed through joint ventures with other parties. In addition to the usual liability of contractors for the completion of contracts and the warranty of our work, where work is performed through a joint venture, we also have potential liability for the work performed by the joint venture itself. In these projects, even if we satisfactorily complete our project responsibilities within budget, we may incur additional unforeseen costs due to the failure of the joint ventures to perform or complete work in accordance with contract specifications.\nWe act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake. In our capacity as prime contractor and when acting as a subcontractor, we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract certain specialized activities such as hazardous waste removal, nondestructive inspection and catering and security. However, with respect to other contracts, including those in our Utility T&D segment, we may choose to subcontract a substantial portion of the project. In the construction industry, the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, when acting as a prime contractor, we are subject to the risks associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated.\nWe are self-insured against many potential liabilities.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability, general liability, workers\u2019 compensation and employee group health claims, many of those policies are subject to substantial deductibles, and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. Since most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies, we are effectively self-insured for the overwhelming majority of claims. We actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and noncurrent liabilities. The determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updated quarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity.\nOur operations expose us to potential environmental liabilities.\nOur U.S. and Canadian operations are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations which are complex and stringent. We regularly perform work in and around sensitive environmental areas, such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. Part of the business in our Utility T&D segment is performed in the southwestern U.S. where there is a greater risk of fines, work stoppages or other sanctions for disturbing Native American artifacts and archeological sites. Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage, without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. In addition to potential liabilities that may be incurred in satisfying these requirements, we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others or for our acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed.\nWe own and operate several properties in the United States and Canada that have been used for a number of years for the storage and maintenance of equipment and upon which hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released. Any release of substances by us or by third parties who previously operated on these properties may be subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), the Resource Compensation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d) and/or analogous state, provincial or local laws. CERCLA imposes joint and several liabilities, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment, while RCRA governs the generation, storage, transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes. Under these or similar laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes and clean up contaminated property. The expenses related to this work could have a significant impact on our future results.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. and Canada are oftentimes potentially subject to similar governmental or provincial controls and restrictions relating to the environment.\nWe are unable to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments.\nRecent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d may be contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. As a result, there have been a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced and/or issued in the United States (as well as other parts of the world) that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Although it is difficult to accurately predict how such legislation or regulations, including those introduced or adopted in the future, would impact our business and operations, it is possible that such laws and regulations could result in greater\ncompliance costs, capital spending requirements or operating restrictions for us and/or our customers and could adversely affect the demand for some of our services. We are also unable to predict how the outcome of the 2016 federal and state elections may affect any existing or proposed regulations or legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe may not be able to compete for, or work on, certain projects if we are not able to obtain any necessary bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financial assurances.\nOur contracts may require that we provide to our customers security for the performance of their projects in the form of bonds, letters of credit or other financial assurances. Current or future market conditions, including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies, as well as changes in our sureties' assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of, bid or performance bonds for our work. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our surety providers or lenders were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding or letters of credit, our alternatives would include seeking capacity from other sureties and lenders and finding more business that does not require bonds or allows for other form of collateral for project performance, such as cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all, which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances.\nFurthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our executive management.\nOur success depends heavily on the continued services of our executive management. Our management team is the nexus of our operational experience and customer relationships. Our ability to manage business risk and satisfy the expectations of our clients, stockholders and other stakeholders is dependent upon the collective experience and relationships of our management team. We do not maintain key man life insurance for these individuals.\nIn the past few years, we have experienced significant turnover at the senior management level. We believe that we currently have in place competitive compensation programs with strong retention incentives for our senior management. However, the loss or interruption of services provided by one or more of our senior officers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur ability to maintain our productivity and improve profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our strategy.\nWe contribute to multi-employer plans that could result in liabilities to us if those plans are terminated or we withdraw from those plans.\nWe contribute to several multi-employer pension plans for employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multi-employer plan in the event of the employer\u2019s withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. In addition, if the funding of any of these multi-employer plans becomes in \u201ccritical status\u201d under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we could be required to make significant additional contributions to those plans.\nA number of plans to which our business units contribute or may contribute in the future are in \u201cendangered\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. Certain of these plans may require additional contributions, generally in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future work performed by union employees covered by these plans. The amount of additional funds, if any, that we may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will likely be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of those union employees covered by these plans.\nOur settlements with the DOJ and the SEC may negatively impact us in the event of a future FCPA violation. Our failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn May 2008, after reaching agreement with the Company, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) filed an Information and Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d) concluding its investigation into violations of the FCPA by Willbros Group, Inc. and its subsidiary, Willbros International, Inc. Also in May 2008, we reached a final settlement with the SEC to resolve its previously disclosed investigations of possible violations of the FCPA and possible violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These investigations stemmed primarily from our former operations in Bolivia, Ecuador and Nigeria. We made the final payments under these settlements in October 2011. The criminal information associated with the DPA was dismissed, with prejudice, on April 2, 2012. Currently, we have no employees working outside of the United States and Canada.\nUnder the SEC settlement, we are permanently enjoined from committing any future violations of the federal securities laws.\nOur failure to abide by the FCPA and other laws could result in prosecution and other regulatory sanctions and severely impact our operations. A criminal conviction for violations of the FCPA could result in fines, civil and criminal penalties and equitable remedies, including profit disgorgement and injunctive relief, and would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSpecial risks associated with doing business in highly corrupt environments may adversely affect our business.\nOur international business operations may include projects in countries where corruption is prevalent. Since the anti-bribery restrictions of the FCPA make it illegal for us to give anything of value to foreign officials in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage, we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence.

While our Board of Directors has no present intention of authorizing the issuance of any such preferred stock, it reserves the right to do so in the future.", "PERMNO": 83834, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "WGRP"}
