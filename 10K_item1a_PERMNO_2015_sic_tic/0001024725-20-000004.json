{"cik": "1024725", "company": "TENNECO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.\nFuture deterioration or prolonged difficulty in economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, and liquidity.\nWe are a global company and, as such, our businesses are affected by economic conditions in the various geographic regions in which we do business. Economic difficulties generally lead to tightening of credit and liquidity. These conditions often lead to low consumer confidence or changes in consumer spending, which in turn may result in delayed and reduced purchases of durable goods such as automobiles and other vehicles. As a result, during difficult economic times our OE customers can significantly reduce their production schedules. For example, light vehicle production declined significantly during the economic crisis in 2008 and 2009 in North America and Europe. More recently, light vehicle and commercial vehicle production has declined significantly in South America in 2015 and 2016 and persistent challenges in the Chinese economy beginning in 2018 and continuing into 2020 may result in declining light vehicle and commercial vehicle production. Additionally, production of off-highway equipment with our content on them have been weak in certain product applications, such as agricultural and construction equipment in North America and Europe. Any deterioration or prolonged difficulty in economic conditions in any region in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and liquidity.\nIn addition, economic difficulties often lead to disruptions in the financial markets, which may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit which could materially and negatively affect our company. Future disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our customers\u2019 and our ability to access the liquidity that is necessary to fund operations on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nIn addition, financial or other difficulties at any of our major customers could have a material adverse impact on us, including as a result of lost revenues, significant write downs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges or additional restructuring beyond our current global plans. Severe financial or other difficulties at any of our major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on us if we are unable to obtain on a timely basis on similar economic terms the quantity and quality of components we require to produce our products.\nMoreover, severe financial or operating difficulties at any light vehicle or commercial vehicle manufacturer or other supplier could have a significant disruptive effect on the entire industry, leading to supply chain disruptions and labor unrest, among other things. These disruptions could force original equipment manufacturers and, in turn, other suppliers, including us, to shut down production at plants. While the issues that our customers and suppliers face during economic difficulties may be primarily financial in nature, other difficulties, such as an inability to meet increased demand as conditions recover, could also result in supply chain and other disruptions.\nFactors that reduce demand for our products or reduce prices could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for and pricing of our products are subject to economic conditions and other factors present in the various domestic and international markets where our products are sold. Demand for our OE products is subject to the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are equipped with our parts. The level of new light vehicle, commercial truck and off-highway vehicle purchases is cyclical, affected by such factors as general economic conditions, interest rates and availability of credit, consumer confidence, patterns of consumer spending, industrial construction levels, fuel costs, government incentives, and vehicle replacement cycles. Consumer preferences and government regulations also impact the demand for new light vehicle purchases equipped with our products. For example, if consumers increasingly prefer electric vehicles, demand for the vehicles equipped with our clean air products would decrease.\nDemand for our aftermarket, or replacement, products varies based upon such factors as general economic conditions; the level of new vehicle purchases, which initially displaces demand for aftermarket products; the severity of winter weather, which increases the demand for certain aftermarket products; the number of vehicles in operation; and other factors, including the average useful life of parts and number of miles driven.\nThe highly cyclical nature of the automotive and commercial vehicle industry presents a risk that is outside our control and that cannot be accurately predicted. Decreases in demand for automobiles and commercial vehicles and vehicle parts generally, or in the demand for our products in particular, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we believe that increasingly stringent environmental standards for emissions have presented and will continue to present an important opportunity for us to grow our clean air product line. We cannot assure you, however, that environmental\nstandards for emissions will continue to become more stringent or that the adoption of any new standards will not be delayed beyond our expectations.\nWe are dependent on certain large customers for future revenue. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our revenues from any of these customers or the loss of market share by these customers could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe depend on major vehicle manufacturers for a substantial portion of our revenues. For example, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, General Motors and Ford accounted for 11% and 10% of our net sales. Following the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, we are increasingly dependent on certain major aftermarket customers for our revenues. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our revenues from any of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations by reducing cash flows and our ability to spread costs over a larger revenue base. We may experience decreased revenues from these customers for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: (i) in the case of our OE customers, loss of awarded platforms, reduced demand for our customers\u2019 products, and work stoppages or other disruptions impacting OE production, and (ii) in the case of our aftermarket customers, reduced or delayed consumer requirements and competition from other brands or lower-cost alternatives. Further, our aftermarket customers are generally able to change suppliers more quickly than OE customers, which exacerbates these risks with respect to our aftermarket business. For all of our customers, we face the risk of their failure to pay us for a variety of reasons, including their respective financial conditions.\nIn addition, our customers compete intensively against each other. The loss of market share by any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business unless we are able to achieve increased sales to other major customers.\nWe are subject to, and could be further subject to, government investigations or actions by other third parties.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that govern our business both in the United States and internationally, including antitrust laws, violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions. Responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nFor example, antitrust authorities in various jurisdictions are investigating possible violations of antitrust laws by multiple automotive parts suppliers, including Tenneco. In addition, Tenneco and certain of its competitors are currently subject to civil putative class action lawsuits in the United States, which allege anti-competitive conduct related to the activities subject to these investigations. More related lawsuits may be filed, including in other jurisdictions.\nWhile we have established a reserve that we believe is adequate to resolve Tenneco\u2019s antitrust matters globally, we cannot, however, assure you that the reserve will not change materially from time to time or that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe may be unable to realize sales represented by our awarded business, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe realization of future sales from awarded business is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that our OE customers will actually produce, the timing of that production and the mix of options that our OE customers and consumers may choose. For example, light vehicle production declined significantly during the economic crisis in 2008 and 2009 in North America and Europe. More recently, light vehicle and commercial truck production declined significantly in South America in 2015 and 2016 and persistent challenges in the Chinese economy in 2018 and going into 2020 may result in declining light and commercial vehicle production in the region. In addition to the risks inherent in the cyclicality of vehicle production, our customers generally have the right to replace us with another supplier at any time for a variety of reasons and have demanded price decreases over the life of awarded business. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will in fact realize any or all of the future sales represented by our awarded business. Any failure to realize these sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIn many cases, we must commit substantial resources in preparation for production under awarded OE business well in advance of the customer\u2019s production start date. In certain instances, the terms of our OE customer arrangements permit us to recover these pre-production costs if the customer cancels the business through no fault of our company. Although we have been successful in recovering these costs under appropriate circumstances in the past, we can give no assurance that our results of operations will not be materially impacted in the future if we are unable to recover these types of pre-production costs in the event of an OE customer\u2019s cancellation of awarded business.\nOur level of debt, which increased in amount and percentage of floating rate debt as a result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, makes us more sensitive to the effects of economic downturns; and provisions in our debt agreements could constrain our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOur leverage increased as a result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $3.5 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our new senior credit facility, $1.9 billion of outstanding notes and approximately $0.2 billion of other debt. In addition, as a result of the acquisition we have increased exposure to interest rate fluctuations because our percentage of floating rate debt increased.\nOur level of debt makes us more vulnerable to changes in our results of operations because a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to servicing our debt and is not available for other purposes and our level of debt could impair our ability to raise additional capital if necessary. Further increases in interest rates will increase the amount of cash required for debt service. Under the terms of our senior secured credit facility, the indentures governing our notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness, we are able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. The more we become leveraged, the more we, and in turn our security holders, become exposed to many of the risks described herein.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service, capital investment and working capital requirements, we may need to seek additional financing or sell assets. If we require such financing and are unable to obtain it, we could be forced to sell assets under unfavorable circumstances and we may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations.\nIn addition, our senior credit facility and our other debt agreements contain covenants that limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry, including limitations on our ability to:\n\u2022\ndeclare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or purchase other debt;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nmake loans, guarantees, acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\namend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions or asset sales; and\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt instruments, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nOur senior credit facility and other agreements governing financings we enter into from time to time require us to maintain certain financial ratios. Our senior credit facility and our other financing instruments require us to comply with various operational and other covenants. If there were an event of default under any of our financing instruments that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted financing could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that financing to be due and payable immediately (which, in turn, could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other financing arrangements). If such event occurs, the lenders under our senior credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets and we could lose access to our factoring and supply chain financing programs. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding financing instruments, either upon maturity or if accelerated, upon an event of default, or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those financing instruments. This would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations, and on our ability to affect our share repurchase and dividend programs. For example, we recently amended our senior credit agreement to relax the financial ratios we are required to maintain to facilitate operational flexibility in light of our outlook for the second half of 2020. Even though we are able to obtain that amendment in February 2020, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain an amendment on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, if required in the future.\nOur working capital requirements may negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nOur working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our customers\u2019 worldwide vehicle production and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we would look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under our borrowing arrangements to satisfy those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all.\nWe may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our initiatives to improve operating performance and generate cost savings and improvements.\nWe regularly implement strategic and other initiatives designed to improve our operating performance. Our inability to implement these initiatives in accordance with our plans or our failure to achieve the goals of these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on these initiatives to offset pricing pressures from our suppliers and our customers, as described above, as well as to manage the impacts of production cuts. Our implementation of announced initiatives is from time to time subject to legal challenge in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions (where applicable employment laws differ from those in the United States). Furthermore, the terms of our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our notes may restrict the types of initiatives we undertake. In the past we have been successful in obtaining the consent of our senior lenders where appropriate in connection with our initiatives. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to pursue, successfully implement or realize the expected benefits of any initiative or that we will be able to sustain improvements made to date.\nExchange rate fluctuations could cause a decline in our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to increased risk because we generate a significant portion of our net sales and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For example, where we have a greater portion of costs than revenues generated in a foreign currency, we are subject to risk if the foreign currency in which our costs are paid appreciates against the currency in which we generate revenue because the appreciation effectively increases our cost in that country.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of some of our operating entities are reported in foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported revenues and operating profit while depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and operating profit.\nWe do not generally seek to mitigate the impacts of currency through the use of derivative financial instruments. To the extent we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in that currency could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe hourly workforce in the industry in which we participate is highly unionized and our business could be adversely affected by labor disruptions in the United States or internationally.\nA portion of our hourly workforce in North America and the majority of our hourly workforce in other regions are unionized. Although we consider our current relations with our employees to be satisfactory, if major work disruptions were to occur, our business could be adversely affected by, for instance, a loss of revenues, increased costs or reduced profitability. We have not experienced a material labor disruption in our recent history, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material labor disruption at one of our facilities in the future in the course of renegotiation of our labor arrangements or otherwise.\nIn addition to the risk of a work stoppage at one of our facilities, labor disruptions at other domestic or international companies may have an adverse effect on us. In the United States, substantially all of the hourly employees of General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in North America and many of their other suppliers are represented by The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (\u201cUAW\u201d) under collective bargaining agreements. Internationally, certain vehicle manufacturers, their suppliers and their respective employees are also subject to labor agreements. In September 2019, General Motors hourly workers represented by the UAW went on strike, which affected the volumes at certain of our North American plants in the third quarter of 2019. Although the strike was resolved on October 25, 2019, the strike affected volumes in the fourth quarter of 2019 as well. A work stoppage or strike at one of our production facilities, at those of a customer, or impacting a supplier of ours or any of our customers, either domestically or internationally, could have an adverse impact on us by disrupting demand for our products or our ability to manufacture our products.\nFrom time to time we experience significant increases and fluctuations in raw materials pricing and increases in certain lead times; and future changes in the prices of raw materials or utility services, or future increases in lead times, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nSignificant increases in the cost of certain raw materials used in our products, mainly steel, oil and rubber, or the cost of utility services required to produce our products, to the extent they are not timely reflected in the price we charge our customers or are otherwise mitigated, could materially and adversely impact our results. For example, in March 2018, the current U.S. administration imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports and over the course of 2018 and\n2019, the U.S. government imposed additional tariffs on products from China. In addition, during 2017, carbon steel prices as well as raw material prices (such as ferrochrome, iron ore, scrap and coking coal) to produce carbon steel remained at high levels after the sharp increases in 2016. In addition, both the European Union as well as the United States continue to impose a variety of anti-dumping duties on carbon steel as well as stainless steel. This not only results in higher domestic pricing but limits opportunities in terms of off shore buying. Carbon steel prices in North America increased further in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the run-up to the mandated \u201c232 Section Investigations\u201d against the import deadline of mid-January 2018.\nWe attempt to mitigate price increases by evaluating alternative materials and processes, reviewing material substitution opportunities, increasing component sourcing and parts assembly in best cost countries, and strategically pursuing regional and global purchasing strategies for specific commodities. We also aggressively negotiate to recover these higher costs from our customers, and in some cases, such as with respect to steel surcharges, we have the contractual right to recover some or all of these higher costs from certain of our customers. However, if we are successful in recovering these higher costs, we may not receive that recovery in the same period that the costs were incurred and the benefit of the recovery may not be evenly distributed throughout the year.\nWe also continue to pursue productivity initiatives and other opportunities to reduce costs through restructuring activities. During periods of economic recovery, the cost of raw materials and utility services generally rise. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that we will not face further increased prices in the future or, if we do, whether our actions will be effective in containing them.\nBy entering into new product lines and employing new technologies, our ability to produce certain of these products may be constrained due to longer lead times for our facilities, as well as those of our suppliers. We attempt to mitigate the negative effects of these longer lead times by improving the accuracy of our long-term planning; however, we cannot provide any certainty that we will always be successful in avoiding disruptions to our delivery schedules.\nWe may incur costs related to product warranties, environmental and regulatory matters, legal proceedings and other claims, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we receive product warranty claims from our customers, pursuant to which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Vehicle manufacturers require their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and to be responsible for the operation of these component products in new vehicles sold to consumers. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We cannot assure you that costs associated with providing product warranties will not be material, or that those costs will not exceed any amounts reserved in our consolidated financial statements. For a description of our accounting policies regarding warranty reserves, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d included in Item 7.\nOur global operations subject us to extensive governmental regulations worldwide. Foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations may change from time to time and our compliance with new or amended laws and regulations in the future may materially increase our costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and competitive position. For example, we are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. Soil and groundwater remediation activities are being conducted at certain of our current and former real properties. We record liabilities for these activities when environmental assessments indicate that the remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. On this basis, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for the remediation activities at our current and former real properties for which we could be held responsible. Although we believe our estimates of remediation costs are reasonable and are based on the latest available information, the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to change as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required. In future periods, we could incur cash costs or charges to earnings if we are required to undertake remediation efforts as the result of ongoing analysis of the environmental status of our properties. In addition, violations of the laws and regulations we are subject to could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, as well as prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nWe also from time to time are involved in a variety of legal proceedings, claims or investigations. These matters typically are incidental to the conduct of our business. Some of these matters involve allegations of damages against us relating to environmental liabilities, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, taxes, employment matters or commercial or contractual disputes or allegations relating to legal compliance by us or our employees. For example, we are subject to a number of lawsuits initiated by a significant number of claimants alleging health problems as a result of exposure to asbestos. Many of these cases involve significant numbers of individual claimants. Many of these cases also involve numerous\ndefendants. As major asbestos manufacturers or other companies that used asbestos in their manufacturing processes continue to go out of business, we may experience an increased number of these claims.\nWe vigorously defend ourselves in connection with all of the matters described above. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements. In future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably to us. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental and Legal Contingencies\u201d included in Item 7.\nDevelopments relating to our intellectual property could materially impact our business.\nWe and others in our industry hold a number of patents and other intellectual property rights, including licenses, which are critical to our respective businesses and competitive positions. Notwithstanding our intellectual property portfolio, our competitors may develop similar or superior proprietary technologies. Further, as we expand into regions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others replicating our proprietary technologies increases, which could result in a deterioration of our competitive position. On occasion, we may assert claims against third parties who are taking actions that we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third party intellectual property rights. These claims, regardless of their merit or resolution, are frequently costly to prosecute, defend or settle and divert the efforts and attention of our management and employees. Claims of this sort also could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any such claim were to result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to take actions which may include: expending significant resources to develop or license non-infringing products; paying substantial damages to third parties, including to customers to compensate them for their discontinued use or replacing infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or cessation of the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or our competitive position.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions or security breaches, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur operations rely on a number of information technologies to manage, store, and support business activities. Some of these technologies are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. We have put in place a number of systems, processes, and practices designed to protect against the failure of our systems, as well as the misappropriation, exposure or corruption of the information stored thereon. Unintentional service disruptions or intentional actions such as intellectual property theft, cyber-attacks, unauthorized access or malicious software, may lead to such misappropriation, exposure or corruption if our, or our service providers\u2019, protective measures prove to be inadequate. Further, these events may cause operational impediments or otherwise adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and/or results of operations. We could also encounter violations of applicable law, contracts or reputational damage from the disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or our employees, customers or suppliers. In addition, the disclosure of non-public information could lead to the loss of our intellectual property and/or diminished competitive advantages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. In addition, evolving and expanding compliance and operational requirements under the privacy laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which took effect in May 2018, impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time or potential fines for non-compliance.\nWe may have difficulty competing favorably in the highly competitive light vehicle and commercial vehicle supplier industry.\nThe light vehicle and commercial vehicle supplier automotive parts industry is highly competitive. Although the overall number of competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation, we face significant competition within each of our major product areas, including from new competitors entering the markets which we serve. The principal competitive factors include price, quality, service, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, global presence and timely delivery. As a result, many suppliers have established or are establishing themselves in emerging, low-cost markets to reduce their costs of production and be more conveniently located for customers. Although we are also pursuing a best-cost country production strategy and otherwise continue to seek process improvements to reduce costs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete favorably in this competitive market or that increased competition will not have a material adverse impact on our business by reducing our ability to increase or maintain sales or profit margins.\nIn addition, our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to ours, adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions before we do, particularly in respect of potential transformative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions. As a result, our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products. These\ntrends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products. Failure to innovate and to develop or acquire products that capitalize on new technologies could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFurthermore, due to the cost focus of our major OE customers, we have been, and expect to continue to be, requested to reduce prices as part of our initial business quotations and over the life of OE vehicle platforms we have been awarded. We cannot be certain that we will be able to generate cost savings and operational improvements in the future that are sufficient to offset price reductions requested by existing OE customers and necessary to win additional business. OE customers also direct us to engage specific suppliers for component purchases not allowing us to leverage our own supply base and realize cost reductions on this directed spend.\nThe decreasing number of customers and suppliers in our industry could make it more difficult for us to compete favorably.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected because the customer base for our parts and services is decreasing in both the OE market and aftermarket. As a result, we are competing for business from fewer customers. Furthermore, consolidation among suppliers have resulted in fewer, larger suppliers who benefit from purchasing and distribution economies of scale. If we cannot achieve cost savings and operational improvements sufficient to allow us to compete favorably in the future with these larger companies, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur aftermarket sales may be negatively impacted by increasing competition from lower cost, private-label products.\nDistribution channels in the aftermarket have continued to consolidate and, as a result, our sales to large retail customers represent a significant portion of our aftermarket business. Private-label aftermarket products, which are typically manufactured at a lower cost, often containing little or no premium technology, and are branded with a store or other private-label brand, are increasingly available to these large retail customers. Our aftermarket business is facing increasing competition from these lower cost, private-label products and there is growing pressure to expand our entry-level product lines so that retailers may offer a greater range of price points to their consumer customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our aftermarket sales to these large retail customers or that increased competition from these lower cost, private-label aftermarket products will not have an adverse impact on our aftermarket business.\nIf the reputation of one or more of our leading brands is harmed, aftermarket sales may be negatively impacted.\nOur aftermarket sales are dependent on the reputation and success of our brands, including Monroe\u00ae, Champion\u00ae, \u00d6hlins\u00ae, MOOG\u00ae, Walker\u00ae, Fel-Pro\u00ae, Wagner\u00ae, Ferodo\u00ae, Rancho\u00ae, Thrush\u00ae, National\u00ae, Sealed Power\u00ae and others. Product liability claims or recalls could result in negative publicity that could harm the reputation of our brands. If one or more of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality or safety issues, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nImprovements in automotive parts are adversely affecting aftermarket demand for some of our products.\nThe average useful life of automotive parts has steadily increased in recent years due to innovations in products and technologies. The longer product lives allow vehicle owners to replace parts of their vehicles less often. As a result, a portion of sales in the aftermarket has been displaced. In addition, advancements in technology may lead to enhancements in aftermarket product performance that render our product obsolete. This has adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our aftermarket sales. Also, any additional increases in the average useful lives of automotive parts or other enhancements in aftermarket performance would further adversely affect the demand for our aftermarket products.\nIf we do not respond appropriately, the evolution towards connectivity, autonomy, shared mobility and electrification could adversely affect our business.\nThe light vehicle industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially viable, fully autonomous vehicle. Continued focus on environmental sustainability is increasing the expectations for the auto industry to develop more fuel-efficient solutions from consumers and governments worldwide. There has also been an increase in consumer preferences for car and ride sharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. These evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional light vehicle industry. Failure to innovate and to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to OE and consumer preferences could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in technology and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products.\nChanges in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues.\nWe cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development or production, and failure of products to operate properly. If we are unable to react to changes in the marketplace, including the potential introduction of technologies such as autonomous vehicles, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We and, following the planned separation of our businesses, each separate company may also encounter significant difficulties in completing the integration of Federal-Mogul's business.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability (and the ability of each separate company following the planned separation) (defined below) to realize the anticipated benefits of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition and on our (and each separate company\u2019s) ability to complete the integration of Federal-Mogul\u2019s business in an effective and efficient manner, which is and has been a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The integration process may disrupt business and, if we are unable to successfully complete the integration of Federal-Mogul\u2019s business, we (and each separate company) could fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and realize the anticipated benefits of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our (and each separate company\u2019s) business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the integration of Federal-Mogul may result in material unanticipated challenges, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and loss of customers and other business relationships. Additional integration challenges include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\nchallenges in learning day-to-day operations of a new business with new management and teams;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in sustaining achieved cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the Federal-Mogul Acquisition;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties post the integration of operations and systems, including the risk that information technology-enabled process transformations do not achieve the desired levels of process efficiency, customer satisfaction and/or expected business benefits;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe impact of potential liabilities we may be inheriting from Federal-Mogul; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating a geographically dispersed organization.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of anticipated revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, each of which could adversely affect our (and each separate company\u2019s) business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, even if the integration of Federal-Mogul\u2019s business is successful, we (and each separate company) may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, including the sustainability of synergies and cost savings; or realization of the sales and growth opportunities we identified. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in finalizing the integration process. All of these factors could cause reductions in earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition and negatively impact the price of shares of our class A common stock (or each separate company\u2019s stock). As a result, we cannot ensure the Transaction will result in the realization of the anticipated benefits and the sustainability of the synergies.\nAny acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition.\nWe may, from time to time, consider acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired businesses, the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers and suppliers. In addition, any acquisitions could involve the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we pursue or that such acquisitions, and the potential related synergies, will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow, or deliver any anticipated strategic benefits. Any such failure could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures, which have unique risks.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures. Our joint ventures are governed by mutually established agreements that we entered into with our partners, and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint ventures. There is a risk that our partners' objectives for the joint ventures may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential disagreements over management of the joint ventures. At some of our joint ventures, our joint venture partner is also affiliated with the largest customer of the joint venture, which may create a conflict between the interests of our partner and the joint venture. Also, our ability to sell our interest in a joint venture may be subject to contractual and other limitations.\nAdditional risks associated with joint ventures include our partners failing to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners, a change in the ownership of any of our partners and our limited ability to control compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks related to operating a multi-national company.\nWe have manufacturing and distribution facilities in many regions across six continents. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, a significant portion of our net sales were derived from operations outside North America. Current events including the possibility of renegotiated trade deals and international tax law treaties, create a level of uncertainty, and potentially increased complexity, for multi-national companies. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, international operations are subject to various risks which could have a material adverse effect on those operations or our business as a whole, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations, including those in countries with hyperinflationary economies;\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic conditions and labor issues;\n\u2022\nexposure to local political conditions, including the risk of seizure of assets by a foreign government;\n\u2022\nexposure to local social conditions, including corruption and any acts of war, terrorism or similar events;\n\u2022\nexposure to local public health issues and the resultant impact on economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\ninflation in certain countries;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of cash, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nretaliatory tariffs and restrictions limiting free movement of goods and an unfavorable trade environment, including as a result of political conditions and changes in the laws in the United States and elsewhere and as described in more details below; and\n\u2022\nrequirements for manufacturers to use locally produced goods.\nNatural disasters, local and global public health emergencies, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may affect our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend and could impact our business and our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot currently predict the extent to which the coronavirus outbreak will impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf any of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters (such as earthquakes, tornados, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons), public health crises (such as pandemics and epidemics), political crises (such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict), or other events outside of our control, our business and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending or the economy in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations and financial condition. For example, in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has resulted in plant closures in China, supply chain disruptions, restrictions on travel to China, and a decrease in consumer traffic in China. The coronavirus has spread to multiple countries around the world and we are carefully monitoring the potential impact of the coronavirus in these other countries. The impact to the supply chain as a result of the coronavirus outbreak could further impact production at our and our customers'\nsites in China, as well as affect production at our and our customers' sites outside of China. We presently believe the impact of lost production in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the coronavirus will be $150 million on value-add revenue and $50 million on EBITDA. However, the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread as of the date of this report and, accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which the coronavirus will ultimately affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nEntering new markets poses new competitive threats and commercial risks.\nAs we have expanded into markets beyond light vehicles, we expect to diversify our product sales by leveraging technologies being developed for the light vehicle segment. Such diversification requires investments and resources which may not be available as needed. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in leveraging our capabilities into new markets and thus, in meeting the needs of these new customers and competing favorably in these new markets. Further, a significant portion of our growth potential is dependent on our ability to increase sales to commercial truck and off-highway vehicle customers. While we believe that we can achieve our growth targets with the production contracts that have been or will be awarded to us, our future prospects will be negatively affected if those customers underlying these contracts experience reduced demand for their products, or financial difficulties.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets, which may become impaired in the future and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of long-lived assets, goodwill, and other identifiable intangibles assets, including customer relationships, trademarks and brand names, and developed technologies due to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. Long lived assets, goodwill, and other identifiable intangible assets were approximately $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, or 17% of our total assets. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, are required to be evaluated for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. If business conditions or other factors cause profitability and cash flows to decline, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events indicate it is warranted. Impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products sold by our business, and a variety of other factors. The amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in the event that long lived assets, goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets become impaired.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $501 million in net deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryovers and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Each quarter, we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results and expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the risk factors described herein or other factors, we may be required to further adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nOur expected annual effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in mix of earnings and other factors.\nOur overall effective tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of our total profit or loss before tax. However, tax expenses and benefits are determined separately for each tax paying entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each jurisdiction. Losses in certain jurisdictions may provide no current financial statement tax benefit. As a result, changes in the mix of profits and losses between jurisdictions, among other factors, could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate.\nChanges in tax law or trade agreements and new or changed tariffs could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions and/or changes in laws and policies governing U.S. tax laws, foreign trade (including trade agreements and tariffs), manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we and/or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and business.\nFor example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed into law new legislation that significantly revised the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of\n21%, a one-time transition tax on offshore earnings at reduced tax rates regardless of whether the earnings are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign dividends (subject to certain important exceptions), new taxes on certain foreign earnings, a new minimum tax related to payments to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, immediate deductions for certain new investments as opposed to deductions for depreciation expense over time, and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits.\nIn addition, the United States, Mexico and Canada have renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). The revised agreement, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d), contains new and revised provisions that alter the prior rules governing when imports and exports of autos and auto parts are eligible for duty-free treatment. Generally, these new rules require a higher percentage of the overall content of the auto or autopart to originate in one of the USMCA's countries (the U.S., Mexico or Canada). The U.S. Congress has approved the USMCA, and the President signed it into law on January 29, 2020. The USMCA will go into effect 90 days after it is ratified by Canada. Our manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada are dependent on duty-free trade within the USMCA region. We have significant movement of goods within NAFTA region, and the imposition of customs duties on imports could negatively impact our financial performance.\nMoreover, in March 2018, the U.S. government imposed a 25% ad valorem tariff on certain steel imports and a 10% ad valorem tariff on certain aluminum imports. These tariffs (known as \u201cSection 232 tariffs\u201d) apply to certain steel and aluminum imports from almost all countries. In addition, over the course of 2018 and 2019, the U.S. government imposed additional tariffs on products from China valued at $550 billion (with some limited exceptions). As of October 2, 2019, the additional ad valorem tariff will be 30% on $250 billion of those imports, with the remainder at 15% at the end of 2019. As a result of the tariffs, China and other countries have implemented retaliatory actions with respect to U.S. imports into their countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurther, in May 2019, the U.S. President determined that imported automobiles and automotive parts pose a national security threat to the United States. While no additional tariffs have been imposed due to this decision (due to on-going international discussions), certain aspects of our business depend on the importation of automotive parts from outside of the U.S. If these or other similar tariffs are imposed, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company's pension obligations and other postretirement benefits assumed as a result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating margins and cash flows.\nFollowing completion of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have increased. The automotive industry, like other industries, continues to be affected by the rising cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits. In addition, the Company sponsors certain defined benefit plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments. If the performance of the assets in the pension plans does not meet the Company\u2019s expectations, or other actuarial assumptions are updated, the Company\u2019s required contributions may be higher than it expects.\nThe Company\u2019s hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs.\nIn order to mitigate short-term variation in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations, the Company hedged a portion of near-term exposure to certain raw materials used in production processes, primarily copper, nickel, tin, zinc, high-grade aluminum and aluminum alloy. The results of this hedging practice could be positive, neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures.\nOur hedging activities are not designed to mitigate long-term commodity price fluctuations and, therefore, will not protect from long-term commodity price increases. Our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw materials costs, which would accelerate the recognition in our operating results of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions.\nIf we cannot attract, retain, and motivate employees, we may be unable to compete effectively, and lose the ability to improve and expand our businesses.\nOur success and ability to grow depends, in part, on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and expand our business in many locations around the world. We face intense competition for highly qualified, specialized technical, managerial and other personnel. Recruiting, training, retention, and benefit costs place significant demands on our resources. The inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of key management employees or a significant number of our employees could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As disclosed in Part II, Item 8, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as we did not maintain a sufficient complement of resources in our North America Motorparts business to ensure that appropriate controls were designed, maintained and executed, including controls over account reconciliations and manual journal entries, related to the integration of a previously acquired entity within the North America Motorparts business. During 2019, the continued integration of the Federal-Mogul acquisition increased the complexity and level of certain financial reporting activities within the North America Motorparts business, without a corresponding change in centralized resource levels. A material weakness (as defined in Rule 12b-2) is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this material weakness, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in \u201cInternal Control-An Integrated Framework (2013).\u201d We have designed, and are implementing, a remediation plan to address this material weakness. If remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses in internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.\nRisks Relating to the Planned Separation of our Businesses\nThe planned separation of our businesses is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.\nFollowing the closing of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to pursue the separation of the combined company to form two new, independent, publicly traded companies, a new Powertrain Technology company (\u201cNew Tenneco\u201d) and an Aftermarket and Ride Performance company (\u201cDRiV\u201d). During 2020, we will be focused on the execution of our accelerated performance improvement plan to facilitate the expected separation of New Tenneco and DRiV. Current end-market conditions are affecting our ability to complete a separation in the mid-year 2020 time range. We expect that these trends will continue throughout this year. We have made significant progress to facilitate the planned spin-off of the DRiV business and have completed all necessary system and process components required for New Tenneco and DRiV to operate independently. In this respect, we are ready to separate the businesses as soon as favorable conditions are present. In order to facilitate the separation, we continue to evaluate multiple strategic alternatives, as well as options to deleverage and mitigate the ongoing impact of challenging market conditions.\nThe planned spin-off is intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance that the planned Spin-Off or other separation of our businesses will be completed at all or that the planned spin-off will be tax-free for U.S. federal income purposes. We expect that the process of completing the planned separation will be time consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate and may not yield a benefit if the planned separation is not completed. We may encounter unforeseen impediments to the completion of the planned separation that render it impossible or impracticable.\nIf the planned separation is not completed, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and the market price of our class A common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the planned separation will be completed. If the completion of the planned separation is delayed, including by the receipt of an acquisition proposal, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe planned separation could adversely affect our business, financial results and operations.\nThe planned separation of our businesses could cause disruptions and create uncertainty surrounding our business and affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees.\nAs a result of planned separation, some customers, suppliers or strategic partners may terminate their business relationship with us. Potential customers, suppliers or strategic partners may delay entering into, or decide not to enter into, a business relationship with us because of planned separation. If customer or supplier relationships or strategic alliances are adversely affected by the planned separation, our (and each separate company\u2019s after the planned separation) business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans. Our success after and in implementing the planned separation depends in part upon the ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of the Company may experience uncertainty about their roles with either separate company following the planned separation, or concerns regarding operations following the separation, any of which may have an adverse effect on the ability to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we (or each separate company after the planned separation) will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees to the extent that we have previously been able to attract or retain such employees.\nIn addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources to complete the planned separation, which could adversely impact our ability to manage existing operations or pursue alternative strategic transactions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe planned separation of our businesses may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits.\nWe may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from the planned separation of our businesses. As new independent companies, the two companies will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus. As a result, the two companies may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could result in increased volatility in their cash flows, working capital and financing requirements and could have a material adverse effect on the respective business, financial condition and results of operations of each company. Further, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the planned separation not occurred.\nIf the planned separation is completed, each separate company following the separation may underperform relative to our expectations.\nIf the planned separation is completed, each separate company may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we achieved or might achieve as a combined company. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of each separate company.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the planned separation that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs in connection with integrating the business and operations of Federal-Mogul with our business and operations and effectuating the planned separation. We may also incur additional unanticipated costs in the separation processes. These could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, or the business, financial condition and results of operations of each company following the planned separation, in the period in which such expenses are recorded, or the cash flows, in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.\nFurthermore, we and each company following the planned separation may incur material restructuring charges in connection with integration activities or the planned separation, which may adversely affect operating results for the period in which such expenses are recorded, or cash flows in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.\nWe may incur greater costs following the planned separation of our businesses, which could decrease our profitability.\nOur businesses are operating in conjunction with one another, allowing us in certain circumstances to take advantage of the combined businesses\u2019 size and purchasing power in procuring certain goods and services. After the planned separation of our businesses we may be unable to obtain goods and services at prices or on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained prior to the planned separation. Our businesses also benefit from certain shared functions and services. Following the planned separation, we will retain some of these functions and services, and DRiV Incorporated will retain some of these functions and services.\nWe could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions to transition information technology infrastructure in connection with the planned separation.\nWe may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if we and DRiV cannot transition effectively from the existing transactional and operational systems and data centers retained by the other, or from the transition services that support these functions. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, and we may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. Our failure to avoid operational interruptions as we implement any necessary new systems, our failure to implement any new systems and replace services successfully, or the insufficiency of our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities in the event of a disruption of our information technology services, could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, if we are unable to replicate or transition certain systems, our ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired.\nDRiV may not satisfy its obligations under various agreements that have been or will be executed as part of the planned spin-off.\nIn connection with the planned spin-off, we and DRiV will enter various agreements that govern the allocation of assets and liabilities between the two company and other matters. Included among these agreements will be a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Intellectual Property Matters Agreement and certain other agreements. Certain of these agreements will provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the planned spin-off. We will rely on DRiV to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If DRiV is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses.\nThere could be significant liability if the planned spin-off is determined to be a taxable transaction.\nA condition to the planned spin-off is our receipt of an opinion from certain tax advisors with respect to certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the DRiV spin-off, each of which is in substance and form satisfactory to us. The opinion is expected to conclude that the planned spin-off of 100% of the outstanding DRiV shares to our stockholders and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to us and our stockholders under Sections 355 and 368 of the Internal Revenue Code, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of DRiV\u2019s common stock. Any such opinion is not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to DRiV that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. The opinion will rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and DRiV regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters, which, if incomplete, incorrect or not satisfied, could alter the conclusions of the party giving such opinion or ruling.\nIf the planned spin-off ultimately is determined to be taxable, the spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and our stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, we would recognize a taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of DRiV common stock exceeds our tax basis in such stock on the date of the planned Spin-Off. The Tax Matters Agreement we will enter into with DRiV will address which company is responsible for any taxes imposed as a result of the planned Spin-Off.\nOur current stockholders may have reduced ownership and voting interests following the exercise of certain rights under the Purchase Agreement and exercise less influence over management.\nWe have granted certain registration rights to AEP for the resale of the shares issued in connection with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. These registration rights would facilitate the resale of such shares into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for public trading. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIf AEP transfers any shares of its Class B Common Stock to a third-party, the shares of Class B Common Stock so transferred will automatically convert in shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, if we do not consummate (or abandon) the proposed Spin-Off by April 1, 2020, each holder of Class B Common Stock may convert a number of such shares into an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock, provided that such conversion would not result in such holder, AEP, IEH, IEP and any of their affiliates owning, in the aggregate, more than 15 percent of the Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately following such conversion. If AEP transfers any shares of its Class B Common Stock to a third party, or if AEP converts its shares following April 1, 2020, our current stockholders will experience a proportionate reduction in voting power.\nOur business could be adversely impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders, including potential proxy contests.\nWe value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our stockholders regarding strategy and performance. The Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders. There can be no assurance, however, that the actions taken by the Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful, and we may be subject to formal or informal actions or requests from stockholders or others. Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention and resources of management and employees, and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flow and the market price of our common stock.\nUncertainties related to, or the results of, any actions by activist stockholders could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given as to the outcome or timing of any matters relating to actions by activist stockholders or the ultimate impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 84375, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "TEN"}
