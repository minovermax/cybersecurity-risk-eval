{"cik": "1609702", "company": "CDK Global, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our Company in each of the noted risk categories: (i) Risks Relating to Our Business; (ii) Risks Relating to Our Separation from ADP; and (iii) Risks Relating to Our Common Stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nMarket trends influencing the automotive retail industry could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMarket trends that negatively impact the automotive retail industry may affect our business by reducing the number and/or size of actual or potential clients or the money that actual or potential clients are willing or able to spend on our solution portfolio. Such market factors include:\n\u2022\nthe adverse effect of long-term unemployment on the number of vehicle purchasers;\n\u2022\npricing and purchase incentives for vehicles;\n\u2022\ndisruption in the available inventory of vehicles;\n\u2022\nthe expectation that consumers will be purchasing fewer vehicles overall during their lifetime as a result of better quality vehicles and longer warranties;\n\u2022\nthe cost of gasoline and other forms of energy;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of credit to finance the purchase of vehicles;\n\u2022\nincreased federal and other taxation; and\n\u2022\nreductions in business and consumer confidence.\nAdditionally, due to the most recent economic downturn, there was a substantial decline in 2009 and 2010 in the number of franchised automotive retailer locations in countries where the retail automotive marketplace is considered \u201cmature,\u201d most notably in North America and Western Europe. Although these declines have stabilized in North America, and the pace of declines in Western Europe has slowed, a further reduction in the number of automotive retailer locations would reduce the number of opportunities we have to sell our solutions. Additionally, auto retailers that close or otherwise scale back their businesses may not be willing or able to pay amounts owed to us. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to continue to compete effectively against other providers of integrated solutions to automotive retailers, OEMs, and other participants in the automotive retail industry.\nCompetition among automotive retail solutions and digital marketing solutions providers is intense. The industry is highly fragmented and subject to changing technology, shifting client needs, and frequent introductions of new solutions. We have a variety of competitors both for our integrated solutions and for each of our individual solutions. For example:\n\u2022\nour Automotive Retail business competes with integrated providers of automotive retailing technology solutions, such as Reynolds and Reynolds Company, Dealertrack Technologies (Cox Automotive), RouteOne LLC, AutoTrader, and Dominion Enterprises; and\n\u2022\nour Digital Marketing business competes with integrated providers of automotive digital marketing/advertising solutions, such as Dealertrack Technologies (Cox Automotive), AutoTrader, Dominion Enterprises, and Reynolds and Reynolds Company.\nOur competitors may be able to respond more quickly or effectively to new or emerging technologies and changes in client demands or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their solutions than we can to ours. We expect the industry to continue to attract new competitors and new technologies, possibly involving alternative technologies\nthat are more sophisticated and cost-effective than our solutions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges in regulations or consumer concerns regarding privacy and protection of consumer data, or any failure to comply with privacy and data protection obligations, could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFederal laws and regulations governing privacy and security of consumer information generally apply to our clients and/or to us as a service provider. These include the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the GLB Act and regulations implementing its information safeguarding requirements, the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Do-Not-Call-Implementation Act, applicable Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d) telemarketing rules, and the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) Privacy Rule, Safeguards Rule, Consumer Report Information Disposal Rule, Telemarketing Sales Rule, Risk-Based Pricing Rule, and Red Flags Rule. International laws, such as the European Union\u2019s Data Protection Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive, similarly apply to our collection, storage, use, and transmission of protected data.\nIn addition, many U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have passed, or are currently contemplating, a variety of consumer protection, privacy, and data security laws and regulations that may relate to our business. For example, some state legislatures and regulatory agencies have imposed, and others may impose, greater restrictions on the disclosure of the data we collect, use or transmit than are already contained in federal laws such as the GLB Act and its implementing regulations or the FTC rules described above. Similarly, it is possible that in the future, U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may adopt legislation or regulations that impair our ability to effectively track consumers\u2019 use of our digital marketing services, such as the FTC\u2019s proposed \u201cDo-Not-Track\u201d standard or other legislation or regulations similar to European Union Directive 2009/136/EC, commonly referred to as the \u201cCookie Directive,\u201d which directs EU member states to ensure that accessing information on an Internet user\u2019s computer, such as through a cookie, is allowed only if the Internet user has given his or her consent.\nThe costs and other burdens of compliance with privacy and data security laws and regulations could negatively impact the use and adoption of our solutions and reduce overall demand for them. Additionally, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our clients, or their customers and potential customers, to resist providing the data necessary to allow us to deliver our solutions effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our solutions and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could lead to significant fines, penalties or other liabilities. Any such decrease in demand or incurred fines, penalties or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are directly and indirectly subject to, and impacted by, extensive and complex regulation in the U.S. and abroad, and new regulations and/or changes to existing regulations may negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business is directly and indirectly subject to, and impacted by, numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our operations increases our costs and may impede our competitiveness. In addition, failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our ability to do business in applicable jurisdictions or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines or exposure to civil litigation.\nIn addition to the data privacy and security laws and regulations mentioned above, our business is also directly or indirectly governed by domestic and international laws and regulations relating to issues such as telecommunications, anti-trust or competition, employment, vehicle registration, advertising, taxation, consumer protection, and accessibility. We must also comply with anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and private entities, such as the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act. The application of this framework of laws and regulations to our business is complex and, in many instances, is unclear or unsettled, which in turn increases our cost of doing business, may interfere with our ability to offer our solutions competitively in one or more jurisdictions and may expose us and our employees to potential fines, penalties or other enforcement actions. In some cases, our clients may seek to impose additional requirements on our business in efforts to comply with their interpretation of their own or our legal obligations. These requirements may differ significantly from our existing solutions or processes and may require engineering and other costly resources to accommodate.\nOur failure to comply, or to provide solutions that allow our clients to comply, with any of the foregoing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nNew legislation or changes in existing legislation regarding the Internet may negatively impact our business.\nOur ability to conduct, and our cost of conducting, our business may be negatively impacted by a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning various aspects of the Internet, which are currently under consideration by federal, state, local, and foreign governments, administrative agencies such as the FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the FCC, and various courts. These proposals include regulation of the following matters, among others: on-line content, user privacy, taxation, access charges and so-called \u201cnet-neutrality\u201d liability of third-party activities and jurisdiction. Moreover, we do not know how existing laws relating to these or other issues will be applied to the Internet. The adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws could decrease the growth in the use of the Internet, which could in turn decrease the demand for our solutions that are provided via the Internet, increase our costs of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. During 2010, the FCC imposed rules of nondiscrimination and transparency, commonly referred to as the \"net-neutrality\" rules, upon wireline broadband providers. Similar transparency requirements were imposed on wireless broadband providers, in addition to prohibitions from blocking websites and applications that compete with voice and video telephony services. The FCC\u2019s 2010 net-neutrality rules have been challenged in Federal courts and on January 14, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC\u2019s transparency rule, but vacated both the nondiscrimination and anti-blocking rules. In response, on February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted new net-neutrality rules, which are expected to be released to the public and become effective later in 2015. Based upon information that has been publicly issued by the FCC, the new rules will, among other things, prohibit broadband providers from blocking or impairing lawful services and devices, ban paid prioritization of certain lawful Internet traffic over others, and impose expanded transparency requirements. These new rules will apply equally to wireline and wireless broadband providers. It is uncertain whether these new net neutrality rules will be challenged in the courts and, if challenged, whether they will be upheld. In the event that these new net-neutrality rules are not upheld it is possible that we may have to pay premium rates to providers for wireline and wireless broadband services. Even if the new net neutrality rules survive court challenges, it is uncertain how these rules may be interpreted and enforced by the FCC; therefore, we cannot predict the practical effect of these rules and related proceedings on our ability to conduct, and our cost of conducting, our business.\nReal or perceived errors or failures in our software and systems could negatively impact our results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe depend upon the sustained and uninterrupted performance of numerous proprietary and third-party technologies to deliver our solution portfolio. If one or more of those technologies cannot scale to meet demand, or if there are errors in our execution of any feature or functionality using any such technologies, then our business may be harmed. Because our software is often complex, undetected errors and failures may occur, especially when new versions or updates are made. Despite testing by us, errors or bugs in our solutions may not be found until the software or service is in active use by us or our clients. Moreover, our clients could incorrectly implement or inadvertently misuse our solutions, which could result in client dissatisfaction and adversely impact the perceived utility of our solutions as well as our brand. Any of these real or perceived errors, failures or bugs could result in negative publicity, reputational harm, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our solutions, loss of competitive position or claims by clients for losses sustained by them, all of which, along with the costs of responding to such effects, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur systems may be subject to security breaches.\nOur success depends on the confidence of OEMs, dealers, lenders, major credit reporting agencies and other data providers, and other users of (or participants in) our solutions in our ability to store, process, and transmit confidential information securely (whether over the Internet or otherwise), and to operate our computer systems and operations without significant disruption or failure. We transmit substantial amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information of consumers, over the Internet. Even if our security measures are adequate, concerns over the security of third-party data that we store, process and transmit, which may be heightened by any well-publicized compromise of security, may deter clients from using our solution portfolio and/or deter vendors from providing their solutions to us. Moreover, if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to confidential information, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure and our clients may curtail or stop using our solutions and/or vendors may curtail or stop providing their solutions to us. Any failure of, or lack of confidence in, the security of our solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Despite our focus on data security, we may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to data that we store and process, or to stop disruptions in the transmission or provision of data and communications or other data by us. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms used by our solutions to protect data\ncontained in our, our clients\u2019 and/or our vendors\u2019 databases and the information being stored, transferred, or processed. Although we generally limit warranties and liabilities relating to data and system security in our client and vendor contracts, they or other third parties may seek to hold us liable for any losses suffered as a result of unauthorized access to their confidential information or non-public personal information of consumers. In addition, we may not have limited our warranties and liabilities sufficiently or have adequate insurance to cover these losses. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches, and/or to alleviate any problems caused by actual or threatened security breaches. Our security measures may not be sufficient to prevent security breaches, and any failure to prevent security breaches and/or to adequately alleviate any problems caused by security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur networks and systems may be vulnerable to interruptions or failure.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, network or system slowdowns and interruptions. These network and system slowdowns and interruptions may interfere with our ability to do business. Although we believe we have made the appropriate upgrades to our various systems, regularly back up data, and take other measures to protect against data loss and system failures, there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience network failures. Such failures or disruptions may result in lost revenue opportunities for our clients, which could result in litigation against us or a loss of clients. Additionally, we have service level agreements with certain of our clients that may result in penalties or trigger cancelation rights in the event of a network or system slowdown or interruption. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business operations may be harmed by events beyond our control.\nOur business operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, such as fires, floods and hurricanes, or from power outages, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, computer network service outages and disruptions, \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks, computer viruses, break-ins, sabotage, and other similar events beyond our control. For example, the majority of our North American research and development activities, and the research and development and operations activities of our digital marketing business, are located near significant seismic faults in the Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington areas, respectively. The occurrence of any such event at any of our facilities or at any third-party facility utilized by us or our third-party providers could cause interruptions or delays in our business, loss of data, or could render us unable to provide our solution portfolio. In addition, any failure of a third-party to provide the data, products, services, or facilities required by us, as a result of human error, bankruptcy, natural disaster, or other operational disruption, could cause interruptions to our computer systems and operations. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may experience difficulties, delays, or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced business transformation plan.\nDuring the second half of fiscal 2015, we initiated a business transformation plan as described herein under the caption, \"Business Transformation Plan\" under Item 7 - \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits and savings from the business transformation plan due to unforeseen difficulties, delays, or unexpected costs, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations, and even if the anticipated benefits and savings are substantially realized, there may be consequences or business impacts that were not expected.\nWe utilize certain key technologies, data, and services from, and integrate certain of our solutions with, third parties and may be unable to replace those technologies, data, and services if they become obsolete, unavailable, or incompatible with our solutions.\nWe utilize certain key technologies and data from, and/or integrate certain of our solutions with, hardware, software, services, and data of third parties, including Chrome Systems, TrueCar, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, EMC, Cisco Systems, Kyocera, Experian, Equifax, TransUnion and others. Some of these vendors are also our competitors in various respects. These third-party vendors could, in the future, seek to charge us cost-prohibitive fees for such use or integration or may design or utilize their solutions in a manner that makes it more difficult for us to continue to utilize their solutions, or integrate their technologies with our solutions, in the same manner or at all. Any significant interruption in the supply or maintenance of such third-party hardware, software, services or data could negatively impact our ability to offer our solutions unless and until we replace the functionality provided by this third-party hardware, software and/or data. In addition, we are dependent upon these third parties\u2019 ability to enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. There can be no assurance that we would be able to replace the\nfunctionality or data provided by third-party vendors in the event that such technologies or data becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our solutions or are otherwise not adequately maintained or updated. Any delay in or inability to replace any such functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, delays in the release of new and upgraded versions of third-party software applications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMarket acceptance of and influence over our products and services, particularly in our Digital Marketing business, is concentrated in a limited number of automobile OEMs and consolidated retailer groups, and we may not be able to maintain or grow these relationships.\nAlthough the automotive retail industry is fragmented, a relatively small number of OEMs, consolidated retailer groups and retailer associations exert significant influence over the market acceptance of automotive retail products and services due to their concentrated purchasing activity, their endorsement or recommendation of specific products and services and/or their ability to define technical standards and certifications. For example, our DMSs are certified to technical standards established by OEMs and certain of our products and services are provided pursuant to OEM-designated endorsement or preferred vendor programs. While automotive retailers are generally free to purchase the solutions of their choosing, when an OEM has endorsed or certified a provider of products or services to its associated franchised automotive retailers and if our solutions lack such certification or endorsement, adoption or retention of our products and services among the franchised dealers of such OEM could be materially impaired.\nSome of our products, such as our digital marketing solutions, are primarily sold to or through OEMs and depend on us maintaining strong relationships with those OEMs. Our digital marketing solutions are primarily marketed and delivered through programs sponsored or endorsed by OEMs, the most significant of which is General Motors. We generated approximately 10% of our consolidated and combined revenues from General Motors during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. OEM switching costs for digital marketing solutions are generally low and our agreements with such clients generally may be terminated by each OEM on short notice or without cause. The termination of one or more of these relationships, changes in our clients\u2019 advertising budget allocations or marketing strategies, or a change in the economy could result in a decline in the level of digital marketing services that they purchase from us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have clients in over 100 countries, where we are subject to country-specific risks that could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we generated 20% of our revenues outside of the United States, and we expect revenues from other countries to continue to represent a significant part of our total revenues in the future. Business and operations in individual countries are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, currency exchange controls, and repatriation of earnings. Our results are also subject to the difficulties of coordinating our activities across the countries in which we are active. In addition, our operations in each country are vulnerable to changes in socio-economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies, intellectual property protection disputes, the settlement of legal disputes through foreign legal systems, the collection of receivables through foreign legal systems, exposure to possible expropriation or other governmental actions, unsettled political conditions, possible terrorist attacks, and pandemic disease. These and other factors relating to our international operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur indebtedness could negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nIn connection with our spin-off from ADP, we entered into debt financing arrangements and borrowed $250.0 million under our term loan facility and $750.0 million under our bridge loan facility. Additionally, we entered into a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, which was undrawn as of June 30, 2015. On October 14, 2014, we completed an offering of 3.30% senior notes with a $250.0 million aggregate principal amount due in October 2019 and 4.50% senior notes with a $500.0 million aggregate principal amount due in October 2024, the net proceeds of which, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the bridge loan facility. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nany failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022\na portion of cash flows will be required to make payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities, and potential dividends to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nour indebtedness will make us more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022\nour indebtedness may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we may be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, reducing or discontinuing dividends we may pay in the future, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nOur indebtedness and debt service obligations will effectively reduce the amount of funds available for other business purposes and may adversely affect us.\nCosts related to the notes are substantial, and our level of indebtedness, including any future borrowings under our revolving credit facility, could reduce funds available for acquisitions, capital expenditures or other business purposes, impact our credit ratings, restrict our financial and operating flexibility, or create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with lower debt levels. Further, increased indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed by negative rating actions by credit rating agencies.\nOur long-term debt has an investment grade rating. If our initial rating is downgraded or if ratings agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged. Any of these outcomes could also negatively impact our relationships with our clients, increase our costs of borrowing, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our key management, direct sales force, and technical personnel for continued success.\nOur global senior management team is concentrated in a small number of key members, and our future success depends to a meaningful extent on the services of our executive officers and other key team members, including members of our direct sales force and technology staff. Generally, our executive officers and employees can terminate their employment relationship at any time. The loss of any key employees or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel could materially harm our business and prospects.\nWe rely primarily on our direct sales force to sell our products and services to automotive retailers and OEMs. We expect that we will need to hire additional sales, customer service, integration and training personnel in the near-term and beyond if we are to achieve revenue growth in the future. If we fail to attract qualified and productive sales and service personnel, or if we suffer unanticipated losses of such personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCompetition for qualified personnel in the technology industry is intense, and we compete for technical personnel with other technology companies that have greater financial and other resources than we do. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical personnel, and there can be no assurance that we are able to do so. Any difficulty in hiring or retaining needed personnel, or increased costs related thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur revenue, operating results, and profitability will vary from quarter to quarter, which may result in volatility in our stock price.\nOur revenue, operating results, and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may lead to volatility in our stock price. These variations are due to several factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to timely and effectively implement our business transformation plan;\n\u2022\nthe timing, size, and nature of our client revenues (particularly with respect to our Digital Marketing business) and any losses with respect thereto;\n\u2022\nproduct and price competition regarding our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe timing of introduction and market acceptance of new products, services or product enhancements by us, or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nthe timing of acquisitions or divestitures of businesses, products, and services;\n\u2022\nthe seasonality of car sales;\n\u2022\npersonnel changes; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in economic and financial market conditions.\nIf our long-lived assets and goodwill become impaired we may be required to record a significant non-cash charge to earnings, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a long-term financial outlook of our operations. Actual performance in the near-term or long-term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact future estimates and the recorded value of long-lived assets.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is instead tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may impact our annual impairment test or constitute changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price, market capitalization, cash flow expectations, or slower growth rates in our industry. Estimates of future cash flows are based on long-term financial outlook of our operations.\nWe will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets and goodwill. In the event we have to recognize an impairment, any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to develop and bring products and services in development to market, or bring new products and services to market in a timely manner or at all.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to bring to market new products and services, and enhancements thereto that address evolving client demands. For example, our digital marketing solutions must effectively address the market shift to mobile technology. The time, expense, and effort associated with developing and offering new and enhanced products and services may be greater than anticipated. The length of the development cycle varies depending on the nature and complexity of the product, the availability of development, product management, and other internal resources and the role, if any, of strategic partners. If we are unable to develop and bring to market additional products and services, and enhancements thereto, in a timely manner, or at all, we could lose market share to competitors who are able to offer these new products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur failure or inability to execute any element of our business strategy, including our business transformation plan, could negatively impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition depend on our ability to execute our business strategy, which includes the following key elements:\n\u2022\nexecuting on our business transformation plan;\n\u2022\ndeepening relationships with our existing client base;\n\u2022\ncontinuing to expand our client base;\n\u2022\nstrengthening and extending our solutions portfolio;\n\u2022\ndriving additional operational efficiency; and\n\u2022\nselectively pursuing strategic acquisitions.\nWe may not succeed in implementing a portion or all of our business strategy, and even if we do succeed, our strategy may not have the favorable impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition that we anticipate. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our business or achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully avail ourselves of the market opportunity for our solution portfolio. If we are unable to adequately implement our business strategy, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could suffer a material adverse effect.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property, and other proprietary rights.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring certain of our team members and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition and assignment of inventions agreements. To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products and services similar to ours or use trademarks similar to ours. Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries in which we market our products and services afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, and we may not prevail. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or manage costs associated with enforcing those rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nClaims that we or our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party may require us to incur significant costs, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or develop or license substitute technology.\nWe have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims that our technologies in our products and services infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. In addition, the vendors providing us with technology that we use in our own technology could become subject to similar infringement claims. Although we believe that our products and services do not infringe any intellectual property or other proprietary rights, we cannot assure you that our products and services do not, or that they will not in the future, infringe intellectual property or other proprietary rights held by others. Any claims of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is without merit, and could distract our management from our business. Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from the claim could require us to pay substantial amounts, obtain a license to continue to use the products and services that are the subject of the claim, and/or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, from the third party asserting any particular claim, that we would be able to successfully develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all, or that we would be able to obtain a license from another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our clients to continue using, the products and services. In addition, we generally provide in our client agreements for certain products and services that we will indemnify our clients against third-party infringement claims relating to technology that we provide to those clients, which could obligate us to pay damages if the products and services were ever found to be infringing.\nInfringement claims asserted against us, our vendors or our clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions and formed strategic alliances in the past and expect to do so in the future. If we are unable to find suitable acquisitions or alliance partners that strengthen our value proposition to clients or to achieve the expected benefits from such acquisitions or alliances, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSince 2000, we have completed 31 acquisitions. These have ranged from acquisitions of small start-up companies that provide a discrete application to a handful of clients, to acquisitions of substantial companies with more mature solutions and a larger client base, such as our acquisition of Kerridge in 2005, which facilitated our international expansion, and our acquisition of Cobalt in 2010, which is the foundation of our Digital Marketing business. As part of our ongoing business strategy to expand solutions offerings, acquire new technologies, and strengthen our value proposition to clients, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding, and enter into agreements relating to, possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, and joint ventures. However, there may be significant competition for acquisition, alliance, and joint venture targets in our industry, or we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or negotiate attractive terms for such transactions in the future.\nEven if we are able to complete acquisitions or enter into alliances and joint ventures that we believe will provide attractive growth opportunities, such transactions are inherently risky. Significant risks from these transactions include risks relating to:\n\u2022\nintegration and restructuring costs, both one-time and ongoing;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and maintaining sufficient controls, policies, and procedures;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations;\n\u2022\nestablishing new informational, operational, and financial systems to meet the needs of our business;\n\u2022\nlosing key employees, clients, and vendors;\n\u2022\nfailing to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary solutions; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated or unknown liabilities.\nIf we are not successful in completing acquisitions in the future, we may be required to reevaluate our acquisition strategy. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete acquisitions. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash to pay all or a portion of the purchase prices of future acquisitions. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by our management and financial or industry analysts, others may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do. If these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future acquisitions may involve the issuance of our equity securities as payment, in part or in full, for the businesses or assets acquired, which would dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interests. Future acquisitions may also decrease our earnings or earnings per share and the benefits derived by us from an acquisition might not outweigh or exceed the dilutive effect of the acquisition. We also may incur additional indebtedness, have future impairment of assets or suffer adverse tax and accounting consequences in connection with any future acquisitions.\nWe could be sued for contract or product liability claims, and such lawsuits may disrupt our business, divert management\u2019s attention, or have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe provide limited warranties to purchasers of our products and services. In addition, errors, defects or other performance problems in our products and services, including with respect to data that we store, process and provide in connection with our products and services, could result in financial or other damages to our clients or consumers. There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability set forth in our contracts would be enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions in excess of the applicable deductible amount; however, there can be no assurance that this coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or at all, or that the insurer will not deny coverage for any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us and divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, some of our products and services are business-critical for our clients, and a failure or inability to meet a client\u2019s expectations could seriously damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to retain existing business or attract new business.\nBecause we recognize revenue from our subscription-based products and services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from sales of our subscription-based products and services ratably over the term of the subscription contract. As a result, the majority of our quarterly revenue is attributable to service contracts entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed service agreements in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue in that quarter but will harm our revenue in future quarters. Consequently, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our subscription services in a particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, because revenue from new subscription contracts, and from additional orders under existing subscription contracts, must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. In addition, delays or failures in deployment of our subscription services may prevent us from recognizing subscription revenue for indeterminate periods of time. Further, we may experience unanticipated increases in costs associated with providing our subscription services to clients over the term of our subscription contracts as a result of inaccurate internal cost projections or other factors, which may harm our operating results.\nWe may experience foreign currency gains and losses.\nWe conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar, Euro, Pound Sterling, and Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar, can significantly affect our assets, revenues, and operating results. Generally, our revenues are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. Similarly, cash, other bank deposits, and other assets held in foreign currency are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens.\nWe may implement a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with these foreign currency exposures that we may suspend from time to time. As a part of this program, we would enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. With respect to our international operations, we expect that we will realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from any foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures or if we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control.\nWe may have exposure to unanticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur global business operations will subject us to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. The computation of provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities is complex, as it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment regarding the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under GAAP. Provision for income taxes may require forecasts of effective tax rates for the year, which include assumptions and forward looking financial projections, including the expectations of profit and loss by jurisdiction. Various items cannot be accurately forecasted and future events may materially differ from our forecasts. Our provision for income tax can be materially impacted, for example, by the geographical mix of our profits and losses, changes in our business, such as internal restructuring and acquisitions, changes in tax laws and accounting guidance and other regulatory, legislative or judicial developments, tax audit determinations, changes in our uncertain tax positions, changes in our intent and capacity to permanently reinvest foreign earnings, changes to our transfer pricing practices, tax deductions attributed to equity compensation, and changes in our need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. For these reasons, our actual income taxes or other tax liabilities may be materially different than our provisions for anticipated tax obligations.\nIn addition, changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Further, in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nIn the event that changes in tax laws negatively impact our effective tax rates, our provision for taxes or generate unanticipated tax liabilities, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could suffer a material adverse effect.\nThere can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\nFrom time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although we believe that the sources of capital currently in place will permit us to finance our operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future or at all will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour financial performance;\n\u2022\nour credit ratings;\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of the overall capital markets; and\n\u2022\nthe state of the economy.\nThere can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\nRisks Relating to Our Separation from ADP\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience increased costs after the separation or as a result of the separation.\nWe have had to replicate certain facilities, systems, infrastructure and personnel to which we no longer have access after our separation from ADP. We also have had to make investments to operate without access to ADP\u2019s existing operational and administrative infrastructure. These initiatives are costly to implement. Due to the scope and complexity of the underlying projects, the amount of total costs cannot be estimated at this time.\nADP historically performed many important corporate functions for our operations, including information technology support, treasury, accounting, financial reporting, tax administration, human resource administration, procurement, security, real estate and other services prior to our separation. We paid ADP for these services on a cost-allocation basis. ADP continues to provide some of these services to us on a short-term, transitional basis, for which we pay ADP fees generally based on the applicable allocable cost of ADP\u2019s services to the Dealer Services business prior to the spin-off. As we operate these functions independently, if we do not have our own adequate systems and business functions in place, or are unable to obtain them from other providers, we may not be able to operate our business effectively or at comparable costs, and our profitability may decline.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject following the spin-off.\nOur financial results previously were included within the consolidated results of ADP, and our reporting and control systems were appropriate for those of subsidiaries of a public company. Prior to the spin-off, we were not directly subject to reporting and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result of the spin-off, we are directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. Further, beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016, we will be required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These and other obligations will place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting and IT resources.\nTo comply with these requirements, we continue to upgrade our systems, including computer hardware infrastructure, implementing additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hiring additional accounting, finance, and IT staff. We have, and will continue to incur additional annual expenses related to these steps, including with respect to, among other things, director and officer liability insurance, director fees, expenses associated with our SEC reporting obligations, transfer agent fees, increased auditing and legal fees, and similar expenses, which expenses may be significant. If we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls, reporting systems, IT systems, and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nBeing a public company subject to additional laws, rules and regulations has and will continue to require the investment of additional resources to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe spin-off could result in significant tax liability to ADP, and we could be required to indemnify ADP for such liability.\nADP obtained an opinion from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, its counsel, to the effect that, based on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings set forth in the opinion, the spin-off qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free under Section 355 and other related provisions of the Code. ADP also received a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") with respect to certain discrete and significant issues arising in connection with the transactions affected in connection with the spin-off.\nThe opinion and the ruling were based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by ADP and CDK. If any of those factual representations or assumptions are untrue or incomplete in any material respect, any undertaking is not complied with, or the facts upon which the opinion and the ruling were based are materially different from the facts at the time of the spin-off, the spin-off may not qualify for tax-free treatment. Although a private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS, the IRS did not rule that the spin-off satisfies every requirement for a tax-free distribution. Opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or the courts. As a result, the conclusions expressed in an opinion of counsel could be challenged by the IRS, and if the IRS prevails in such challenge, the tax consequences to you could be materially less favorable.\nIf the spin-off were determined not to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Code, each United States holder generally would be treated as receiving a distribution taxable as a dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of our common stock received by the holder. In addition, ADP generally would recognize gain with respect to the spin-off and certain related transactions, and we could be required to indemnify ADP for any resulting taxes and related expenses, which could be material.\nThe spin-off and certain related transactions could be taxable to ADP if CDK or its stockholders were to engage in certain transactions after the spin-off. In such cases, ADP and/or its stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could be required to indemnify ADP for any resulting taxes and related expenses, which could be material.\nWe are agreeing to certain restrictions to preserve the treatment of the spin-off as tax-free to ADP and its stockholders, which will reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nIf the spin-off fails to qualify for tax-free treatment as discussed above, it will be treated as a taxable dividend to ADP stockholders in an amount equal to the fair market value of our stock issued to ADP stockholders. In that event, ADP would be required to recognize a gain equal to the excess of the sum of the fair market value of our stock on the spin-off date and the amount of cash received in the cash distribution over ADP\u2019s tax basis in our stock.\nIn addition, current tax law generally creates a presumption that the spin-off would be taxable to ADP, but not to its stockholders, if we or our stockholders were to engage in a transaction that would result in a 50% or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership during the two-year period beginning on September 30, 2014, unless it is established that the spin-off and the transaction are not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. In the case of such a 50% or greater change in our stock ownership, tax imposed on ADP in respect of the spin-off would be based on the fair market value of our stock on the spin-off date over ADP\u2019s tax basis in our stock.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that we have entered into with ADP, we are generally prohibited, except in specified circumstances, for specified periods of up to 24 months following the spin-off, from\n\u2022\nissuing, redeeming or being involved in other significant acquisitions of our equity securities;\n\u2022\ntransferring significant amounts of our assets;\n\u2022\namending our certificate of incorporation or by-laws;\n\u2022\nfailing to engage in the active conduct of a trade or business; or\n\u2022\nengaging in certain other actions or transactions that could jeopardize the tax-free status of the spin-off.\nIn connection with our separation from ADP, we and ADP incurred potentially significant indemnity obligations. If we are required to act on these indemnities to ADP, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In the case of ADP\u2019s indemnity, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that ADP will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that we have entered into with ADP, we agreed generally to indemnify ADP for taxes and related losses it suffers as a result of the spin-off failing to qualify as a tax-free transaction, if the taxes and related losses are attributable to:\n\u2022\ndirect or indirect acquisitions of our stock or assets (regardless of whether we consent to such acquisitions);\n\u2022\nnegotiations, understandings, agreements, or arrangements in respect of such acquisitions; or\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with certain representations and undertakings from us, including the restrictions described in the preceding risk factor.\nOur indemnity will cover both corporate level taxes and related losses imposed on ADP in the event of a 50% or greater change in our stock ownership described in the preceding risk factor, as well as taxes and related losses imposed on both ADP and its stockholders if, due to our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated, the spin-off is determined to be taxable for other reasons.\nIndemnities that we may be required to provide ADP may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, particularly indemnities relating to certain actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the spin-off. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ADP has agreed to retain. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from ADP will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that ADP will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from ADP any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe potentially could have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with ADP.\nThe agreements we entered into with ADP in connection with the separation, including the separation and distribution agreement and other agreements, were negotiated in the context of the separation while we were still a wholly owned subsidiary of ADP. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were negotiated, we did not have an independent board of directors or a management team independent of ADP. As a result, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements negotiated in the context of the separation relate to, among other things, the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights, and other obligations between ADP and us. Arm\u2019s-length negotiations between ADP and an unaffiliated third party in another form of transaction, such as a buyer in a sale of a business transaction, may have resulted in more favorable terms to us.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nour business profile and market capitalization may not fit the investment objectives of our stockholders, and our common stock may not be included in some indices, causing certain holders to sell their shares;\n\u2022\na shift in our investor base;\n\u2022\nthe actions of significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements and strategic moves, such as acquisitions or restructurings, by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations concerning our future financial performance and the future performance of our industry in general, including financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ndifferences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory framework of our industry and regulatory action;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThere is substantial volatility in the domestic and international stock markets that could negatively impact our stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. These forces reached unprecedented levels in the second half of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009, resulting in the bankruptcy or acquisition of, or government assistance to, several major domestic and international financial institutions and a material decline in economic conditions. In particular, the U.S. equity markets experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that\nhave affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. These broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nHolders of our common stock may be adversely affected through the issuance of more senior securities or through dilution.\nIn addition to the debt financing arrangements we entered into as part of the spin-off from ADP, we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity in order to fund working capital, capital expenditures and product development requirements, maintain debt capacity levels, repurchase shares of our common stock, or to make acquisitions and other investments. If we raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity, any debt securities or preferred stock issued will have liquidation rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds through the issuance of common equity, the issuance will dilute your ownership interest. We cannot assure you that debt or equity financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing, we may be unable to maintain or grow our business. It may also be more expensive for us to raise funds through the issuance of additional debt than the cost of raising funds or issuing debt for our business while we were part of ADP.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and of Delaware law and our tax matters agreement may prevent or delay an acquisition of our Company.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making them more burdensome to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to act by written consent; and\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nWe have not opted out of the protections afforded by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which provides that a stockholder acquiring more than 15% of our outstanding voting shares (an \u201cInterested Stockholder\u201d) but less than 85% of such shares may not engage in certain business combinations with us for a period of three years subsequent to the date on which the stockholder became an Interested Stockholder unless, prior to such date, our Board of Directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an Interested Stockholder or the business combination is approved by our Board of Directors and by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the Interested Stockholder.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal, and are not intended to make our Company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that we entered into with ADP, we are generally prohibited, except in specified circumstances, for specified periods of up to 24 months following the spin-off from consenting to certain acquisitions of significant amounts of our stock.\nAs discussed above, an acquisition or further issuance of our equity securities could trigger a tax to ADP, requiring us under the tax matters agreement to indemnify ADP for such tax. This indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock at the times or in the amounts we currently anticipate.\nSince our spin-off from ADP, our Board of Directors has declared, and we have paid, regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock of $0.12 per share. The payment of such quarterly dividends and any other future dividends will be at the\ndiscretion of our Board of Directors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends, as to what the amount of any future dividends will be, or that we will have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any future dividends. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, or increases in reserves. If we do not pay future dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for you to receive a gain on your investment in us. This appreciation may not occur and our stock may in fact depreciate in value.\nOn January 20, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of our common stock under a program expiring on January 19, 2018. The authorization was intended to offset dilution from our employee equity compensation plans and return capital to our stockholders. We have also indicated that we intend to return a significant portion of the free cash flow we expect to generate from our business transformation plan to our stockholders through, among other mechanisms, dividends and share repurchases. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 we repurchased a total of approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock, or 0.7% of our outstanding shares of our common stock as of October 1, 2014. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repurchase shares of our common stock at the times or in the amounts we currently anticipate due to due to market conditions, our cash and debt position, applicable laws and other factors, or that the results of the share repurchase program will be as beneficial as we currently anticipate.\nThe interests of significant stockholders may conflict with our interests or those of other stockholders, and their actions could disrupt our business and affect the market price and volatility of our securities.\nAs of June 30, 2015, three of our stockholders have made filings on Schedule 13D with the SEC indicating that they may take positions or make proposals with respect to, or with respect to potential changes in, among other things, our operations, management, management and employee incentives, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the composition of our Board of Directors, ownership, capital allocation policies, capital or corporate structure, dividend policy, potential acquisitions involving us or certain of our businesses or assets, strategy, and plans. The foregoing positions or proposals may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of our other stockholders. Significant stockholders may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment, even though such transactions involve risks to our other stockholders.\nResponding to actions by these, or other, significant stockholders can be costly, time-consuming, and disrupting to our operations and can divert the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business strategy, including our business transformation plan. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our Board of Directors. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our securities.", "PERMNO": 14926, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CDK"}
