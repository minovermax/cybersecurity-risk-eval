You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K and the reports we file with the SEC from time to time. Any of these risks could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Relating to our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness and significant debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to grow and operate our business.\nWe are a highly leveraged company and, as a result, have significant debt service obligations. In May 2013, we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.25% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the \u201c2020 Senior Notes\u201d), issued $17.5 million in unsecured 2020 subordinated promissory notes (the \u201c2020 Subordinated Notes\u201d and together with the 2020 Senior Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d), refinanced our prior 2015 Subordinated Notes and 2016 Subordinated Notes, and refinanced our prior senior secured asset-based credit facilities, composed of Term Debt and Revolving Line of Credit. Our total borrowings under the Notes and our senior secured asset-based credit facility entered into on May 2, 2013 and amended on June 14, 2013 and March 11, 2014 (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), excluding letters of credit, at December 31, 2014 was approximately $460.8 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had maximum availability for borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of approximately $46.0 million. Our Notes and Revolving Credit Facility mature on May 1, 2020 and May 2, 2018, respectively, and these borrowings are secured by liens on substantially all of our and the guarantors\u2019 existing and future assets. Our substantial indebtedness could require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to debt payments, thereby increasing our vulnerability to generally adverse economic and industry conditions, or limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and future business opportunities. If we are unable to repay our outstanding indebtedness, or refinance it on favorable terms, if at all, we may need to seek financing through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities. We may be unable to repay our borrowings under our Notes and Revolving Credit Facility when due, refinance this indebtedness on favorable terms, if at all, or obtain other financing on favorable terms, if at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to grow and operate our business.\nOur substantial indebtedness could also:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including our obligations under the indenture to purchase notes tendered as a result of a change in control;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to generally adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service payments on our debt;\n\u2022\nincrease the price volatility of our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to any of our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility requires that we maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.2:1.0 if our average excess availability is greater than $16.8 million (as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility) or 1.05:1.0 if our average excess availability is less than or equal to $16.8 million (as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility), and imposes an annual growth capital expenditures limit of $25.0 million, subject to standard carry-over provisions.\nFailure to comply with these covenants is an event of default under the facility and as a result our ability to draw down borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility depends in part on our compliance with these covenants.\nAn inability to draw down on our Revolving Credit Facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make capital expenditures, on our results of operations and on our liquidity. Further, failure to maintain the financial ratios required under our Revolving Credit Facility would constitute an event of default, allowing the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility to declare the entire balance of any and all sums payable under the Revolving Credit Facility immediately due and payable. If a payment default or acceleration were to occur under our Revolving Credit Facility, holders of 2020 Senior Notes would be permitted to accelerate the maturity of the 2020 Senior Notes.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and seek any potential re-financing of our indebtedness, including the debt existing at the time of the issuance of Notes as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales, which are subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, seasonality and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including (i) reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or (ii) dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in our industry could be impaired.\nWe may be unable to access public or private debt markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms, or in sufficient amounts, if at all.\nWe depend, in part, upon borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations and contractual commitments. If we were called upon to fund all outstanding commitments, we may not have sufficient funds to do so. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include general economic conditions, disruptions or declines in the global capital markets, and our financial performance, outlook, or credit ratings. An adverse change in any or all of these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments.\nIf our business does not perform as expected, including if we generate less revenue than anticipated from our operations or encounter significant unexpected costs, we may fail to comply with the financial covenants under our Revolving Credit Facility. If we do not comply with our financial covenants and we do not obtain a waiver or amendment, our lenders may accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding which would immediately become due and payable, together with accrued interest. Any default may require us to seek additional capital or modifications to our credit facilities, which may not be available or which may be costly. Additionally, our suppliers may require us to pay cash in advance or obtain letters of credit as a condition to selling us their products and services. Any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOperational Risks Relating to our Business\nThe helicopter services business is highly competitive.\nEach of our segments faces significant competition. We compete for most of our work with other helicopter operators and, for some operations, with fixed-wing operators and ground-based alternatives. Many of our contracts are awarded after competitive bidding, and competition for those contracts is generally intense. The principal aspects of competition are safety, price, reliability, availability, and service.\nWe have several major competitors and numerous small competitors operating in our aerial services markets. In the firefighting market, we compete heavily with both helicopter and fixed-wing operators. Our competitors may at times undercut our prices, especially if they are at risk of having too many idle aircraft. In the timber harvesting market, we compete with other heavy-lift helicopter operators, medium-lift helicopter operators, and ground-based solutions.\nIn the manufacturing and MRO market, our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors and the competitive pressures we face may result in reduced revenues and market share. If we are unable to adjust our costs relative to our pricing, our profitability will suffer. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, and may therefore be able to react to market conditions and compete more effectively than we do.\nWe depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of major customers.\nSeveral of our largest customers are governmental agencies or entities that may be subject to budget or other financial constraints. The economies of Greece and Italy in particular have been adversely affected by global financial pressures. In light of the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis, there are heightened risks associated with our future revenue attributable to, and our accounts receivable from, the Hellenic Fire Brigade, now contracted through NAMSA, and the Italian Ministry of Civil Protection. Similarly, in light of anticipated troop withdrawals in Afghanistan, there is a heightened risk of a decline in our future revenue attributable to our contract with Fluor. Should we lose one of our major customers for any reason, we may be unable to identify new opportunities sufficient to avoid a reduction in revenues and our business and financial condition could suffer.\nIn addition, contracts with the majority of our significant customers are multi-year contracts; however, many of these contracts are subject to a cancellation notice period of 90 days or less, and all of these contracts are periodically up for renewal or rebid. Renewal, or a successful rebid, is not guaranteed. Should we lose one of our major customers for any reason, we may be unable to identify new opportunities sufficient to avoid a reduction in our revenues and operating earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If one or more of these customers is disproportionately impacted by factors that affect its ability to pay us or to enter into new contracts with us, including general economic factors, our operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSeveral of our material contracts provide for differentiating factors in their award process which include small business status, performance records, safety records, and other factors. Several of these factors have been instrumental in us winning new work and continuing contracts. Should our ability to utilize these differentiating factors become compromised, our operating results may be materially impacted.\nOur helicopter operations involve significant risks, which may result in hazards that may not be covered by our insurance or may increase the cost of our insurance.\nThe operation of helicopters inherently involves a high degree of risk. Hazards such as aircraft accidents, mechanical failures, collisions, fire, and adverse weather may result in loss of life, serious injury to employees and other persons, damage to property, losses of equipment and revenues, revocation of necessary governmental approvals and suspension or reduction of operations. The aerial services we provide and the missions we fly, which include firefighting and timber harvesting in confined spaces, can be hazardous. In addition, we ship our helicopters to various locations, which expose them to various risks when in transit, including risks relating to piracy, inclement weather and improper shipment. We maintain hull and liability insurance on our aircraft, which insures us against physical loss of, or damage to, our aircraft and against certain legal liabilities to others. In addition, we carry war risk, expropriation, confiscation, and nationalization insurance for our aircraft involved in international operations. In some instances, we are covered by indemnity agreements from our customers in lieu of, or in addition to, our insurance. In addition, we maintain product liability insurance for aircraft and aircraft components we manufacture. Our insurance will not cover any losses incurred pursuant to any performance provisions under agreements with our customers.\nOur insurance and indemnification arrangements may not cover all potential losses and are subject to deductibles, retentions, coverage limits, and coverage exceptions and, as a result, severe casualty losses or the expropriation or confiscation of significant assets could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. The insured value of one of our aircraft is typically lower than its replacement cost, and our aircraft are not insured for loss of use. The occurrence of an event that impairs the use of an aircraft but that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The loss of an aircraft, which we believe would take us at least six months to replace, could negatively impact our operations.\nFailure to maintain our safety record would seriously harm our ability to attract new customers and maintain our existing customers, and would increase our insurance costs.\nA favorable safety record is one of the primary factors a customer reviews in selecting an aviation provider. If we fail to maintain our safety and reliability record, our ability to attract new customers and maintain our current customers will be materially and adversely affected. In addition, safety violations could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny; increase our insurance rates and expense, which is a significant operating cost; or increase the difficulty of maintaining our existing insurance coverage in the future, which would adversely affect our operations. Because of the inherent risks in our helicopter operations, no safety program can guarantee accidents will not occur.\nOur failure to timely collect our receivables could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe provide services to our customers for which we are customarily not paid in advance. We rely on the creditworthiness of our customers to collect on our receivables in a timely manner after we have billed for services previously provided. While we generally provide services pursuant to a written contract which determines the terms and conditions of payment to us by our customers, occasionally customers may dispute a bill and delay, contest, or not pay our receivable. Our failure to timely collect our receivables could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations and could cause us to fail to comply with the financial covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility.\nFactors beyond our control, including weather and seasonal fluctuations, may reduce aircraft flight hours, which would affect our revenues and operations.\nA significant portion of our operating revenue is dependent on actual flight hours, and a substantial portion of our direct costs are fixed. Flight hours could be negatively impacted by factors beyond our control and fluctuate depending on cyclical weather-related and seasonal limitations, which would affect our revenues and operations. In addition, our aircraft are not currently equipped to fly at night, reinforcing the seasonality of our business with more activity in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months and less activity during the winter months. Poor visibility, high winds, and heavy precipitation can restrict the operation of helicopters and significantly reduce our flight hours. Reduced flight hours can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We budget for our operations based on historical weather information, but unexpectedly poor weather could materially affect our results of operations.\nSome of our backlog may be deferred or may not be realized.\nBacklog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to derive from signed contracts, including oral contracts that have been subsequently memorialized in writing, or anticipated exercises of customer extension options. For contracts that include a guaranteed number of hours, the value of the guaranteed hours is included in backlog. For CPH contracts, which depend on hours flown by our customers, we calculate the contribution to backlog based on contracted minimum hours. We calculate the contribution to backlog for some timber harvesting contracts based on our estimate of the cubic meters of high grade timber we expect to deliver under the contract based on our experience. As a result, our estimates of backlog for some of our timber harvesting contracts could be affected by variables beyond our control and may not be entirely realized, if at all. In addition, given the nature of our customers and our industry, there is a risk that our backlog may not be fully realized in the future. Failure to realize sales from our existing or future backlog would negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSome of our arrangements with customers are short-term, ad hoc, or \u201ccall when needed\u201d and may not be renewed.\nWe generate a portion of our revenues from arrangements with customers with terms of less than six months, ad hoc arrangements, and \u201ccall when needed\u201d contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2014, for example, approximately 5% of our revenues were derived from such arrangements. There is a risk that customers may not continue to seek the same level of services from us as they have in the past or that they will not renew these arrangements or terminate them at short notice. Under \u201ccall when needed\u201d contracts, we pre-negotiate rates for providing services that customers may request that we perform (but which we are not typically obligated to perform) depending on their needs. The rates we charge for these contingent services are higher than the rates under stand-by arrangements, and we attempt to schedule our aircraft to maximize our revenue from these types of contracts. The ultimate value we derive from such contracts is subject to factors beyond our control, such as the severity and duration of fire seasons. In the past, several of our larger contracts have not been renewed for reasons unrelated to our performance, such as the financial condition of our customers or their decision to internalize the services we provided to them. If we are unable to retain or replace customers experiencing similar circumstances, our business and financial condition could suffer.\nIf an accident or sale made an aircraft unavailable to us, our business could suffer.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we operated a fleet of 86 aircraft, 62 of which were providing government and commercial aerial services during the year. An accident or sale could make an aircraft unavailable to us temporarily or permanently. A sale of an aircraft that is part of our fleet would also reduce the number of aircraft available to provide Aerial Services. The purchase price of a used aircraft is generally lower than the purchase price of a remanufactured aircraft. Although we would expect to be able to maintain the level of our operations if we sell an aircraft from our fleet through more efficient scheduling of our fleet or by allocating aircraft remanufactured in our plant to aerial services operations, we may not always have the ability to maintain our desired level of Aerial Services operations with a reduced fleet and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nForeign, domestic, federal, state and local government spending and mission priorities may change in a manner that materially and adversely affects our future revenues and limits our growth prospects.\nOur business depends upon continued government expenditures on programs that we support. These expenditures have not remained constant over time. Current foreign and domestic government spending levels on programs that we support may not be sustainable as a result of changes in government leadership, policies, or priorities.\nAdditionally, our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be materially harmed by the following:\n\u2022\nbudgetary constraints affecting government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies in particular, and changes in fiscal policies or available funding;\n\u2022\nchanges in government programs or requirements;\n\u2022\nreductions in military and defense spending;\n\u2022\nrealignment of funds to address changed government priorities;\n\u2022\ngovernment shutdowns (such as those which occurred during the U.S. Government\u2019s 1996 and 2013 fiscal years) and other potential delays in government appropriations processes;\n\u2022\ndelays in the payment of our invoices by government authorities;\n\u2022\nadoption of new laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nThese or other factors could cause government agencies and departments to reduce their purchases under contracts, exercise their right to terminate contracts, or not exercise options to renew contracts, any of which could cause us to lose revenue. A significant decline in overall government spending or a shift in expenditures away from agencies or programs that we support could cause a material decline in our revenues and harm our financial results.\nProduct liability and product warranty risks could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe produce, repair, and overhaul complex aircraft and critical parts for aircraft. Failure of our aircraft or parts could give rise to substantial product liability and other damage claims. We maintain insurance to address this risk, but our insurance coverage may not be adequate for some claims and there is no guarantee that insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nAdditionally, aircraft and parts we manufacture for sale are subject to strict contractually established specifications using complex manufacturing processes. If we fail to meet the contractual requirements for a part, we may be subject to warranty costs to repair or replace the part itself and additional costs related to the investigation and inspection of non-complying parts. These costs are generally not insured. We establish warranty reserves that represent our estimate of the costs we expect to incur to fulfill our warranty requirements. We base our estimate for warranty reserves on our historical experience and other assumptions. If actual results materially differ from these estimates, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause we own the S-64 Type Certificate, we are obligated to issue directives to operators of our aircraft and to identify defects in or required replacements for our aircraft. We could be liable to operators of our aircraft if we fail to fulfill our obligation to issue directives, even if our aircraft or components of our aircraft are no longer under warranty. We also purchased the Type Certificate during 2013 for engines used in the S-64 Aircranes.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect us.\nOur pilots and maintenance and manufacturing personnel are highly trained and qualified. Our ability to attract and retain qualified pilots, mechanics, and other highly trained personnel will be an important factor in determining our future success. Our aircraft, and the aerial services we provide, require pilots with high levels of flight experience. The market for these\nexperienced and highly trained personnel is extremely competitive. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain such persons. Some of our pilots and mechanics, and those of our competitors, are members of the U.S. military reserves and could be called to active duty. If significant numbers of such persons were called to active duty, it would reduce the supply of such workers, possibly curtailing our operations and likely increasing our labor costs. Because of our small size relative to many of our competitors, we may be unable to attract qualified personnel as easily as our competitors.\nThe occurrence of events for which the risk is allocated to us under our contracts could negatively impact our results of operations.\nMany of our contracts are fixed price agreements which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. Under these contracts, we typically are responsible for normal maintenance, repair, and fuel costs. In addition, some of our Aerial Services contracts have performance penalty provisions, subjecting us to the risk of unexpected down time caused by mechanical failures, extreme weather or otherwise, which could cause our net income to suffer. Risks associated with estimating our costs and revenues are exacerbated for long-term contracts, which include most of our material contracts.\nOur contracts for remanufacture of aircraft and major overhauls or components typically contain penalty provisions that require us to make payments to customers, or provide interim aerial services to them at no cost, if we are unable to timely deliver aircraft or components. Such contracts may also include a repurchase obligation by us if certain performance or other criteria are not met.\nOur customers may seek to shift risk to us.\nWe give to and receive from our customers indemnities relating to damages caused or sustained by us in connection with our operations. Our customers\u2019 changing views on risk allocation could cause us to accept greater risk to win new business or could result in us losing business if we are not prepared to take such risks. To the extent that we accept such additional risk, and seek to insure against it, our insurance premiums could rise.\nWe may be required to provide components or services to owners or operators of the S-64 or the CH-54, which could limit our operational flexibility and divert resources from more productive uses.\nBecause we own the S-64 Type Certificate, we may be required to supply components or provide MRO services to customers who own or operate the S-64 or the CH-54, the military version of the S-64. This could limit our operational flexibility, divert resources from more productive uses, and adversely affect our ability to execute on our growth plans.\nOur dependence on a small number of manufacturers for some of our aircraft components and the costs associated with the purchase or manufacture of new components pose significant risks to our business.\nWe rely on over 200 supplier business units or locations for significant or critical components. A small number of manufacturers make some of the key components for our aircraft, and in some instances there is only a single manufacturer, although other manufacturers could be used if necessary for all of our components. If these manufacturers experience production delays, or if the cost of components increases, our operations could suffer. If a manufacturer ceases production of a required component, we could incur significant costs in purchasing the right to manufacture those components or in developing and certifying a suitable replacement, and in manufacturing those components.\nMany key components and parts of our aircraft have not been manufactured since originally introduced. A significant portion of our inventory was acquired in bulk on the surplus market. For some aviation components, our operating cost includes the overhaul and repair of these components but does not include the purchase of a new component. It may be difficult to locate a supplier willing and able to manufacture replacement components at a reasonable cost or at all. As we exhaust our inventory, the purchase of any new components, or the manufacture by us of new components, could materially increase our operating cost or delay our operations; we routinely monitor levels of out-of-production parts and design and certify replacement parts to mitigate this risk.\nFailure to develop new technologies, and to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our operations.\nOur success has resulted in part from our development of new applications for our aircraft, such as our fire tank and snorkel for firefighting services, and we believe our growth will continue to depend on the development of new products or applications. Competitors may develop similar applications for their aircraft, which would increase our competition in providing aerial services. In addition, our growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products and applications. A number\nof factors, including FAA certifications, could result in our being unable to capitalize on the development costs for such products or applications. Not all of our products and applications have been, or may be, patented or otherwise legally protected. We rely upon intellectual property law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, clients, consultants, partners, and others to protect our new and existing intellectual property rights. Any of these parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for any specific breach. If we are not able to adequately protect the inventions and intellectual property we have developed, in the U.S. and in foreign countries, or if any of our trade secrets, know-how, or other technologies were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may have to engage in litigation to defend our trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful, such litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we are not successful in such litigation, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights.\nAny of our patents may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or rendered unenforceable. Our patents may be subject to reexamination proceedings affecting their scope. We cannot assure that we will be successful should one or more of our patents be challenged for any reason. If our patent claims are rendered invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope, the patent coverage afforded our products could be impaired, which could significantly impede our ability to market our products, negatively affect our competitive position, and harm our business and operating results.\nFurther, we are a party to licenses that grant us rights to intellectual property, including trade secrets, that is necessary or useful to our business. One or more of our licensors may allege that we have breached our license agreement with them, and accordingly seek to terminate our license. If successful, this could result in our loss of the right to use the licensed intellectual property, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our technologies, products, or services, as well as harm our competitive business position and our business prospects.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with international operations, including operations in emerging markets.\nWe purchase products from and supply products to businesses located outside of the United States. We also have significant operations outside the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, approximately 70% and 66%, respectively, of our total revenues were attributable to operations in non-U.S. countries. A number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nthe uncertain ability of select non-U.S. customers to finance purchases and our inability in certain jurisdictions to evaluate accurately the creditworthiness of potential customers due to fewer transparency and disclosure requirements;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, which can reduce our revenues for transactions denominated in non-U.S. currency or make our services relatively more expensive if denominated in U.S. currency;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022\npolitical and financial instability in several of the countries in which we operate, including Greece and Italy;\n\u2022\nthe exit or closure of any foreign operations or venues as a result of uncertain local business or legal conditions;\n\u2022\nsignificant receivables from international customers;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with transporting our aircraft, including risks associated with piracy and adverse weather;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the costs associated with transporting our aircraft, pilots, and crews, which are significant operating costs for us;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022\nuncertainties regarding required approvals or legal structures necessary to operate aircraft or provide our products and services in a given jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory structures or trade policies;\n\u2022\ntariff and tax regulations including permanent establishment determinations by foreign governments;\n\u2022\nensuring compliance with the FCPA;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining export and import licenses; and\n\u2022\nthe risk of government-financed competition.\nPart of our growth strategy is to enter new markets, including emerging market countries such as China and in South America. Emerging market countries have less developed economies that are more vulnerable to economic and political problems and may experience significant fluctuations in gross domestic product, interest rates, and currency exchange rates, as well as civil disturbances, government instability, nationalization and expropriation of private assets, and the imposition of taxes or other charges by government authorities. The occurrence of any of these events and the resulting economic instability that may arise could adversely affect our operations in those countries, or the ability of our customers in those countries to meet their\nobligations. As a result, customers that operate in emerging market countries may be more likely to default than customers that operate in developed countries. In addition, legal systems in emerging market countries may be less developed, which could make it more difficult for us to enforce our legal rights in those countries. In particular, we have focused on expanding our presence in developing markets such as China and Malaysia, and the laws and regulations governing aviation sales and services may require approvals that are uncertain and enforcement of joint venture or other contractual relationships may be uncertain. For these and other reasons, our growth plans may be materially and adversely affected by adverse economic and political developments in emerging market countries.\nWe are subject to many different forms of taxation in various jurisdictions throughout the world, which could lead to disagreements with tax authorities regarding the application of tax laws.\nWe are subject to many different forms of taxation including, but not limited to, income tax, withholding tax, commodity tax and payroll-related taxes. Tax law and administration is extremely complex and often requires us to make subjective determinations. The tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business might not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law. Such disagreements could result in lengthy legal disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of substantial funds to the government authorities of foreign and local jurisdictions where we conduct business or provide goods or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur estimate of tax related assets, liabilities, recoveries and expenses incorporates significant assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the tax laws in various jurisdictions, the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions, taxable income projections, and the benefits of various restructuring plans. To the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results, we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risks.\nOur consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in currencies consisting primarily of Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, the Euro, Peruvian Nuevo Sol, and the Brazilian Real. The functional currencies of several of our subsidiaries are non-U.S. currencies. There can be no assurances that our foreign currency risk management strategies will be effective and that foreign currency fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d.\nIf our employees unionize, our expenses could increase and our results of operations would suffer.\nExcept for statutory protections for a small number of Italian pilots and our Brazilian employees, none of our employees work under collective bargaining, union or similar agreements. Unionization efforts have been made from time to time within our industry, with varying degrees of success. If our employees unionize, our expenses could increase and our results of operations may suffer.\nFuel shortages or fluctuations in the price of fuel could adversely affect our operations.\nOur aerial operations depend on the use of jet fuel. Fuel costs have historically been subject to wide price fluctuations, and fuel availability is subject to shortage and is affected by demand for heating oil, gasoline, and other petroleum products. Fuel shortages and increases in the price of fuel, or decreases in the price of fuel when we have entered into hedging agreements, could adversely affect our operations.\nOur production may be interrupted due to equipment failures or other events affecting our factories.\nOur manufacturing and testing processes depend on sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment could result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, our factories rely on the availability of electrical power and natural gas, transportation for raw materials and finished product, and employee access to our workplace that are subject to interruption in the event of severe weather conditions or other natural or man made events. While we maintain backup resources to the extent practicable, a severe or prolonged equipment outage or other interruptive event affecting areas where we have significant manufacturing operations may result in loss of manufacturing days or in shipping delays which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe rely on information technology, and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted and our business could be negatively affected.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information; to coordinate our business across our global operation bases; and to communicate within our company and with customers, suppliers, partners and other third-parties. These information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns, hardware or software failures, power outages, computer viruses, cyber attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our operations could be disrupted and our business could be negatively affected. In addition, cyber attacks could lead to potential unauthorized access and disclosure of confidential information, and data loss and corruption. There is no assurance that we will not experience these service interruptions or cyber attacks in the future.\nGeneral economic conditions and recent market events may expose us to new risks.\nRecent events in the financial markets and the economic downturn have contributed to severe volatility in the securities markets, a severe liquidity crisis in the global financial markets, and unprecedented government intervention. These conditions have affected our results of operations and may continue to affect them. In such an environment, significant additional risks may exist for us. The recent instability in the financial markets has led the U.S. government to take a number of unprecedented actions designed to support certain financial and other institutions and segments of the financial market that have experienced extreme volatility, and in some cases, a lack of liquidity. There can be no assurance that this intervention will improve market conditions, that such conditions will not continue to deteriorate, or that further government intervention will or will not occur. If economic conditions worsen, we face risks that may include:\n\u2022\ndeclines in revenues and profitability from reduced or delayed orders by our customers, in particular with respect to infrastructure construction projects which may be delayed or canceled;\n\u2022\nsupply problems associated with any financial constraints faced by our suppliers;\n\u2022\nreductions in credit availability to us or in general;\n\u2022\nincreases in corporate tax rates to finance government spending programs; and\n\u2022\nreductions in spending by governmental entities for services such as infrastructure construction and firefighting.\nThe economic downturn and continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may have an adverse impact on our business and our financial condition. We cannot predict our ability to obtain financing, and this could limit our ability to fund our future growth and operations. In addition, the creditworthiness of some of our customers may be affected, which may affect our ability to collect on our accounts receivable from such customers.\nExisting stockholders exert significant influence over us. Their interests may not coincide with other stockholders and they may make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree.\nEntities affiliated with ZM Equity Partners, LLC own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock, and two of our directors are managing directors of Centre Lane Partners, LLC, an affiliate of ZM Equity Partners, LLC. As a result, these stockholders, acting individually or together, could exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, these stockholders could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that other stockholders would not approve or make other decisions with which other stockholders disagree.\nRegulatory Risks Relating to Our Business\nWe are subject to FAA regulation and similar international regulation, and our failure to comply with these regulations, or the adoption of any new laws, policies, or regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe aerial services business is heavily regulated by governmental entities in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. We operate in the United States under laws and regulations administered by the DOT, principally through the FAA. The FAA promulgates rules relating to the general operation of our aircraft, the process by which our aircraft are maintained, the components and systems that are installed in our aircraft, the qualification of our flight crews and maintenance personnel, and the specialized operations that we undertake, including the carrying of loads and the use of various chemicals. We are regularly inspected by FAA personnel to ensure compliance. Additionally, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries\nand investigations of our business due to, among other things, our business relationships with the U.S. government and the heavily regulated nature of our industry. Compliance with these rules is complex and costly, and the failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines, the grounding of our aircraft as a result of the promulgation by the FAA of airworthiness directives or for other safety-related reasons, or other consequences detrimental to our operations and operating results. Our operations in other countries are similarly regulated under equivalent local laws and regulations.\nOur aircraft manufacturing and MRO operations are also subject to regulation by the FAA and other governmental authorities. The FAA promulgates regulations applicable to the design and manufacture of aircraft and aircraft systems and components. It also sets and enforces standards for the repair of aircraft, systems, and components and for the qualification of personnel performing such functions. It regularly conducts inspections to ensure compliance and has the power to impose fines or other penalties for non-compliance or to shut down non-compliant operations. Our manufacturing and MRO operations are also subject to complex environmental, safety, and other regulations. Failure to comply with these applicable regulations could result in the imposition of fines or other penalties or in the shutting down of our operations, which could impair our ability to fulfill our contracts or otherwise negatively impact our reputation for safety and dependability.\nThe FAA must approve major changes in aircraft design such as fuel control systems or new rotor blades. Such approvals take time, require significant investment, and are not assured. Similar regulatory bodies in other countries may accept FAA certification or may impose their own individual requirements. The failure to obtain FAA or other required approval for such changes, or the imposition of unanticipated restrictions as a condition of approval, could increase our production costs or reduce the effectiveness of the system in question and could render our development effort less valuable or, in an extreme case, worthless.\nThe laws and regulations affecting our business are subject to change at any time and, because we operate under numerous jurisdictions, we are particularly exposed to the possibility of such changes.\nAny change in laws or regulations applicable to our business could restrict our operations, increase our costs, or have other effects detrimental to our results of operations or competitive position.\nOur business is affected by federal rules, regulations, and orders applicable to government contractors, and the award of government contracts may be challenged.\nSome of our services are sold under U.S. or foreign government contracts or subcontracts. In addition, governmental contracts typically require a competitive bid process, and the award of a contract may be subject to challenge by bid participants. In addition, government contracts are terminable at any time for the convenience of the government. From time to time, we are also subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business practices due to our participation in government programs. These inquiries and investigations are costly and consume internal resources. Violation of applicable government rules and regulations could result in civil liability, the cancellation or suspension of existing contracts, or the ineligibility for future contracts or subcontracts funded in whole or in part with federal funds, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. United States laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\"ITAR\"), the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). EAR restricts the export of dual-use products and technical data to certain countries, while ITAR restricts the export of defense products, technical data and defense services. The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering EAR and ITAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. We also cannot provide services to certain countries subject to United States trade sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from OFAC. In addition, we are subject to the FCPA, and other anti-bribery laws that, generally, bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials.\nViolations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges, loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business and criminal penalties and may harm our ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. government. A future violation of ITAR or the other regulations enumerated above could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments increases the compliance risks associated with our international activities.\nOur international operations could expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. The U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties at their disposal to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of trading sanctions laws, the FCPA, and other federal statutes. Under trading sanctions laws, the government may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and could subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. If any of the risks described above were to materialize, they could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nThese laws also prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, deal with government entities and have contracts in countries known to experience corruption. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents or associates that could be in violation of various laws including the FCPA, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. Our existing safeguards and procedures might prove to be less than fully effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or associates might engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we could be subject to other liabilities that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nClaims against us by governmental agencies or other parties related to environmental matters could adversely affect us.\nIn the late 1990s, environmental damage that resulted from hazardous substances at our Central Point, Oregon facility was identified. It was determined that the contamination migrated beyond the property boundary at our facility and impacted off-site water supply wells. A remediation was completed in the late 1990s. Based on the testing of the site in recent years, the contamination levels have been decreasing, though the remediation cannot be guaranteed. We are continuing to participate in monitoring and testing the remediation of the site and we incur ongoing costs for this monitoring and testing. Our obligations in respect of such contamination are subject to an indemnification agreement with our former owner. Under this agreement, our potential total liability in respect of remediation costs is capped at $0.5 million, of which we have already paid $0.4 million, with a total remaining liability of $0.1 million. Although the agreement caps our total potential liability, the creditworthiness of the indemnitor is uncertain. If the indemnitor fails to honor the terms of the indemnification agreement, it is possible that we would have to bear the entire cost of the remediation, monitoring and testing. In addition, it is possible that government agencies or other parties could bring a claim against us resulting from the contamination and that defending and resolving such claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental and other regulation and liability may increase our costs and adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including environmental and health and safety regulations. Because our operations are inherently hazardous, compliance with these regulations is challenging and requires constant attention and focus. We are subject to federal, state, and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, water discharges, air emissions, hazardous material and waste management, and environmental cleanup. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues, such as reporting greenhouse gas emissions. We are required to comply with environmental laws and with the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits. Our failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to fines and other penalties administered by the agencies responsible for environmental and safety compliance or by the FAA or other aviation-related agencies.\nOur business is subject to laws limiting ownership or control of aircraft companies, which may increase our costs and adversely affect us.\nMost of the countries in which we operate have laws requiring local ownership or control, or both, of certain kinds of companies that operate aircraft. We use various strategies to comply with these laws, including the formation of local subsidiaries that we do not wholly own and partnerships with local companies. FAA regulations may require that at least 75% of our voting securities be owned or controlled by United States citizens. The existence of these laws may restrict our operations; reduce our profit from, or control of, some foreign operations; or restrict the market for our securities.\nRisks Relating to Acquisitions\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of the EHI and Air Amazonia acquisitions or other acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances, or divestitures.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire businesses or specific assets, form joint ventures or strategic alliances, and divest operations. For example, we acquired EHI in May 2013 and Air Amazonia in September 2013. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends, in part, upon the integration between the businesses or assets involved; the performance of the underlying products, capabilities, or technologies; whether we incur unknown or contingent liabilities; and the management of the operations. We have had limited experience with such integrations, and difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies could disrupt our business operations, divert management\u2019s time and attention and impair relationships with and risk the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance, and indemnifications. In addition, our cash from operations, the 2020 Senior Notes offering and borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility may not be sufficient to fund any acquisitions or strategic transactions we choose to make. As a result, in the event we engage in any acquisitions or strategic transactions we may need to seek additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or other sources of financing. Consolidations or joint ventures could also impact our results of operations or financial position. Divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe do not have extensive operating history in passenger and cargo transportation or with the types of aircraft we acquired in the EHI and Air Amazonia acquisitions.\nWe have historically operated the S-64 Aircrane, specializing in heavy-lift aerial services such as firefighting, timber harvesting, infrastructure construction and oil and gas exploration. We have limited experience in transporting passengers and cargo with medium and light-lift rotor wing aircraft and fixed wing aircraft. Failure to properly comply with Part 135 regulations and maintenance requirements could lead to the revocation of the certification, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe do not have an extensive operating history in South America, the Middle East and Africa, the geographic locations in which EHI and Air Amazonia historically operated.\nOur acquisition of EHI and Air Amazonia has resulted in our operating in new international geographic locations. A number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nthe uncertain ability of select non-U.S. customers to finance purchases;\n\u2022\nour inability in certain jurisdictions to evaluate accurately the creditworthiness of potential customers due to fewer transparency and disclosure requirements;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, which can reduce our revenues for transactions denominated in non-U.S. currency or make our services relatively more expensive if denominated in U.S. currency;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022\npolitical and financial instability;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with transporting our aircraft, including risks associated with piracy and adverse weather;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the costs associated with transporting our aircraft, pilots, and crews, which are significant operating costs for us;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022\nuncertainties regarding required approvals or legal structures necessary to operate aircraft or provide our products and services in a given jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the repatriation of funds from our foreign operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory structures or trade policies;\n\u2022\ntariff and tax regulations including permanent establishment determinations by foreign governments;\n\u2022\nensuring compliance with the FCPA; and\n\u2022\nthe risk of government-financed competition.\nEmerging market countries have less developed economies that are more vulnerable to economic and political problems and may experience significant fluctuations in gross domestic product, interest rates, and currency exchange rates, as well as civil disturbances, government instability, nationalization and expropriation of private assets, and the imposition of taxes or other\ncharges by government authorities. The occurrence of any of these events and the resulting economic instability that may arise could adversely affect our operations in those countries, or the ability of our customers in those countries to meet their obligations. As a result, customers that operate in emerging market countries may be more likely to default than customers that operate in developed countries. In addition, legal systems in emerging market countries may be less developed, which could make it more difficult for us to enforce our legal rights in those countries.\nWe do not have extensive operating history with DoD-related services of the type EHI historically provided.\nOur acquisition of EHI has resulted in our providing helicopter services to DoD-related customers and projects, which we had not previously done. The DoD requires CARB certification in order to provide passenger and cargo transportation services. Our failure to remain in compliance with applicable regulations and requirements could lead to the loss of DoD related business, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDoD contracts and programs are subject to U.S. government defense budgets, which could be impacted by forces beyond our control such as:\n\u2022\nbudgetary constraints affecting government spending generally or specific departments or agencies in particular, and changes in fiscal policies or available funding;\n\u2022\nchanges in government programs or requirements;\n\u2022\ngovernment shutdowns, the effects of sequestration that commenced on March 1, 2013, and other potential delays in government appropriations processes;\n\u2022\nadoption of new laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nthreat of national risk and war; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nThese or other factors could cause government agencies and departments to reduce their purchases under contracts, exercise their right to terminate contracts, or not exercise options to renew contracts, any of which could cause us to lose revenue. A significant decline in overall government spending or a shift in expenditures away from agencies or programs that EHI has historically supported could cause a material decline in our revenues and harm our financial results.\nThe anticipated reduction in troops in Afghanistan in the near-term may adversely affect us.\nThe largest customer we acquired in the EHI transaction provides base and troop support services in Afghanistan to various departments of the U.S. government. The U.S. government has announced plans to reduce its military activities in Afghanistan in 2014 and beyond, although we do not know the exact timing and number of troops to be withdrawn at this time. This reduction has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our overall Government revenue. As a result of the already reduced level of flight activity in the Afghanistan region, we have seen increased pressure from our competitors in connection with new DoD contracts in other regions of the world where we operate, which we believe may negatively impact our pricing with respect to some of the new DoD contracts on which we bid. In addition, our end-customer in the Philippines has indicated that certain portions or all of the contracted work in that region will be progressively concluding by the middle of 2015. While we do not yet fully understand the magnitude of this reduction in service levels, this uncertainty may have a negative impact on the Government segment of our business. As the number of the aircraft being utilized by our DoD customers changes, we will actively manage our leased aircraft portfolio. If we are not successful, the fixed lease costs may negatively impact our margins.\nEIA, the former parent company of EHI, filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on December 31, 2013.\nIn acquiring EHI, we acquired a business with significant accounts payable outstanding as a result of the financial distress at EIA. Certain vendors and suppliers are holding aircraft, parts and equipment as a result of missed or delayed payments, and as a result, EHI was not able to adequately maintain certain of its aircraft. A number of these aircraft are not air-worthy, causing dissatisfaction among certain customers. Failure by Erickson to promptly source the parts and equipment necessary to repair the aircraft could lead to the loss of or ineligibility for significant contracts, including government contracts, which will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFurthermore, failure to come to terms with EHI\u2019s vendors and suppliers may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. A settlement or judgment in which we are not the prevailing party could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nEHI\u2019s practice of leasing a significant portion of the aircraft in its fleet may result in higher operating costs and contractual obligations for us.\nIn acquiring EHI, we acquired a company that leased a majority of its aircraft, which may result in higher operating costs and contractual obligations than if it owned these aircraft. Certain of these aircraft lessors require the aircraft to be returned in airworthy condition at the termination of the lease, which could result in higher capital expenditures. Failure to comply with the terms of the leases could result in significant fees and expenses or the foreclosure of an aircraft, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nEHI operates in certain dangerous and war-affected areas, which may result in hazards to our fleet and personnel.\nThe operation of helicopters inherently involves a high degree of risk. Hazards such as aircraft accidents, mechanical failures, collisions, fire, adverse weather, explosions, military attacks and other military activities may result in loss of life, serious injury to employees and other persons, damage to property, losses of equipment and revenues, and suspension or reduction of operations. The aerial services we provide, which with our acquisition of EHI now include passenger and cargo transportation in dangerous and war-affected areas, can be hazardous. We maintain hull and liability insurance on our aircraft, including those acquired in the EHI acquisition, which insures against physical loss of, or damage to, the aircraft and against certain legal liabilities to others. In addition, we carry war risk, expropriation, confiscation, and nationalization insurance for the aircraft involved in international operations associated with EHI\u2019s historical operations. In some instances, we are covered by indemnity agreements from customers in lieu of, or in addition to, insurance. Our insurance will not cover any losses incurred pursuant to any performance provisions under agreements with our customers.\nOur insurance and indemnification arrangements may not cover all potential losses and are subject to deductibles, retentions, coverage limits, and coverage exceptions and, as a result, severe casualty losses or the expropriation or confiscation of significant assets could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. The insured value of one aircraft is typically lower than its replacement cost, and the aircraft are not insured for loss of use. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAir Amazonia operates solely in Brazil which is highly regulated regarding various matters. We may not be able to operate successfully in that country.\nFollowing our acquisition of Air Amazonia, our business in Brazil is subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent to operating in that country. The Brazilian government frequently intervenes in the Brazilian economy and occasionally makes significant changes in the monetary and credit policy and economic regulation, as well as in other governmental policies. The Brazilian government\u2019s actions to influence the economy, control inflation and other policies and regulations have often involved, among other measures, price and salary controls, currency devaluations, exchange controls and limits on imports and the freezing of bank accounts. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government policies or regulations related to public charges and control over the foreign exchange rate, whether they are implemented at the federal, state or municipal level, as well as by other factors, such as:\n\u2022\nexchange rates and exchange control policies;\n\u2022\ninflation rates;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nliquidity of domestic capital and credit markets;\n\u2022\ntax policies;\n\u2022\nprice, social and political instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in the tax regime, including charges applicable to specific industry sectors; and\n\u2022\nother political, diplomatic, social and economic developments in or affecting Brazil.", "PERMNO": 13373, "SIC": 7350, "TIC": "EACIQ"}
