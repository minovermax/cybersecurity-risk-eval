The risks described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks that are currently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation could be adversely affected.\nSignificant deterioration in economic conditions, especially in the United States and Europe, has had and may again have negative effects on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows\nSignificant deterioration in economic conditions, especially in the United States and Europe, has had and may again have negative effects on the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. Economic conditions affect the Company\u2019s sales volumes, pricing levels and overall profitability. Demand for many of the Company\u2019s products depends on end-use markets. Challenging economic conditions may reduce demand for our products and may also impair the ability of customers to pay for products they have purchased. As a result, the Company\u2019s reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs for accounts receivable may increase.\nA significant deterioration in economic conditions has caused and may again cause deterioration in the credit quality of our customers and the estimated residual value of our equipment. This could further negatively impact the ability of our customers to obtain the resources they need to make purchases of our equipment. Reduced credit availability will diminish our customers\u2019 ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, and meet ongoing working capital needs. If customers do not have sufficient access to credit, demand for the Company\u2019s products will likely decline. Reduced access to credit and the capital markets will also negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions.\nThe Company may require additional funding, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on the amount of cash generated or required by our current operations, as well as additional funds which may be needed to finance future acquisitions. Future cash needs are subject to substantial uncertainty.\nWe cannot guarantee that adequate funds will be available when needed, and if we do not receive sufficient capital, we may be required to alter or reduce the scope of our operations or to forego making future acquisitions. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, existing stockholders may be diluted.\nThe Company\u2019s business is sensitive to increases in interest rates.\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of variable rate debt. Primary exposure includes movements in the U.S. prime rate, the Canadian prime rate and Italian short-term borrowing rates.\nIf interest rates rise, it becomes more costly for the Company\u2019s customers to borrow money to pay for the equipment they buy from the Company. Should the U. S. Federal Reserve Board decide to increase rates, prospects for business investment and manufacturing could deteriorate sufficiently and impact sales opportunities.\nThe Company\u2019s business is sensitive to government spending.\nMany of the Company\u2019s customers depend substantially on government spending, including highway construction and maintenance and other infrastructure projects by U.S. federal and state governments and governments in other nations. Any decrease or delay in government funding of highway construction and maintenance and other infrastructure projects could cause the Company\u2019s revenues and profits to decrease.\nAdditionally, the portion of business that is military related (including an international agency) has in the past fluctuated significantly between years. A significant decrease in military related revenues would adversely affect our results of operations and our cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected by the cyclical nature of its markets.\nA substantial portion of our revenues are attributed to limited number of customers which may decrease or cease purchasing any time, since the Company\u2019s products depends upon the general economic conditions of the markets in which the Company competes. The Company\u2019s sales depend in part upon its customers\u2019 replacement or repair cycles. Adverse economic conditions, including a decrease in commodity prices, may cause customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery. Downward economic cycles may result in reductions in sales of the Company\u2019s products, which may reduce the Company\u2019s profits. The Company has taken a number of steps to reduce its fixed costs and diversify its operations to decrease the negative impact of these cycles. There can be no assurance, however, that these steps will prevent the negative impact of poor economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are attributed to limited number of customers which may decrease or cease purchasing any time.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are attributed to a limited number of customers. We generally do not have long-term supply agreements with our customers. Even if a multi-year contract exists, the customer is not required to commit to minimum purchases and can cease purchasing at any time. If we were to lose either a significant customer or several smaller customers our operating results and cash flows would be adversely impacted.\nThe Company is dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages.\nThe Company obtains materials and manufactured components from third-party suppliers. Any delay in the ability of the Company\u2019s suppliers to provide the Company with necessary materials and components may affect the Company\u2019s capabilities at a number of our manufacturing locations, or may require the Company to seek alternative supply sources. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting the Company\u2019s suppliers including capacity constraints, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition\nof a particular supplier, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any delay in receiving supplies could impair the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products to customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company purchases material and services from suppliers on extended terms based on the Company\u2019s overall credit rating. Negative changes in the Company\u2019s credit rating may impact suppliers\u2019 willingness to extend terms and increase the cash requirements of the business.\nPrice increases in materials could affect our profitability.\nWe use large amounts of steel and other items in the manufacture of our products. In the past, market prices of some of our key raw materials increased significantly. If we experience future significant increases in material costs, including steel, we may not be able to reduce product cost in other areas or pass future raw material price increases on to our customers and our margins could be adversely affected.\nThe Company depends on its information technology systems. If its information technology systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner or if the security of them is breached, it could be disruptive and or adversely affect the operations and results of operations of the Company.\nThe Company depends on its information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. If our information technology systems do not perform in a satisfactory manner, it could be disruptive and or adversely affect the operations and results of operations of the Company, including the ability of the Company to report accurate and timely financial results.\nFurthermore, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. A failure of or breach in information technology security could expose us and our customers, distributors and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability, as well as the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s level of indebtedness reduces financial flexibility and could impede our ability to operate.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company\u2019s total debt was $175.9 million, which includes: revolving term credit facilities, notes payable, convertible debt and capital lease obligations.\nOur level of debt affects our operations in several important ways, including the following:\n\u00b7\na significant portion of our cash flow from operations is likely to be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u00b7\nour cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments; and\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to obtain additional loans as a result of covenants and agreements with existing debt holders.\nThe Company must comply with restrictive covenants in its outstanding debt agreements.\nThe Company\u2019s existing debt agreements contain a number of significant covenants which may limit its ability to, among other things, borrow additional money, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, dispose of assets and acquire new businesses. These covenants also require the Company to meet certain financial tests. The Company is currently in compliance with all active covenants. A default or other event of non-compliance, if not waived or otherwise permitted by the Company\u2019s lenders, could result in acceleration of the Company\u2019s debt and possibly bankruptcy.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s products are significantly affected by the level of capital expenditures in the oil and gas industry and lower capital expenditures have affected and may continue to affect the results of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe demand for our product in part depends on the condition of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, on the level of capital expenditures of companies engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. Capital expenditures by these companies are influenced by the following factors:\n\u00b7\nthe oil and gas industry\u2019s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves in production;\n\u00b7\ncurrent and projected oil and gas prices;\n\u00b7\nthe oil and gas industry\u2019s need to clear all structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted;\n\u00b7\nweather events, such as major tropical storms;\n\u00b7\nthe abilities of oil and gas companies to generate, access and deploy capital;\n\u00b7\nexploration, production and transportation costs;\n\u00b7\nthe discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u00b7\nthe sale and expiration dates of oil and gas leases and concessions;\n\u00b7\nlocal and international political and economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe ability or willingness of host country government entities to fund their budgetary commitments; and\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances.\nHistorically, prices of oil and natural gas and exploration, development and production have fluctuated substantially. A sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies will result in decreased demand for certain equipment produced by the Company, lower margins, and possibly net losses.\nThe Company may face limitations on its ability to integrate acquired businesses.\nThe Company has completed twelve acquisitions since 2006. The successful integration of new businesses depends on the Company\u2019s ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. While the Company believes it has successfully integrated these acquisitions to date, the Company cannot ensure that these acquired companies will operate profitably or that the intended beneficial effect from these acquisitions will be realized.\nIf the Company is unable to manage anticipated growth effectively, the business could be harmed.\nIf the Company fails to manage growth, the Company\u2019s financial results and business prospects may be harmed. To manage the Company\u2019s growth and to execute its business plan efficiently, the Company will need to institute operational, financial and management controls, as well as reporting systems and procedures. The Company also must effectively expand, train and manage its employee base. The Company cannot assure you that it will be successful in any of these endeavors.\nThe Company relies on key management.\nThe Company relies on the management and leadership skills of David Langevin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. When Mr. Langevin joined the Company, he signed a three year employment agreement with the Company which expired on December 31, 2008. Mr. Langevin\u2019s employment agreement has been extended and now expires on December 31, 2018. Under the employment agreement, Mr. Langevin\u2019s employment term automatically extends for successive periods of three year unless either the Company or Mr. Langevin gives written notice to the other party of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the end of the then current employment term. The loss of his services could have a significant and negative impact on the Company\u2019s business. In addition, the Company relies on the management and leadership skills of other senior executives. The Company could be harmed by the loss of key personnel in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon the continued protection of its trademarks and the Company may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain, defend, protect and enforce its intellectual property rights.\nThe Company\u2019s registered and common law trademarks, as well as certain of the Company\u2019s licensed trademarks, have significant value and are instrumental to the Company\u2019s ability to market its products. The Company\u2019s marks \u201cManitex\u201d \u201cLiftking\u201d \u201cBadger\u201d, \u201cSabre\u201d, \u201cValla\u201d, \u201cASV\u201d \u201cPM\u201d and \u201cO&S\u201d are important to the Company\u2019s business as the majority of the Company\u2019s products are sold under those names. The Company has not registered all of its trademarks in the United States nor in the foreign countries where it does business. The Company cannot assure you that third parties will not assert claims against any such intellectual property or that the Company will be able to successfully resolve all such claims. If the Company has to change the names of any of its products, it may experience a loss of goodwill associated with its brand names, customer confusion and a loss of sales.\nIn addition, international protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property may not be available in some foreign countries to the same extent permitted by the laws of the United States. The Company could also incur substantial costs to defend legal actions relating to use of its intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company may be unable to effectively respond to technological change, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and business.\nThe markets served by the Company are not historically characterized by rapidly changing technology. Nevertheless, the Company\u2019s future success will depend in part upon the Company\u2019s ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products. If the Company fails to anticipate or respond adequately to competitors\u2019 product improvements and new production introductions, future results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry and the Company is particularly subject to the risks of such competition.\nThe Company competes in a highly competitive industry and the competition which the Company encounters has an effect on its product prices, market share, revenues and profitability. Because certain competitors have substantially greater financial, production, research and development resources and substantially greater name recognition than the Company, the Company is particularly subject to the risks inherent in competing with them and may be put at a competitive disadvantage. To compete successfully, the Company\u2019s products must excel in terms of quality, price, product line, ease of use, safety and comfort, and the Company must also provide excellent customer service. The greater financial resources of the Company\u2019s competitors may put it at a competitive disadvantage. If competition in the Company\u2019s industry intensifies or if the Company\u2019s current competitors enhance their products or lower their prices for competing products, the Company may lose sales or be required to lower its prices. This may reduce revenue from the Company\u2019s products and services, lower its gross margins or cause the Company to lose market share. The Company may not be able to differentiate our products from those of competitors, successfully develop or introduce less costly products, offer better performance than competitors or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by competitors.\nThe Company faces product liability claims and other liabilities due to the nature of its business.\nIn the Company\u2019s lines of business numerous suits have been filed alleging damages for accidents that have occurred during the use or operation of the Company\u2019s products. The Company is self-insured, up to certain limits, for these product liability exposures, as well as for certain exposures related to general, workers\u2019 compensation and automobile liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic losses as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Any material liabilities not covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nOur increasingly international operations expose us to additional risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.\nThe international expansion of our business may expose us to risks inherent in conducting foreign operations. These risks include:\n\u00b7\nchallenges associated with managing geographically diverse operations, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;\n\u00b7\nthe increased cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange and interest rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions, if we chose to do so in the future;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u00b7\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining protection and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with additional regulations and government authorities in a highly regulated business; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and political conditions internationally.\nThe risks that the Company faces in its international operations may continue to intensify as the Company further develops and expands its international operations.\nThe Company is subject to currency fluctuations.\nChanges in exchange rates between various currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our earnings. We regularly evaluate opportunities for, and at times engage in, hedging activities to mitigate the impact that changes in exchange rates for various currencies may have on our financial results. Our hedging activities are designed to reduce and delay, but not to eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include volatility of currency markets, and the availability of effective hedging instruments. Since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility, they may have the effect of reducing both the negative and positive impacts that changes in exchange rates may have. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar versus the native currencies of our subsidiaries (Canadian dollar and Euro) as well as the native currencies of foreign subsidiaries and other currencies in which they conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, no hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. We currently have exposure to changes in exchange rates for a number of currencies including the Canadian dollar, the Euro, the Chilean peso and the Argentinean peso.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s principal shareholders, executive officers and directors hold a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s common stock, and these shareholders may take actions that may be adverse to your interests.\nThe Company\u2019s principal shareholders, executive officers and directors beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 33 % of the Company\u2019s common stock as of February 1, 2016. As a result, these shareholders, acting together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers, consolidations, sales and purchases of assets. They also could dictate the management of the Company\u2019s business and affairs. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination, which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent you from receiving a premium in such a transaction.\nThe cost of compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may negatively impact the Company\u2019s income.\nThe Company is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC, including those rules and regulations mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires all reporting companies to include in their annual report a statement of management\u2019s responsibilities for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of those internal controls. Section 404 further requires that the reporting company\u2019s independent auditors attest to, and report on, this management assessment. The Company expects its expenses related to its internal and external auditors to be significant. If we fail to maintain a system of adequate controls, it could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nThe price of our common stock is highly volatile.\nThe trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe degree to which the Company successfully implements its business strategy;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of the Company\u2019s revenues or operating results;\n\u00b7\nfailure to meet expectations of industry analysts;\n\u00b7\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7\nstrategic actions by the Company\u2019s competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by the Company or competitors; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in business conditions affecting the Company and its customers.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been brought against companies. If a securities class action suit is filed against us, whether or not meritorious, we would incur substantial legal fees and our management\u2019s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation.\nProvisions of the Michigan Business Corporation Act and the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Rights Agreement may discourage or prevent a takeover of the Company.\nProvisions of the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, Michigan law, and the Rights Agreement, dated October 17, 2008, between the Company and Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solution, Inc., as rights agent, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to you. These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s shares. Because of these provisions, you might not be able to receive a premium on your investment. These provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorize the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, with approval by a majority of its independent Directors but without requiring shareholder consent, to issue shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and prevent a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7\nlimit our shareholders\u2019 ability to call a special meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders;\n\u00b7\nlimit the Company\u2019s shareholders\u2019 ability to amend, alter or repeal the Company bylaws;\n\u00b7\nmay result in the issuance of preferred stock, which would significantly dilute the stock ownership percentage of certain shareholders and make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock; and\n\u00b7\nrestrict business combinations with certain shareholders.\nThe provisions described above could prevent, delay or defer a change in control of the Company or its management.", "PERMNO": 90568, "SIC": 3537, "TIC": "MNTX"}
