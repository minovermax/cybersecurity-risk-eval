{"cik": "1610618", "company": "Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this report and in our public filings, before deciding whether to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time.\nRisks Related to Drug Discovery, Development and Commercialization\nWe depend heavily on the success of rezafungin, currently in Phase 3 clinical development, and we also are very early in our development efforts from our Cloudbreak program, neither of which may be successful.\nWe have completed six Phase 1 clinical trials of rezafungin, as well as the STRIVE Phase 2 clinical trial of rezafungin for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. We are currently conducting two additional Phase 1 clinical trials of rezafungin and the ReSTORE Phase 3 clinical trial of rezafungin for treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. We expect to commence the ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trial of rezafungin for prophylaxis in patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplants initially in Europe and / or Canada in the first quarter of 2020. Commencement of the ReSPECT trial in the US is contingent upon obtaining agreement with the FDA. Completion of our planned Phase 3 trials is contingent on our ability to secure adequate additional funding. We are also conducting preclinical studies of AVCs in our Cloudbreak program for viral infections. Our assumptions about why rezafungin is worthy of continued development, as well as our assumptions about the market for rezafungin or any potential products from our Cloudbreak program, are based on data primarily collected by other companies. The timing and costs of our preclinical and clinical development programs, the likelihood of marketing approval for rezafungin, and the regulatory paths for marketing approval for products from our Cloudbreak program remain uncertain. Our ability to generate product revenue, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. The success of rezafungin and any other product candidates we may develop will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to secure adequate additional funding;\n\u2022\nagreement with regulatory authorities on study design and other requirements for study initiation;\n\u2022\nsuccessful completion of preclinical studies;\n\u2022\nsuccessful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndemonstrating safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nreceipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\n\u2022\nestablishing clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and non-patent exclusivity for our product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nlaunching commercial sales of the product candidates if and when approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance of the product candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022\neffectively competing with other therapies;\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile of the products following approval; and\n\u2022\nenforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.\nIf we do not reach agreement with regulatory authorities on requirements for study initiation, timely enroll the ReSTORE and ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trials, or if we are unable to secure additional funding, we will not be able to complete the Phase 3 clinical development plans for rezafungin. If we do not accomplish one or more of any of the other goals in a timely manner, or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully complete the development of and commercialize our product candidates, which would harm our business.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in the ReSTORE or ReSPECT clinical trials, our timing to complete the rezafungin clinical development program, and therefore our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to complete the ReSTORE or ReSPECT clinical trials if we are unable to identify and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients, as required by the FDA or analogous regulatory authorities outside the United States, or if we do not believe that the number of patients required by such regulatory authorities can be enrolled in a reasonable timeframe.\nOur rezafungin Phase 3 clinical development program is a global program and, as such, our ability to timely enroll the ReSTORE and ReSPECT clinical trials may be affected by many different factors specific to those global localities, such as, delays in our receipt of approval to commence our Phase 3 clinical trials in a particular country from applicable regulatory authorities and ethics committees, timely completion of clinical trial site initiation within each country, delays in local importation and receipt of necessary clinical trial supplies, and our ongoing compliance with local regulations, which may change during the course of the clinical trial. In addition, the ReSTORE and ReSPECT clinical trials are heavily reliant on third-party contractors, including contractors that import clinical trial materials, and contract research organizations that conduct and monitor our clinical trials, and interact with regional or local regulators and ethics committees on our behalf. If we experience significant difficulties with any of our key contractors such that we determine it is in the best interests of the clinical trials to replace a key contractor, this could result in a significant delay in enrollment.\nAdditionally, timely enrollment in the ReSTORE and ReSPECT trials is reliant on global clinical trial sites which may be adversely affected by global health matters, such as pandemics. For example, clinical trial sites located in Asia, including China and South Korea, are an important part of our ReSTORE clinical trial and clinical trial sites located in Europe are an important part of both the ReSTORE and ReSPECT trials, and these regions are currently being afflicted by the COVID-19 coronavirus. Some factors from the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak that we believe have adversely affected enrollment in our Phase 3 trials include:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trial matters to focus on pandemic concerns, including the attention of infectious disease physicians serving as our clinical trial investigators, hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials,;\n\u2022\nlimitations on travel that interrupt key trial activities, such as clinical trial site initiations and monitoring;\n\u2022\ninterruption in global shipping affecting the transport of clinical trial materials, such as investigational drug product and comparator drugs used in our trials; and\n\u2022\nemployee furlough days that delay necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors.\nThese and other factors arising from the COVID-19 coronavirus could worsen in countries that are already afflicted with the virus or could continue to spread to additional countries, each of which may further adversely impact our Phase 3 trials. The global outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus continues to evolve and the conduct of our Phase 3 trials may continue to be adversely affected, despite efforts to mitigate this impact.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nIn addition, some of our competitors may have ongoing or new clinical trials for product candidates that would treat the same indications as rezafungin, or be used in the same patients and, therefore, patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates. Patient enrollment may also be affected by other factors, including:\n\u2022\neligibility criteria, including regional or local practices that place additional limitations on patient eligibility;\n\u2022\navailability, safety and efficacy of approved medications or other investigational medications being studied clinically for the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of rezafungin;\n\u2022\nefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nreluctance of physicians to encourage patient participation in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in maintaining an adequate supply of quality drug product for use in clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nchanging treatment patterns that may reduce the burden of disease which rezfungin addresses.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a reasonable timeframe may require us to abandon the entire rezafungin Phase 3 clinical development program or terminate one of our Phase 3 clinical trials. Enrollment delays in ReSTORE or ReSPECT will result in increased development costs, which could cause the value of our company to decline and could limit our ability to obtain necessary additional financing.\nIf clinical trials for rezafungin or any other product candidates are delayed, terminated or suspended, or fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities, we may incur additional costs, or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A delay in starting or completing our clinical trials would materially impact our timelines and our ability to complete development of our product candidates in a timely manner or at all. For example, our ability to complete our rezafungin Phase 3 development program is dependent on our ability to secure adequate additional funding, and our ability to commence the ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trial is also subject to the approval of the regulatory authorities.\nA failure of one or more clinical trials could occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a particular clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results of that trial. For example, although the STRIVE Phase 2 clinical trial met its primary objectives related to tolerability and safety of rezafungin in the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, this does not guarantee success in our ReSTORE Phase 3 clinical trial for treatment, nor does it indicate whether our planned ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trial for prophylaxis will be successful.\nMoreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to multiple interpretations and analyses. Many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. For example, the historically observed high rate of correlation for clinical efficacy for anti-infectives based on preclinical data may not apply for our current or future product candidates, and any of the potential benefits that we anticipate for human clinical use may not be realized.\nWe do not know whether our ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trial for prophylaxis will begin on time or at all, or whether either ReSTORE or ReSPECT will be completed on schedule, or at all. We may experience numerous unforeseen events that could delay or prevent our ability to commence or complete our clinical trials, which could then delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial on our expected timeline, or at all, or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site or in a given country;\n\u2022\nregulators may disagree with our interpretation of preclinical data, which may impact our ability to commence our trials on our expected timeline or at all;\n\u2022\nregulators may require that trials or studies be conducted, or sized or otherwise designed in ways, that were unforeseen in order to begin planned studies or to obtain marketing authorization;\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\n\u2022\nwe may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials, modify planned clinical trial designs or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nenrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, clinical sites may drop out of our clinical trials or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nregulators, institutional review boards or the data safety monitoring board assembled by us to oversee our rezafungin clinical trials may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks due to serious and unexpected side effects;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could require that we perform more studies than, or evaluate clinical endpoints other than, those that we currently expect;\n\u2022\nthe supply of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed or insufficient, or the quality of such materials may be inadequate; and\n\u2022\nwe may be required to delay or terminate studies due to financial constraints.\nWe plan to conduct an interim futility analysis for our ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trial for prophylaxis after primary endpoint data is available for approximately 50% of the total subjects we intend to enroll. The futility analysis will be conducted based on conditional power. If the conditional power is below a pre-specified cutoff for both primary endpoints, the study may be stopped for futility.\nWe are also in discussions with regulatory authorities about the final trial design of, and other matters related to, our ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trial for prophylaxis. These discussions and potential design changes could lead to delays in the commencement and completion of the ReSPECT trial, or may result in the trial not proceeding at all.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials, or other tests of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other tests successfully or in a timely manner, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u2022\nbe subject to significant restrictions on reimbursement from public and/or private payors; or\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nProduct development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or in receiving marketing approvals. We do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates, could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, could increase competition from generics of the same class, and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, any of which may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf serious adverse effects or unexpected characteristics of our product candidates are identified during development, we may need to abandon or limit our development of some or all of our product candidates.\nBecause it is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval, the risk of each of our programs is high. If our product candidates are associated with\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nundesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. For example, the pharmacokinetic properties, such as a longer half-life or less frequent dosing regimen, that differentiate rezafungin from other echinocandins could have side effects that we have not anticipated and the consequences of such side effects could be more severe than have been seen with other echinocandins that have shorter half-lives or more frequent dosing regimens, or are dosed at lower concentrations than we expect for rezafungin.\nFurther, the treatment advantages that we are predicting for rezafungin, such as lower healthcare costs resulting from an ability to administer rezafungin once-weekly or the predicted ability of rezafungin to be effective against resistant strains of fungal pathogens, may not be realized. For our AVCs, the bispecific mechanism of action, including the use of the immune system, may lead to side effects that are not anticipated based on the preclinical work we have conducted to date.\nIn the biotechnology industry, many agents that initially show promise in early stage testing may later be found to cause side effects that prevent further development of the agents. In addition, infections can occur in patients with co-morbidities and weakened immune systems, and there may be adverse events and deaths in our clinical trials that are attributable to factors other than investigational use of our product candidates.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe have limited financial resources. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential than opportunities we pursue. For example, because we believe that an NDA filing for rezafungin for prophylaxis can be supported by one Phase 3 trial in prophylaxis, together with the data from our Phase 3 clinical trial in the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis and the remainder of our rezafungin treatment program, if financial constraints require us to choose between our planned rezafungin treatment and prophylaxis programs, we may be required to choose our treatment program and forego or delay our prophylaxis program.\nOur resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target markets for a particular product candidate or opportunity, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate or opportunity through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate or opportunity.\nEven if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community for us to achieve commercial success. If our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate sufficient product revenue to become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative therapies;\n\u2022\nthe size of the markets in the countries in which approvals are obtained;\n\u2022\nterms, limitations or warnings contained in any labeling approved by the FDA or other regulatory authority;\n\u2022\nour ability to offer any approved products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nconvenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies or dosing regimens;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of physicians to prescribe these therapies and, in the case of rezafungin, transition to a once-weekly dosing regimen from traditional once-daily dosing;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe success of competing products and the marketing efforts of our competitors;\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\n\u2022\nsufficient third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement; and\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects.\nIf, in the future, we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or to selectively enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates, if and when they are approved.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties.\nThere are risks involved both with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and with entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly and our investment would be lost if we cannot reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates on our own include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or to achieve adequate numbers of prescriptions for any future products; and\n\u2022\ncosts and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenue or the profitability of these product revenues to us may be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We may have little control over such third parties and any of them may fail to market and sell our products effectively, including by failing to devote the necessary resources and attention. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Regulatory incentives to develop drugs for treatment of infectious diseases have increased interest and activity in this area and will lead to increased competition for clinical investigators and clinical trial subjects, as well as for future prescriptions, if any of our product candidates are successfully developed and approved. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the indications on which we are focusing our product development efforts. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nWe expect that rezafungin will primarily compete with certain antifungal classes of drugs, which include polyenes, azoles and echinocandins. Approved branded echinocandin antifungal therapies include Cancidas (caspofungin, marketed by Merck & Co.), Eraxis (anidulafungin, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.), and Mycamine (micafungin, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc.). We expect that there will be generics of all of the current echinocandins available at the time of rezafungin market approval, which will create added competition. In addition, there are other generic products approved for candidemia, marketed by companies such as Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Mylan Inc. and Glenmark Generics Inc., among others. In addition to approved therapies, we expect that rezafungin will compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, such as SCY-078, being developed by Scynexis, Inc.\nWe expect that any influenza product candidates developed through our Cloudbreak antiviral program will compete against approved and investigational agents for the treatment or prevention of viral influenza infections, including neurominidase inhibitors such as Tamiflu, Relenza and Peramivir, and endonuclease inhibitors such as Xofluza. We may develop other product candidates through our Cloudbreak platform for the treatment of other invasive infections. We are aware of a number of approved and investigational therapies in these areas.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nOur competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition, financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These same competitors may invent technology that competes with our rezafungin program or our Cloudbreak platform.\nThese third parties may compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, preliminary or topline data from our clinical studies, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analysis of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. For example, we reported topline data from Part B of our STRIVE Phase 2 clinical trial in July 2019. The topline data was reported as positive, however, if the final data materially differs in an adverse manner from the topline data, we may have unnecessarily expended or continued to commit substantial resources to the Phase 3 clinical trials, which costs we may not be able to recover. From time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our clinical studies. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. For example, we plan to conduct an interim futility analysis after primary endpoint data is available for approximately 50% of the subjects that we intend to enroll in the ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trial. There can be no guarantee that a favorable futility analysis will result in a favorable final result at the completion of the clinical trial.\nFurther, others, including regulatory authorities, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, drug candidate or our business. If the topline data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nEven if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, these products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. In the United States, new and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product-licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial marketing approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\napproval for a drug in a particular country but then be subject to price regulations that delay its commercial launch, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenue we are able to generate from the sale of the drug in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any product candidates successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health programs, private health insurers, integrated delivery networks and other third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A significant trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of payment for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient for commercial success. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Coverage and reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the medical circumstances under which it is used may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products or procedures or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Commercial third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded programs and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize our approved products and our overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit the commercialization of any product candidates we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and we will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that receive marketing approval. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for any product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs and distraction of management to defend any related litigation;\n\u2022\nthe initiation of investigations by regulatory bodies;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products we may develop.\nAlthough we have product liability insurance for our clinical trials, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We anticipate that we will need to increase our insurance coverage as we continue or expand our clinical trials and if we successfully commercialize any products. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees in our workplace, including those resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, chemical, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify, discover, and develop potential product candidates through our Cloudbreak platform or otherwise.\nThrough our Cloudbreak platform, we are developing AVCs for the treatment of viral infections. We have nominated the AVC CD377 as our lead Cloudbreak development candidate for influenza. It is structurally similar to previously announced development candidates. Our Cloudbreak platform may not be successful in identifying additional AVCs that could be developed as drug therapies. In addition, our Cloudbreak platform may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons. In particular, our research methodology used may not be successful in identifying compounds with sufficient potency, bioavailability or efficacy to be potential product candidates. In addition, our potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other negative characteristics.\nResearch programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical expertise and human resources. For example, we have limited experience with the use of the Cloudbreak platform applied to viral pathogens. A failure to optimize our expertise using the Cloudbreak platform for the development of our Cloudbreak antiviral program may limit our ability to successfully advance this program and identify future product candidates. Research programs to identify new product candidates also require substantial financial resources. We may choose to expend our financial resources on potential product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. If we are unable to develop successful product candidates from our Cloudbreak platform for preclinical and clinical development, we will not be able to generate product revenue, which would harm our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe need substantial additional funding to complete the development of rezafungin and to advance our Cloudbreak program.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2019, we performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern. We believe, based on our current business plan, that our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our obligations for the next twelve months. Our ability to continue to fund the development of rezafungin through completion of our planned Phase 3 trials depends on our ability to obtain additional funding. Our ability to advance our Cloudbreak program is also dependent on our ability to obtain additional funding.\nOn September 3, 2019, we entered into a collaboration and development agreement for rezafungin with Mundipharma Medical Company, the Mundipharma Collaboration, pursuant to which we granted Mundipharma exclusive commercialization rights to rezafungin outside the U.S. and Japan in exchange for a $30 million upfront payment, near-term funding to support the global Phase 3 ReSTORE and ReSPECT trials, and the potential to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and double-digit royalties on product net sales. The Mundipharma Collaboration requires, among other things, that we complete the rezafungin development program. Our ability to meet our development obligations under the rezafungin collaboration depends on our ability to obtain additional funding.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nThere can be no assurance that additional funds will be available from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. There can also be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us without first obtaining the approval of our stockholders, which can be a difficult and lengthy process with an uncertain outcome.\nEven if we raise additional capital, our expenses may increase in connection with our ongoing activities beyond what is currently expected. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing to complete our Phase 3 ReSTORE and Phase 3 ReSPECT clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of any regulatory review of rezafungin or future development candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations, when and if necessary, on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for rezafungin or any future product candidates that receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, manufacturing development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates, for the Cloudbreak platform; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.\nIdentifying potential development candidates and conducting preclinical studies, manufacturing development and clinical trials are time consuming, expensive and uncertain processes that take years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales for any of our current or future product candidates. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all.\nAccordingly, we need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations and to achieve our goals. Since December 6, 2012 (inception) through December 31, 2019, our operations have been financed primarily by gross proceeds of approximately $309.1 million from equity and debt financings, grant funding and the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $60.3 million.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital on attractive terms or at all, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our development programs, including our Cloudbreak program, be unable to continue the development of rezafungin, complete the ReSTORE and ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trials and meet our development obligations under the Mundipharma collaboration and/or be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, and/or liquidate or grant rights to assets where possible. Any of these actions could materially harm our business, results of operations and future prospects.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity, debt or other financing structures, receipt of payments under the Mundipharma collaboration agreement, as well as potentially entering into other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties or receiving government and/or charitable grants or contracts. In November 2018, we entered into a new controlled equity offering sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. with an aggregate offering price of up to $35 million and, other than the Mundipharma collaboration, it is our only current committed external source of funds, subject to the fulfillment of specified conditions.\nIn September 2019, we issued $9.0 million of our common stock to Mundipharma in connection with entering into the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement. In February 2020, we issued $30.0 million of our common stock and series X preferred stock upon the closing of a rights offering. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, like the sale of our common stock to Munipharma, the sale of our common stock and Series X Preferred stock issued in our rights offering or the sale of common stock under our controlled equity offering sales agreement, your ownership interest will be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may be secured by all or a portion of our assets.\nIf we raise funds by entering into collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. On September 3, 2019, we licensed all rights to rezafungin outside of the United States and Japan to Mundipharma Medical Company in exchange for certain payments and\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nroyalties on net sales. We may need to enter into similar agreements with other third parties for the development and commercialization of rezafungin outside of the Mundipharma territory, or for the development of our Cloudbreak program, which may require we relinquish valuable rights to these products.\nIf we raise funds through government grants and contracts, we may be subject to restrictions on our operations or certain unfavorable terms. United States government grants and contracts, if available, typically contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to audit and modification by the government at its sole discretion, which will subject us to additional risks. If we receive a United States government grant or contract, we would be required to comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of the grant or contract, which can make it more difficult for us to retain our rights under such grant or contract and result in increased costs.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds through equity, debt or other financing structures, or through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, or through receiving government and/or charitable grants or contracts, we may be required to delay, reduce or terminate our rezafungin development program, including our ReSTORE and ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trials, be unable to meet our development obligations under the Mundipharma collaboration, and be unable to continue advancing the Cloudbreak program or be forced to grant rights in the Cloudbreak program that we would otherwise prefer to retain for ourselves.\nThe terms of our term loan facility place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility, and failure to comply with covenants or to satisfy certain conditions of the agreement governing the debt facility may result in acceleration of our repayment obligations and foreclosure on our pledged assets, which could significantly harm our liquidity, financial condition, operating results, business and prospects and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIn October 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Pacific Western, or the Loan Agreement, as amended in June 2018, July 2018 and November 2019 under which we borrowed $10.0 million, subject to certain terms and conditions set forth therein.\nThe outstanding principal balance under the Loan Agreement is secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than intellectual property, which is subject to a double negative pledge. The Loan Agreement requires us to comply with a number of customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, including covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: transfer any part of our business or property; merge or consolidate with another entity or otherwise experience a change in control, incur additional indebtedness, encumber the collateral securing the loan, declare or pay any cash dividend or make distributions on our capital stock, repurchase or redeem any class of stock or other equity interest, acquire, own or make investments, and make certain capitalized expenditures over a specified threshold, in each case subject to exceptions.\nThe Loan Agreement also includes standard events of default, including a provision that Pacific Western could declare an event of default upon the occurrence of any event that it interprets as having a material adverse effect on (i) our operations, business or financial condition and subsidiaries taken as a whole; (ii) our ability to perform or pay the secured obligations under the Loan Agreement and related agreements; or (iii) the collateral pledged to Pacific Western under the Loan Agreement. Upon such determination, Pacific Western could declare all obligations under the Loan Agreement immediately due and payable. In November 2019, we entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement that requires we maintain the cash value of the amounts borrowed on hand in our bank account, and a failure to comply with this obligation will also constitute an event of default and allow Pacific Western to declare all obligations immediately due and payable.\nIn connection with the audit of our 2019 financial statements, we received an unqualified auditor opinion with a going concern explanatory paragraph. Pacific Western may determine that the underlying circumstances resulting in the receipt of a going concern explanatory note in the auditor opinion for our 2019 financial statements either on their own, or together with contemporaneous events or circumstances, such as a failure to timely secure additional funding, constitute a material adverse effect upon our business, operations, properties, assets, or financial condition or upon our ability to perform or pay the secured obligations under the Loan Agreement.\nAdditionally, Pacific Western may determine that the occurrence of adverse results or delays in any clinical study or the denial, delay or limitation of approval of or taking of any other regulatory action by the FDA or another governmental entity may also constitute a material adverse effect upon our business, operations, properties, assets, or financial condition or upon our ability to perform or pay the secured obligations under the Loan Agreement, either on its own or together with contemporaneous events or circumstances, such as our status regarding going concern or a failure to timely secure additional funding.\nThe Loan Agreement also requires us to timely deliver certain financial statements, reports, and certificates including a requirement to provide audited annual financial statements together with an unqualified audit opinion or a qualified opinion only for going concern so long as our investors provide additional equity as needed or if Pacific Western otherwise provides its consent in writing.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nIf we default under the facility, Pacific Western may accelerate all of our repayment obligations. At such time, we may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds on satisfactory terms, if at all, through equity or debt financings to repay our indebtedness at the time any such repayment is required. If we are unable to access funds to meet those obligations or to renegotiate the Loan Agreement, Pacific Western could take control of and may sell our pledged assets. In such an event, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. If our assets were liquidated, Pacific Western\u2019s right to repayment would be senior to the rights of our stockholders to receive any proceeds from the liquidation. Any declaration by Pacific Western of an event of default could significantly harm our liquidity, financial condition, operating results, business, and prospects and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The debt instruments governing such indebtedness may contain provisions that are as, or more, restrictive than the provisions governing our existing indebtedness under the Loan Agreement. If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness when payment is due, the lenders could proceed against the collateral or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $41.1 million, $59.0 million and $55.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $259.8 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes, our initial public offering of our common stock, or our IPO, our October 2016 term loan facility with Pacific Western Bank, or Pacific Western, our October 2016 follow-on public offering of common stock, our October 2017 private placement of common stock, sales of common stock during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 under our controlled equity offering sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., which has since been terminated, our May 2018 registered direct offering of common stock, the payments received in connection with the Mundipharma Collaboration, the sale of our common stock to Mundipharma AG, sales of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 under our new controlled equity offering sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co and sales of our common stock and series X preferred stock in connection with the closing of our rights offering in February 2020. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development. We have completed the STRIVE Phase 2 clinical trial of rezafungin, and are currently conducting the ReSTORE Phase 3 clinical trial of rezafungin, Phase 1 and non-clinical studies of rezafungin, and preclinical studies of our AVCs, and we are planning to commence the ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trial of rezafungin for prophylaxis. We expect that it will be many years, if ever, before we receive regulatory approval and have a product candidate available for commercialization. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022\nsubmit INDs to the FDA and equivalent filings to other regulatory authorities, and seek approval of our clinical protocols by institutional review boards, or IRBs, at clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ncontinue to advance rezafungin through clinical development;\n\u2022\ncontinue the preclinical development of our AVCs from our Cloudbreak platform or otherwise, and advance one or more of such product candidates into clinical trials;\n\u2022\nseek marketing approvals for rezafungin and other product candidates;\n\u2022\nestablish or contract for a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022\nmaintain, expand and enforce our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nhire additional manufacturing, clinical, regulatory, quality assurance and scientific personnel;\n\u2022\nadd operational, financial and management systems and personnel, including personnel to support product development; and\n\u2022\nacquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize one or more products with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenue that is significant or large enough to achieve profitability. Our failure to become and remain profitable\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nwould decrease our value and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. The recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the recent global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. This is particularly true in Europe, which is undergoing a continued severe economic crisis. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom, or the U.K., from the EU, commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" may adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of our current or future products in the U.K or the EU, result in restrictions or imposition of taxes and duties for importing our products into the EU, and may require us to incur additional expenses in order to develop, manufacture and commercialize our products in the U.K. or the EU.\nIn January 2020, the U.K. and EU entered into a withdrawal agreement pursuant to which the U.K. formally withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020. Following such withdrawal, the U.K. entered into a transition period scheduled to end on December 31, 2020, or the Transition Period. During the transition period, the U.K. will remain subject to EU law and maintain access to the EU single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. There remains substantial uncertainty surrounding the ultimate impact of Brexit and any associated transition period.\nThe ultimate effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to EU markets, either during the Transition Period or more permanently. These outcomes could disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and create uncertainty and challenges (particularly in the near term) with respect to trading relationships between our U.K. subsidiary and other EU nations. Remaining EU member countries may also seek to make it more difficult for us to trade effectively or competitively in those regions.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the U.K. is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially change the regulatory regime applicable to our operations and those of our collaborators, including with respect to potential future marketing authorizations for our current and future products. Although during the Transition Period European Union rules will continue to apply, Brexit may lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent laws and regulations between the U.K. and the EU as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replicate or replace. We cannot predict whether or not the U.K. will significantly alter its current laws and regulations in respect of the pharmaceutical industry and, if so, what impact any such alteration would have on us or our business.\nFurther, there is considerable uncertainty resulting from a lack of precedent and the complexity of the U.K. and EU\u2019s intertwined legal regimes as to how Brexit will impact the life sciences industry in Europe, including with respect to ongoing or future clinical trials. The impact will largely depend on the model and means by which the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU is governed post Brexit. For example, following Brexit, the U.K. will no longer be covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorization from the EMA and, unless a specific agreement is entered into, a separate process for authorization of drug products, including our product candidates, will be required in the U.K., the potential process for which is currently unclear. Brexit may adversely affect and delay our ability to commercialize, market and sell our product candidates in the U.K. Brexit may also result in a reduction of funding to the EMA if the U.K. no longer makes financial contributions to European institutions, such as the EMA. If U.K. funding is so reduced, it could create delays in the EMA issuing regulatory approvals for our product candidates and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results or prospects.\nMoreover, there is currently considerable uncertainty in relation to U.K. financial and banking markets in the U.K. following the Transition Period. Furthermore, the U.K. is likely to lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members, which may result in increased trade barriers and could make it more difficult for us and our collaborators to do business in the U.K. In addition, currency exchange rates for the British Pound and the Euro with respect to each other and the U.S. dollar have already been affected by Brexit. Should this foreign exchange volatility continue, it could cause volatility in our quarterly financial results. In any event, we cannot predict to what extent these changes will impact our business or results of operations, or our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to continue to conduct operations in Europe or our ability to build and maintain a commercial infrastructure in Europe.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nOur short operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and assess our future viability.\nWe were founded in December 2012 and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential development and product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete large-scale, pivotal clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our product candidates, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Typically, it takes many years to develop one new product from the time it is discovered to when it is commercially available. Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or if we had product candidates in advanced clinical trials.\nIn addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors that may alter or delay our plans. We will need to continue to transition from a company with a research focus to a company capable of supporting late-stage development activities and, if a product candidate is approved, a company with commercial activities. We may not be successful in any step of such a transition.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe are dependent on our collaboration partner to provide funding to continue the development of rezafungin, and for the commercialization of rezafungin outside of the United States and Japan. If the collaboration is not successful, we may not be able to complete the development of rezafungin or capitalize on the full market potential for rezafungin.\nOn September 3, 2019, we licensed the rights to rezafungin outside of the U.S. and Japan to Mundipharma Medical Company, a large international pharmaceutical company. Our ability to complete the development of rezafungin is dependent, in part, on funds provided by Mundipharma. Additionally, our ability to receive payments from this arrangement will depend on Mundipharma\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize rezafungin in its territory.\nThe Mundipharma Collaboration poses many risks to us, including that our collaborator, Mundipharma:\n\u2022\nhas significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources it will apply to commercializing rezafungin in its territory, and may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of rezafungin;\n\u2022\nmay terminate the collaboration agreement at will;\n\u2022\nmay be subject to changes in key personnel or strategic focus, have limited available funding or be subject to other external factors diverting resources or creates competing priorities, all of which could negatively impact the commercialization of rezafungin in its territory;\n\u2022\nmay independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with rezafungin if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022\nmay use our intellectual property or proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\nmay not agree with certain development decisions resulting in the delay or termination of the program, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u2022\ncould be involved in a business combination and the continued pursuit and emphasis on rezafungin could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf our ability to generate revenue under the Mundipharma Collaboration is adversely impacted by these or any other risks, our right to receive additional payments from the Mundipharma Collaboration, including our share of the revenues generated by net sales of rezafungin, if approved, could be insufficient to allow us to complete the rezafungin development program including the ReSTORE and ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trials, to achieve or maintain profitability or may result in rezafungin being less valuable to us than if we had not entered into the Collaboration.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nWe may seek to selectively establish other collaborations and, if we are unable to establish them on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may have to alter our research, clinical development and commercialization plans.\nWe may seek to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to advance the Cloudbreak program, or for the completion of development and commercialization of rezafungin in the U.S. and Japan. We may also seek funding from government grants or contracts to advance the Cloudbreak program. We cannot be certain that we would be successful in completing any such collaboration or obtaining any such government grants or contracts, or completing any of them on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate pharmaceutical or biotech collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, on the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors.\nThose factors may include:\n\u2022\nthe design or results of preclinical studies, CMC development activities or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u2022\nthe potential market for the product candidate in the territories that are the subject of the collaboration;\n\u2022\nthe costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients;\n\u2022\nthe potential of competing products;\n\u2022\nthe existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge; and\n\u2022\nindustry and market conditions generally.\nThe collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate.\nWe also face significant competition for government grants and contracts for the Cloudbreak program, and there can be no assurances that such funding would be available to us if and when needed, or at all. For instance, government funding may be available only at certain phases of research and development, such as only after Phase 1 clinical trials have been completed. In order to advance the Cloudbreak Program, we will need to obtain significant funding to complete IND-enabling studies, manufacturing development and Phase 1 clinical trials. Government grants and contracts may not be available to fund our activities at this earlier phase of the research and development process.\nWe intend to continue to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and to conduct some aspects of our research and preclinical testing and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials, research or testing.\nWe currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, contract manufacturers of clinical supplies, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct our clinical trials and to conduct some aspects of our research and preclinical testing. Many of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA and other international regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, available at www.clinicaltrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nWe have no experience manufacturing product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale and will be dependent on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates. If we experience problems with any of these third parties, they could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or our ability to sell any approved products.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials and for commercial supply of any of these product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nWe may be unable to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers for preclinical, clinical or commercial supply on terms favorable to us, or at all. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party, including the inability to supply sufficient quantities or to meet quality standards or timelines; and\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with current U.S. Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs, or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with cGMPs or other applicable regulations, even if such failures do not relate specifically to our product candidates or approved products, could result in sanctions being imposed on us or the manufacturers, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could adversely affect supplies of our product candidates and harm our business and results of operations.\nAny product that we develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to these manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMPs and that might be capable of manufacturing for us.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers, including a failure that may not relate specifically to our product candidate or approved product, could delay clinical development or marketing approval or adversely impact our ability to generate commercial sales. If any one of our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace that manufacturer.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or products may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to release, label, store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of these third parties, including a failure that may not relate specifically to our product candidate or approved product, could delay or otherwise adversely impact clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our drugs, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential revenue.\nMoreover, our manufacturers and suppliers may experience difficulties related to their overall businesses and financial stability, which could result in delays or interruptions of supply of our product candidates or approved products.\nWe do not have alternate manufacturing plans in place at this time. If we need to change to other manufacturers, the FDA and comparable foreign regulators may have to approve these manufacturers\u2019 facilities and processes prior to our use, which would require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, the new manufacturers would have to be educated in or independently develop the processes necessary for production. This would result in delays and costs, and in the case of approved products, the potential loss of revenue.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nIf we are unable to take full advantage of regulatory programs designed to expedite drug development or provide other incentives, our development programs may be adversely impacted.\nThere are a number of incentive programs administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies to facilitate development of drugs in areas of unmet medical need. Rezafungin received the designations as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, a fast track product, and an orphan drug in the U.S. for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. Rezafungin also received QIPD and Fast Track designation in the U.S. for the prevention of invasive fungal\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\ninfections in adults undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We plan to seek designation as an orphan drug in the U.S. and Europe for the prophylaxis indication and we also plan to seek orphan drug designation for rezafungin for treatment in Europe. Our product candidates may not qualify for or maintain designations under these or other incentive programs under any of the FDA\u2019s existing or future programs to expedite drug development in areas of unmet medical need. Our inability to fully take advantage of these incentive programs may require us to run larger trials, incur delays, lose opportunities that may not otherwise be available to us, lose marketing exclusivity for which we would otherwise be eligible and incur greater expense in the development of our product candidates.\nIf we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize, or will be delayed in commercializing, our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, release, safety, efficacy, regulatory filings, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. For example, in order to commence clinical trials of our product candidates in the United States, we must file an IND and obtain FDA agreement to proceed. The FDA may place our development program on clinical hold and require further preclinical testing prior to allowing our clinical trials to proceed.\nWe must obtain marketing approval in each jurisdiction in which we market our products. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not submitted a marketing application or received approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process. Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the various regulatory authorities for each indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process, testing and release and inspection of manufacturing facilities and personnel by the relevant regulatory authority. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and elsewhere, is expensive, may take many years and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. We cannot assure you that we will ever obtain any marketing approvals in any jurisdiction. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical or other studies, changes in the manufacturing process or facilities or clinical trials. Moreover, approval by the FDA or an equivalent foreign authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in any other countries or jurisdictions, but a failure to obtain marketing approval in one jurisdiction may adversely impact the likelihood of approval in other jurisdictions. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical testing, manufacturing and product testing and clinical trials could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Additionally, any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes and facilities, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of promotional materials and safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements for product facilities, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and related recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the medicine. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure that they are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nprovisions of the approved labeling. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the product\u2019s FDA approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we do not comply with these restrictions, we may be subject to enforcement actions.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes and facilities or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes or facilities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling, marketing, distribution or use of a product;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-approval clinical trials, other studies or other post-approval commitments;\n\u2022\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nrecall of products;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nOur relationships with customers, health care professionals and third-party payors may be subject to applicable healthcare laws, which could expose us to penalties, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations and diminished future profits and earnings.\nHealthcare professionals and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with customers, healthcare professionals and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct research, market, sell and distribute our medicines for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following, among others:\n\u2022\nthe federal healthcare anti-kickback statute, which prohibits persons and entities from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal false claims laws, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions under the federal civil False Claims Act, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal false statements statute enacted under HIPAA, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022\nthe federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act, which require, among other things, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to CMS information related to payments to physicians, as defined by such law, and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; and\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business activities, including sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services including, in some states, those reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, some state laws which require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and other health care providers and entities, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nAs of May 25, 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR replaced the EU General Data Protection Regulation with respect to the processing of personal data in the European Union. The GDPR imposes many requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to \u20ac20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data and creates additional rights for data subjects. Additionally, in June 2016, United Kingdom voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d which could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. In March 2017, the United Kingdom began the process to leave the EU by April 2019. While the Data Protection Act of 2018, that \u201cimplements\u201d and complements the GDPR has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. We may incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable EU Member States and the United Kingdom privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Interpretations of standards of compliance under these laws and regulations are rapidly changing and subject to varying interpretations and it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could diminish our future profits or earnings. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data, which exposes us to data security risks.\nWe are dependent upon our own or third-party information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems may make them vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, disruption of data integrity, malicious intrusion, or random attacks. Likewise, data privacy or security incidents or breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. A security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to litigation or other liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, any of which could disrupt our business and/or result in increased costs or loss of revenue. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nrisk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have invested, and continue to invest, in the protection of our data and information technology infrastructure, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to data privacy, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and the protection of personal information. These laws and regulations govern our processing of personal data, including the collection, access, use, analysis, modification, storage, transfer, security breach notification, destruction and disposal of personal data. There are foreign and state law versions of these laws and regulations to which we are currently and/or may in the future, be subject. For example, the collection and use of personal health data in the EU is governed by the GDPR. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States, provides an enforcement authority and imposes large monetary penalties for noncompliance. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information within our company, including employee information. The GDPR and similar data privacy laws of other jurisdictions place significant responsibilities on us and create potential liability in relation to personal data that we or our third party service providers process, including in clinical trials conducted in the United States and EU. In addition, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.\nWe are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations, which can harm our business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States, to sell our products abroad once we enter a commercialization phase and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors and other collaborators, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system, including cost-containment measures, that could reduce or limit coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nFor example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, a sweeping law intended to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Affordable Care Act\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nand subsequent regulations revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal and replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act and we expect such challenges to continue. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been enacted. The Tax Act includes a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d Further, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated \"Cadillac\" tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans and also increased, effective January 1, 2019, the percentage that a drug manufacturer must discount the cost of prescription drugs from 50 percent to 70 percent. In 2018, CMS published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \"individual mandate\" was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.\nAlthough the full effect of the Affordable Care Act remains uncertain, the law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products.\nFurther, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the President signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nIn addition, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. Further, the Trump administration released a \u201cBlueprint,\u201d or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS, has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning on January 1, 2020. The final rule codified a CMS policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. While some of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nAdditionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients with life-threatening diseases or conditions to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA approval under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.\nWe expect that additional healthcare reform measures will be adopted within and outside the United States in the future, any of which could add difficulty to the regulatory approval processes for our product candidates or limit the amounts that governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. The continuing efforts of third-party payors to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect the demand for any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products, our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product, our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability and the level of taxes that we are required to pay.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to rezafungin, our Cloudbreak compounds or our other product candidates or compounds are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to rezafungin and our other product candidates and compounds. Any involuntary disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our markets.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain and our commercial success will depend on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection for rezafungin, our AVCs and other compounds and product candidates in the United States and other countries. We currently hold issued U.S. utility and foreign patents and multiple pending U.S. utility patent applications, pending U.S. provisional patent applications and pending international, foreign national and regional counterpart patent applications covering various aspects of rezafungin and our AVCs. The patent applications may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries or jurisdictions. Even if the applications do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the patents.\nFurther, the existing and/or future patents, if any, may be too narrow to prevent third parties from developing or designing around these patents. If the sufficiency of the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patent and patent applications we own with respect to rezafungin or our AVCs or the patents we pursue related to any of our other product candidates or compounds is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop and threaten our ability to commercialize the product candidates or compounds. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection would be reduced, although a patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate having varied scope may be available in certain jurisdictions to compensate for some of the lost patent term. In addition, we do not know whether:\n\u2022\nwe were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or our issued patents;\n\u2022\nwe were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers will independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nany of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\n\u2022\nany of our patents, once issued, will be valid or enforceable or will issue with claims sufficient to protect our products, or will be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages;\n\u2022\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n\u2022\nthe patents of others will have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act and, in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective in March 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable in one or more jurisdictions, inventions for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug discovery program that involve proprietary know-how, information and technology that is not covered by patents. Although we require all of our employees, consultants, advisers and third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information and technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that this know-how, information and technology will not be disclosed or used in an unauthorized manner or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques.\nThere also may be challenges or other disputes concerning the inventorship, ownership or right to use our intellectual property. For example, our consultants and advisors may have obligations to assign certain inventions and/or know-how that they develop to third-party entities in certain instances, and these third parties may challenge our ownership or other rights to our intellectual property, which would adversely affect our business.\nAn inability to obtain, enforce and defend patents covering our proprietary technologies would materially and adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may encounter significant problems in protecting, enforcing and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties or are otherwise unable to protect, enforce or defend our intellectual property, we will not be able to establish or, if established, maintain a competitive advantage in our markets, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various foreign or jurisdictional governmental patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm to pay these fees due to foreign patent agencies. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process.\nWe employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. Such noncompliance events are outside of our direct control for (1) non-U.S. patents and patent applications owned by us and, (2) if applicable in the future, patents and patent applications licensed to us by another entity. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our drug discovery and development efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents with claims to materials, methods of manufacture or methods of treatment related to the use or manufacture of rezafungin, our AVCs and/or our other product candidates or compounds. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the rezafungin or AVC manufacturing process, any molecules formed during these processes or the final products or any use thereof, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the product unless we obtained a license under the applicable patent or patents or until such patents expire. These same issues and risks arise in connection with any other product candidates we develop as well. We cannot predict whether we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any inability to obtain such a license under the applicable patents on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize the affected product until such patents expire.\nIn addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that our product candidates and/or the use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees in the case of willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties and/or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible and/or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In addition, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all. In that event, we would not be able to further develop and commercialize such product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.\nWe may be required to file lawsuits or take other actions to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our current or future patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one or more of our asserted patents is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Pursuit of these claims would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business.\nInterference proceedings or derivative proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the entitlement to patent protection with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could result in a loss of our patent rights and could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Litigation or patent office proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws or legal process may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIssued patents covering our product candidates and technologies could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or the USPTO.\nIf we initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates or our technologies, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate or our technology, as applicable, is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nUnited States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates or our technologies. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and/or unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art or that prior art that was cited during prosecution, but not relied on by the patent examiner, will not be revisited. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection directed to our product candidates or technologies. Such a loss of patent rights could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and are therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has implemented wide-ranging patent reform legislation, including patent office administrative proceedings that offer broad opportunities to third parties to challenge issued patents. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, the USPTO and foreign governmental bodies and tribunals, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held in 2013 that certain claims to DNA molecules are not patentable and lower courts have since been applying this case in the context of other types of biological subject matter. We cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress, the USPTO or foreign governmental bodies or tribunals may impact the value of our patent rights.\nWe have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nWe have limited intellectual property rights outside the United States. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws and legal processes of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patents to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patents but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly China and certain other developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property, particularly those relating to pharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put any of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Furthermore, generic drug manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of any of our current or future patents, requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. Certain countries in Europe and developing countries, including China and India, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if any of our patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, and academic or research institutions. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nRisks Related to U.S. Government Contracts and Grants\nIf we are unable to generate revenues from partnerships, government funding or other sources of funding, we may be forced to suspend or terminate one or more of our Cloudbreak programs.\nIn order to continue our Cloudbreak programs, we will need to seek funding from partnerships, the government or other sources of funding. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain funding from partnerships, or enter into new contracts with the United States government or obtain other sources of funding to support any program resulting from our Cloudbreak platform. The process of completing a partnership or obtaining government contracts is lengthy and uncertain and we will have to compete with other companies and institutions in each instance. Further, with respect to government contracting, changes in government budgets and agendas may result in a decreased and de-prioritized emphasis on supporting the discovery and development of anti-infective products. If we cannot obtain or maintain government or other funding for our Cloudbreak programs, we may be forced to discontinue those programs.\nOur use of government funding adds uncertainty to our research and commercialization efforts and may impose requirements that increase our costs.\nContracts funded by the U.S. government and its agencies include provisions that reflect the government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n\u2022\nterminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason;\n\u2022\nreduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party;\n\u2022\nclaim rights, including intellectual property rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n\u2022\naudit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u2022\nsuspend the contractor from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nimpose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar the contractor from doing future business with the government;\n\u2022\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of products; and\n\u2022\npursue criminal or civil remedies under the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the federal civil False Claims Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements.\nIn addition, government contracts contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\n\u2022\nspecialized accounting systems unique to government contracts;\n\u2022\nmandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u2022\npublic disclosures of certain contract information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n\u2022\nmandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, anti-human-trafficking, non-discrimination, and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with these requirements, we may be subject to potential liability and to termination of our contracts.\nChanges in funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including beginning on December 22, 2018 and ending on January 25, 2019, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory authorities, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If repeated or prolonged government shutdowns occur, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nOur business is subject to audit by the U.S. government and a negative audit could adversely affect our business.\nUnited States government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors and recipients of Federal grants. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards.\nGovernment agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded.\nIf an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including:\n\u2022\ntermination of contracts;\n\u2022\nforfeiture of profits;\n\u2022\nsuspension of payments;\n\u2022\nfines; and\n\u2022\nsuspension or prohibition from conducting business with the United States government.\nIn addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, which could cause our stock price to decrease.\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nLaws and regulations affecting government contracts make it more expensive and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business.\nWe must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of government contracts, which can make it more difficult for us to retain our rights under our government grant contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with government agencies. Among the most significant government contracting regulations that affect our business are:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Acquisition Regulations, or FAR, and agency-specific regulations supplemental to the FAR, which comprehensively regulate the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;\n\u2022\nbusiness ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and include other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nexport and import control laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.\nAny changes in applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to obtain new contracts, which could limit our ability to conduct our business and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our senior management team and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent upon our senior management team, as well as the other principal members of our research and development teams. All of our executive officers are employed \u201cat will,\u201d meaning we or they may terminate the employment relationship at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing, regulatory, quality assurance and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisers, including scientific, regulatory, quality assurance and clinical advisers, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisers may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nWe expect to expand our operations, and may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our business.\nWe expect to expand the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, manufacturing, clinical, regulatory affairs, quality assurance and sales and marketing. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. We may not be able to effectively manage the expected expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Moreover, the expected expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nWe may engage in acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders or reduce our financial resources.\nIn the future, we may enter into transactions to acquire other businesses, products or technologies and our ability to do so successfully is unproven. If we do identify suitable candidates, we may not be able to make such acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all. Any acquisitions we make may fail to strengthen our competitive position and these transactions may be viewed negatively by customers or investors. We may decide to incur debt in connection with an acquisition or issue our common stock or other equity securities to the stockholders of the acquired company, which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. We could incur losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of the\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nacquired business that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel, technologies and operations into our existing business in an effective, timely and non-disruptive manner. Acquisitions may also divert management attention from day-to-day responsibilities, increase our expenses and reduce our cash available for operations and other uses. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report, these factors include:\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nthe commencement, timing, enrollment or results of the current and planned clinical trials of our product candidates or any future clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nany delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority\u2019s review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA\u2019s issuance of a \u201crefusal to file\u201d letter, \"complete response\" letter, or a request for additional information;\n\u2022\nadverse results, suspensions, terminations or delays in pre-clinical or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial, or to terminate an existing clinical trial or development program;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including but not limited to requirements for approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems or limitations on the ability of hospitals and outpatient treatment centers to receive adequate reimbursement for the purchase and use of our products;\n\u2022\nadverse developments concerning our contract manufacturers;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices or acceptable quality;\n\u2022\nour inability to establish collaborations, if needed;\n\u2022\nour failure to commercialize our product candidates successfully, or at all;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products or services offered by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, government grants or contracts or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022\nthe size and growth of our fungal infection, bacterial infection or other target markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully enter new markets or develop additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nour cash position and our ability to raise additional capital and the manner and terms on which we raise it, and the expectation of future fundraising activities by us;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public;\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\n\u2022\npublication of research reports or other media coverage about us or our industry or our therapeutic approaches in particular or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future or the expectation of such sales;\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting practices;\n\u2022\nineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patent rights, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Global Market, pharmaceutical companies and companies in the anti-infective sector in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that may or may not have been related or proportionate to the operating performance of these companies or their product potential. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. You may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders and their affiliates currently beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding voting stock. These stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company through 2020, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) December 31, 2020, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which requires the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates to exceed $700 million as of the prior June 30th and (d) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\naccounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, changes in rules of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require, among other things, that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and The Nasdaq Global Market to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and proxy access. Recent legislation permits emerging growth companies to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years from the pricing of our IPO. We intend to take advantage of this legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the political environment and the level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nWe expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies to continue to result in substantial legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These costs could decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, these rules and regulations could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. We had 33,838,466 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2019. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nSales of our common stock by current stockholders may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate and may make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock. In addition, shares of common stock that are either issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nCertain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe believe, based on our current business plan, that our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our obligations for the twelve months following the filing of this report. Significant additional capital will be needed to\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\ncontinue our operations as currently planned, including conducting clinical trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities and costs associated with operating as a public company. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to our existing stockholders and our existing stockholders may be materially diluted by such subsequent sales.\nPursuant to our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 EIP, our management is authorized to grant stock options to our employees, directors and consultants. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 EIP will automatically increase on January 1 of each year through and including January 1, 2025, by 4% of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year or a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors. Additionally, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP, will automatically increase on January 1 of each year through and including January 1, 2025, by the lesser of 1% of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year or 490,336 shares. Unless our board of directors elects not to increase the number of shares available for future grant each year under the 2015 EIP and the ESPP, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of working capital and may not use it effectively.\nOur management will have broad discretion in the application of our working capital. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of our working capital, its ultimate use may vary substantially from its currently intended use. Our management might not apply our working capital in ways that ultimately increase the value of your investment. We expect to use our working capital to fund research and development activities and general operating expenses. The failure by our management to apply this working capital effectively could harm our business. Pending its use, we may invest our working capital in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders. If we do not invest or apply our working capital in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which could limit the market price of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions include:\n\u2022\na board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent, which requires that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or by a majority of the total number of authorized directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\na requirement that no member of our board of directors may be removed from office by our stockholders except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by law, upon the approval of not less than two-thirds of all outstanding shares of our voting stock then entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u2022\na requirement of approval of not less than two-thirds of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend any bylaws by stockholder action or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock on terms determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval and which preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors and could also delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing or\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\ncause us to take other corporate actions you desire. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. As a result of capital raising and other transactions that have occurred since our inception in 2012, we may or may not have experienced an \u201cownership change.\u201d We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As of December 31, 2019, we had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $214.6 million, which begin to expire in 2033, which could be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and we may incur substantial costs to attempt to recover or reproduce the data. If any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and/or the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters, power loss, terrorist activity, public health crisis, pandemic diseases and other events beyond our control, the occurrence of which could materially harm our business.\nBusinesses located in California have, in the past, been subject to electrical blackouts as a result of a shortage of available electrical power and any future blackouts could disrupt our operations. We are also vulnerable to a major earthquake, wildfire, inclement weather and other natural and man-made disasters and public health crisis and pandemic diseases, such as coronavirus, and we have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business as a result of any such natural disaster, public health crisis or pandemic diseases and do not have an applicable recovery plan in place. In addition, if any of our third-party contract manufacturers are affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, power shortages or outages, floods, wildfire, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics,\nCIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nterrorism or other events outside of our control, our business and operating results could suffer. For example, in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. At this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our business and operating results is uncertain. We carry only limited business interruption insurance that would compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us in excess of insured amounts could cause our business to materially suffer.", "PERMNO": 15286, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CDTX"}
