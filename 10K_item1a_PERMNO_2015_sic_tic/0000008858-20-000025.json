{"cik": "8858", "company": "AVNET INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nForward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors\nThis Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Avnet. These statements are generally identified by words like \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cestimates\u201d or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, and actual results and other outcomes could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which that statement is made. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made.\nRisks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include the risk factors discussed below, but may also include risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that management does not currently consider material. Such factors make the Company\u2019s operating results for future periods difficult to predict and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the below factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results, prospects and liquidity. Similarly, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions; actual financial results that do not meet the Company\u2019s or the investment community\u2019s expectations; changes in the Company\u2019s or the investment community\u2019s expectations for the Company\u2019s future results, dividends or share repurchases; and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, impacted the operations of the Company and its business partners and negatively impacted the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, constrained workforce participation due to travel restrictions and quarantine orders, disrupted logistics and distribution systems, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As a result, this pandemic has negatively impacted the operations of the Company and its customers and suppliers, and resulted in or heightened the risks of customer bankruptcies, customer delayed or defaulted payments, acceleration of TI\u2019s planned withdrawal as a supplier, restrictions on access to financial markets and other risk factors described in the Company\u2019s Annual Report. While the Company has not yet experienced any material disruption to its upstream supply chain and many of its distribution centers remain operational under business continuity plans, it has experienced increased logistics costs, softer product demand, price constraints, longer lead times in certain regions, reduction in global distribution center utilization, and shipping delays. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, the Company has implemented business continuity plans, with a focus on employee safety and mitigation of business disruptions. The Company is also taking steps to conserve cash and\neffectively manage its debt. As the scope and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown and the extent of its economic impact continues to evolve globally, there is significant uncertainty related to the ultimate impact that it will have on the Company\u2019s business, its employees, results of operations and financial condition, and to what extent the Company\u2019s actions to mitigate such impacts will be successful and sufficient.\nEconomic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s financial results, operations and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions, the demand for its products and services, and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty, including the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d have in the past resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased sales, margins and earnings. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty may also lead the Company to impair assets, including goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, and increased restructuring expenses to reduce expenses in response to decreased sales or margins.\nThe Company may not be able to adequately adjust its cost structure in a timely fashion, which may adversely impact its profitability. Uncertainty about economic conditions may increase foreign currency volatility in markets in which the Company transacts business, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s results. Economic weakness and geopolitical uncertainty also make it more difficult for the Company to manage inventory levels and/or collect customer receivables, which may result in provisions to create reserves, write-offs, reduced access to liquidity and higher financing costs.\nThe Company is monitoring the implementation and effects of Brexit and developing contingency plans, including changes to its logistics operations and shipment routes and preparing for changes in trade facilitation regulations. While the extent of the impact of Brexit is not yet fully known, Brexit has led to instability and uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the European Union, could contribute to logistical and regulatory delays at borders and volatility in the foreign exchange markets and may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s trade operations and financial results.\nThe Company experiences significant competitive pressure, which may negatively impact its results.\nThe market for the Company\u2019s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances, new market entrants, non-traditional competitors, changes in industry standards and changes in customer needs and consumption models. Not only does the Company compete with other global distributors, it also competes for customers with regional distributors and some of the Company\u2019s own suppliers that maintain direct sales efforts. In addition, as the Company expands its offerings and geographies, the Company may encounter increased competition from current or new competitors. The Company\u2019s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.\nThe size of the Company\u2019s competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the Company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business. Therefore, some competitors may have greater resources or a more extensive customer or supplier base than the Company has in one or more of its market sectors and geographic areas, which may result in the Company not being able to effectively compete in certain markets which could impact the Company\u2019s profitability and prospects.\nChanges in customer needs and consumption models could significantly affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nChanges in customer needs and consumption models may cause a decline in the Company\u2019s billings, which would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. While the Company attempts to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible, the dynamics of the industries in which it operates make prediction of, and timely\nreaction to, such changes difficult.\nFuture downturns in the semiconductor and embedded solutions industries could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results and negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its current profitability levels. In addition, the semiconductor industry has historically experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in economic conditions, technology and manufacturing capacity. During fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, sales of semiconductors represented approximately 76%, 77%, and 78% of the Company's consolidated sales, respectively, and the Company\u2019s sales closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor industry.\nDue to the Company\u2019s increased online sales, system interruptions and delays that make its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond may reduce the attractiveness of its products and services to its customers. If the Company is unable to continually improve the efficiency of its systems, it could cause systems interruptions or delays and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nFailure to maintain or develop new relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales.\nOne of the Company\u2019s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the Company distributes. For fiscal 2020, there were no Company suppliers which accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s consolidated billings. The Company\u2019s contracts with its suppliers vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice. To the extent any primary suppliers terminate or significantly reduce their volume of business with the Company because of a product shortage, an unwillingness to do business with the Company, changes in strategy or otherwise, the Company\u2019s business and relationships with its customers could be negatively affected because its customers depend on the Company\u2019s distribution of technology hardware and software from the industry\u2019s leading suppliers. In addition, suppliers\u2019 strategy shifts or performance issues may negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial results. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company received notification from one of its largest suppliers Texas Instruments Incorporated (\u201cTI\u201d) that it planned to terminate the Company\u2019s distribution agreement by December 31, 2020 due to the evolution of its strategy. Sales from TI products represented approximately 9% and 10% of total sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively. If the impact of this termination is not offset over time by sales growth, gross margin improvements or operating cost reductions, the Company will experience lower sales and gross profits in the future.\nThe competitive landscape has also experienced a consolidation among suppliers, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability and customer base. Further, to the extent that any of the Company\u2019s key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including, without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or other terms that protect or enhance the Company\u2019s gross margins, it could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s non-U.S. locations represent a significant portion of its sales and, consequently, the Company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nDuring fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 approximately 75%, 75% and 76%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the Company\u2019s international operations, in particular those in emerging and developing economies, the Company\u2019s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf potential restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries;\n\u25cf foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations;\n\u25cf compliance with foreign and domestic data privacy regulations, business licensing requirements, environmental\nregulations and anti-corruption laws, the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines and criminal proceedings;\n\u25cf Compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations and adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including technology transfer restrictions, additional license, permit or authorization requirements for shipments, specific company sanctions, new and higher duties, tariffs or surcharges, or other import/export controls, unilaterally or bilaterally;\n\u25cf complex and changing tax laws and regulations;\n\u25cf regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions;\n\u25cf economic and political instability (including the uncertainty caused by Brexit), terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest;\n\u25cf fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure;\n\u25cf natural disasters, pandemics and other public health crises;\n\u25cf differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues; and\n\u25cf the risk of non-compliance with local laws.\nIn addition to the cost of compliance, the potential criminal penalties for violations of import or export regulations and anti-corruption laws by the Company or its third-party agents create heightened risks for the Company\u2019s international operations. In the event that a governing regulatory body determines that the Company has violated applicable import or export regulations or anti-corruption laws, the Company could be fined significant sums, incur sizable legal defense costs, have its import or export capabilities restricted or denied and/or have its inventories seized, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Additionally, allegations that the Company has violated a governmental regulation may negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation, which may result in customers or suppliers being unwilling to do business with the Company. While the Company has adopted measures and controls designed to ensure compliance with these laws, the Company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation.\nThe Company transacts sales, pays expenses, owns assets and incurs liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the Company must translate sales, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies affect the Company\u2019s reported amounts of sales, operating income, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect the Company\u2019s earnings from those markets. While the Company may use derivative financial instruments to further reduce its net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not materially affect the Company\u2019s financial results. Further, foreign currency instability and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of the Company\u2019s customers and may impair its customers\u2019 ability to repay existing obligations.\nThe U.S. government imposed new or higher tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S., and the Chinese government imposed new or higher tariffs on certain products imported into China. New trade policies, regulations, license requirements and restrictions affecting sales and shipments to specific China-based customers and of certain U.S. commodities and technologies to China have also been implemented. Additionally, several trade policies, rules and\nrestrictions applicable to China are now applicable to Hong Kong. These actions have resulted in increased costs, including increased costs of procuring certain products the Company purchases from its suppliers, and other related expenses. While the Company intends to reflect such increased costs in its selling prices, such price increases may impact the Company\u2019s sales and customer demand for certain products. In addition, increased operational expenses incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of its business units. Neither such U.S. tariffs nor any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have yet had a material impact, but there can be no assurance that future actions or escalations that affect trade relations will not occur or will not materially affect the Company\u2019s sales and results of operations. To the extent that Company sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf the Company\u2019s internal information systems fail to function properly, or if the Company is unsuccessful in the implementation, integration or upgrade of information systems, its business operations could suffer.\nThe Company is dependent on its information systems to facilitate the day-to-day operations of the business and to produce timely, accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results. Currently, the Company\u2019s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems, some of which are subject to ongoing IT projects designed to streamline or optimize the Company\u2019s global information systems. These IT projects are extremely complex, in part, because of a wide range of processes, the multiple legacy systems used and the Company\u2019s business operations. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful at all times in these efforts or that there will not be implementation or integration difficulties that will adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to complete business transactions and ensure accurate recording and reporting of financial data. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve the expected efficiencies and cost savings as a result of the IT projects, thus negatively impacting the Company\u2019s financial results. A failure of any of these information systems in a way described above or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, internal controls and reporting obligations under federal securities laws.\nMajor disruptions to the Company\u2019s logistics capability could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s global logistics services are operated through specialized, centralized or outsourced distribution centers around the globe. The Company also depends almost entirely on third-party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason (such as information technology upgrades and operating issues, warehouse modernization and relocation efforts, natural disasters, pandemics, or significant disruptions of services from the Company\u2019s third-party transportation providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business partners, and on the Company\u2019s business, operations and financial performance.\nIf the Company sustains cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, it could suffer a loss of sales and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other negative consequences.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology may be subject to cyber-attacks, security breaches or computer hacking. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the Company\u2019s security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack the Company\u2019s systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities, including ransomware that could encrypt the Company\u2019s files so an attacker may demand a ransom for restored access. The Company\u2019s systems and the data stored on those systems\nmay also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events that could negatively affect the Company\u2019s systems and its data, as well as the data of the Company\u2019s business partners. Further, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Company\u2019s data and information technology systems or to misdirect payments, otherwise known as phishing. Lastly, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to the Company, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. The Company\u2019s remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of the Company\u2019s security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about the Company, its business partners or other third parties could expose the Company to significant potential liability and reputational harm. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, the Company may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect its data and infrastructure, which may impact the Company\u2019s profitability. Although the Company has insurance coverage for protecting against cyber-attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims and the Company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business. As a global enterprise, the Company could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection.\nDeclines in the value of the Company\u2019s inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the Company\u2019s customers could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe electronic components and integrated products industries are subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced products, changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Regardless of the general economic environment, it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and, as a result of the price declines, there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value. Although it is the policy of many of the Company\u2019s suppliers to offer certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and limited rights of return), the Company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, some of which are not documented and, therefore, subject to the discretion of the supplier. In addition, the majority of the Company\u2019s sales are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, rather than through long-term sales contracts. Where there is a contract, such contract is generally terminable at will upon notice. The Company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments, declines in the value of the Company\u2019s inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nSubstantial defaults by the Company\u2019s customers or suppliers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s working capital consists of accounts receivable. If entities responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to cease doing business, direct their business elsewhere, become insolvent or unable to pay the amount they owe the Company, or were to become unwilling or unable to make such payments in a timely manner, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely affect the collectability of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management\u2019s expectations. A significant deterioration in the Company\u2019s ability to collect on accounts receivable in the\nUnited States could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program.\nThe Company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to satisfy its cash needs and implement its capital allocation strategy depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing. However, external financing is affected by various factors, including general market conditions as well as the Company\u2019s debt ratings and operating results, and may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. An increase in the Company\u2019s level of debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing financing and could result in a reduction of its credit limits, increased financing expenses and subject the Company to additional restrictions and covenants. A reduction in its current debt rating may also negatively impact the Company\u2019s working capital and impair its relationship with its customers and suppliers.\nAs of June 27, 2020, Avnet had debt outstanding under various notes, secured borrowings and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions. The Company needs cash to make interest payments on, and to repay, this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. Under certain of its credit facilities, the applicable interest rate and costs are based in part on the Company\u2019s current debt rating. If its debt rating is reduced, higher interest rates and increased costs would result. In addition, certain of its debt utilizes the LIBOR rate, which the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority has announced that it intends to phase out by the end of 2021. At this time, it is uncertain how markets will respond to the discontinuation of LIBOR or to the proposed alternative rates, and may result in increased costs and higher interest rates. Any material increase in the Company\u2019s financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective financing could have an adverse effect on its profitability, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnder certain of its credit facilities, the Company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and pass certain financial tests. If the Company increases its level of debt or experiences a deterioration of its operating results, it may fail to meet these financial ratios and/or pass these tests, which may result in an event of default, whereby lenders may accelerate payment and the Company may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities. If the Company is unable to utilize these facilities or is required to repay debt earlier than management expected, it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments, to repay indebtedness or for general corporate needs.\nGeneral economic or business conditions, domestic and foreign, may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers, which may impact access to the Company\u2019s accounts receivable securitization program.\nThe agreements governing some of the Company\u2019s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit management\u2019s discretion in operating the business and could prevent management from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the Company\u2019s business.\nThe agreements governing the Company\u2019s financing, including its credit facility, accounts receivable securitization program and the indentures governing the Company\u2019s outstanding notes, contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, limit the Company\u2019s ability, and the ability of certain subsidiaries, to:\n\u25cf grant liens on assets;\n\u25cf make restricted payments (including, under certain circumstances, paying dividends on common stock or redeeming or repurchasing common stock);\n\u25cf make certain investments;\n\u25cf merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets;\n\u25cf incur additional debt; or\n\u25cf engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, repurchase common stock, pay a dividend, compete effectively or make further investments.\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, changes in business performance or unfavorable assessments from tax audits could adversely affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rates, deferred taxes, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, regulations may be enacted that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s tax positions. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s cash flow, and in some cases the effective tax rate, will not be adversely affected by these potential changes in regulations or by changes in the interpretation of existing tax law and regulations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted tax legislation (the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d) which includes provisions to lower the corporate income tax rate, impose new taxes on certain foreign earnings, limit deductibility of certain U.S. costs and levy a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated offshore earnings, among others. The Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact the Company unfavorably.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows net operating losses incurred in fiscal 2019, 2020, and 2021 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable fiscal years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The CARES Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact the Company unfavorably.\nMany countries are adopting provisions to align their international tax rules with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy. These provisions, individually or as a whole, may negatively impact taxation of international business.\nThe tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the Company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the Company would be successful in defending against any such challenge.\nThe Company\u2019s future income tax expense could also be favorably or adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes to its operating structure.\nIf the Company fails to maintain effective internal controls, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely, or prevent or detect fraud, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business or the market price of the Company\u2019s securities.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports, safeguard its assets and to effectively prevent or detect fraud. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively safeguard its assets and prevent or detect fraudulent activity, its brand and operating results could be harmed. Internal controls over financial reporting are intended to prevent or detect material misstatements in its financial reporting or material fraudulent activity. Although such controls are inherently limited and may not identify all immaterial activity which could aggregate into a material misstatement, such limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and prevention of all fraud and loss of assets. Management continuously evaluates the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s internal controls. However, if the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved internal controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the Company\u2019s business and operating results could be harmed. Additionally, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, and the Company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, all of which could have an adverse effect on its business or the market price of the Company\u2019s securities.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAvnet has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or investments in companies around the world to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives. Acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties, some of which may differ from those associated with Avnet\u2019s historical operations. The risks relating to such acquisitions and investments include, but are not limited to, risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas, adding additional product lines and services, impacting existing customer and supplier relationships, incurring costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired, incurring potential impairment charges on acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and diverting management\u2019s attention from existing business operations. As a result, the Company\u2019s profitability may be negatively impacted. In addition, the Company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than anticipated. Further, any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will result in an increase in the expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition, thereby impacting the Company\u2019s profitability. The Company may experience disruptions that could, depending on the size of the acquisition, have an adverse effect on its business, especially where an acquisition target may have pre-existing compliance issues or pre-existing deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, the Company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company may become involved in legal proceedings that could cause it to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s efforts or require it to pay substantial damages or licensing fees.\nFrom time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings, including government investigations, that arise out of the ordinary conduct of the Company\u2019s business, including matters involving intellectual property rights, commercial matters, merger-related matters, product liability and other actions. The Company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the Company sells are alleged to infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. While the Company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, there is no assurance that it will be successful in realizing such indemnification or that the Company will be fully protected against such claims. However, the Company is exposed to potential liability for\ntechnology and products that it develops for which it has no indemnification protections. If an infringement claim against the Company is successful, the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or services, which could affect its ability to compete effectively. In addition, the Company\u2019s expanding business activities may include the assembly or manufacture of electronic component products and systems. Product defects, whether caused by a design, assembly, manufacture or component failure or error, or manufacturing processes not in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may result in product liability claims, product recalls, fines and penalties. Product liability risks could be particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of such products. Legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s efforts and other resources and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and business reputation.\nIn order to be successful, the Company must attract, retain, train, motivate and develop key employees, and failure to do so could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results and strategic initiatives.\nIdentifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified employees are critical to the Company\u2019s future, and competition for experienced employees in the Company\u2019s industry can be intense. Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws, including related to visa restrictions, may limit the Company\u2019s acquisition of talent in key business areas. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the Company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, and as the Company expands its offerings, realignment, training and hiring of skilled personnel may not be sufficiently rapid. From time to time the Company has effected restructurings, which eliminate a number of positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and the Company\u2019s ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future. If the Company loses existing qualified personnel or is unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nFailure to comply with the requirements of environmental regulations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters. While the Company strives to ensure it is in full compliance with all applicable regulations, certain of these regulations impose liability without fault. Additionally, the Company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. Further, environmental laws may become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations.", "PERMNO": 27684, "SIC": 5065, "TIC": "AVT"}
