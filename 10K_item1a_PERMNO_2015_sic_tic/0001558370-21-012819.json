Risk Factors\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business faces significant risks and uncertainties of which investors should be aware before making a decision to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The following is a summary of the more significant risks relating to the Company. A more detailed description of our risk factors is set forth below under the caption \u201cDetails Risk Factors.\u201d\nRisks Related to COVID-19\n\u2022 We may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\n\u2022 We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant losses.\n\u2022 We anticipate that our expenses will increase in the future.\n\u2022 We need additional funding to fully execute our business plan, which funding may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.\n\u2022 Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders and/or restrict our operations or rights.\n\u2022 We have a limited operations as a CDMO and biopharmaceutical.\n\u2022 Potential use of government funding for our R&D programs may impose requirements that limit our ability to take certain actions\n\u2022 We may not have an adequate number of shares of common stock authorized to enable us to complete future equity financing transactions or strategic transactions, which may adversely affect our ability to grow and develop and may require us to rely on debt to fund our business plans.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Technologies and Product Candidates\n\u2022 We currently have only four product candidates in early stages of pre-clinical development and are dependent on the success of these product candidates, which requires significant clinical testing before seeking regulatory approval.\n\u2022 Our business could be significantly impacted if the products we manufacture do not gain market acceptance.\n\u2022 There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and commercialize product candidates.\n\u2022 We may not be successful in our efforts to use iBio technologies to build a pipeline of product candidates.\n\u2022 We or our clients, collaborators or licensees are dependent upon successful preclinical and clinical studies.\n\u2022 If we, or our clients and collaborators, are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we, or our clients and collaborators, will not be able to commercialize our, or third-party, product candidates.\n\u2022 Alternative technologies may supersede our technologies or make them noncompetitive.\n\u2022 Our clinical product candidate may exhibit undesirable side effects, which may delay or preclude its development or regulatory approval, or limits use if ever approved.\n\u2022 Our failure to receive or maintain regulatory approval for product candidates developed at our facility could negatively impact our revenue and profitability.\n\u2022 Product liability lawsuits could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit product commercialization.\n\u2022 Any manufacturing problems at our facility could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of our clinical product.\nRisks Related to Dependence on Third Parties\n\u2022 If we are unable to establish new collaborations and maintain both new and existing collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u2022 If third parties on whom we or our licensees will rely for the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies do not perform as required, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\n\u2022 If revenue is concentrated on a few clients, we may be adversely impacted by the dependence upon those clients.\n\u2022 Our inability to obtain such raw materials or supplies may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\u2022 Any claims beyond our insurance coverage limits may result in substantial costs.\n\u2022 We may be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\u2022 If we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\n\u2022 We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful.\n\u2022 Failure to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties could result in a loss or intellectual property rights.\n\u2022 Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position for an adequate amount of time.\n\u2022 If we are unable to protect our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\n\u2022 We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patent filings and other intellectual property.\n\u2022 Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\n\u2022 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\n\u2022 If we should fail to comply with various patents laws, our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated.\n\u2022 Changes in patent law could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nRisks Related to iBio\u2019s Operations\n\u2022 Our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to maximize our facility capacity utilization.\n\u2022 A failure by iBio to hire and retain an appropriately skilled and adequate workforce could adversely impact the ability of the facility to operate and function efficiently.\n\u2022 If we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings, our business and results of operations could suffer.\n\u2022 Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\u2022 If we are unable to provide quality and timely services to our customers, our business could suffer\n\u2022 We may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\n\u2022 If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our customers\u2019 proprietary information, we may be subject to claims.\n\u2022 We rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to operate our CDMO business and our research and development activities and do not have any long-term commitments from such suppliers.\n\u2022 If we acquire companies, products or technologies, we may face integration risks and costs associated with those acquisitions that could negatively impact our business, results from operations and financial condition.\n\u2022 We depend on key personnel and the loss of key personnel could harm our business and results of operations.\n\u2022 We rely extensively on our information technology systems and are vulnerable to damage and interruption.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\n\u2022 We are subject to compliance under the NYSE American continued listing standards of the NYSE American Company Guide, the failure of which can result in our delisting from the NYSE American.\n\u2022 Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\n\u2022 We do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022 The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of the holders of shares of our common stock.\n\u2022 The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\n\u2022 Reports published by securities or industry analysts, could adversely affect our common stock price and trading volume.\n\u2022 We are subject to reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies.\n\u2022 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nDetailed Risk Factors:\nOur business faces many risks. Past experience may not be indicative of future performance, and as noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have included forward-looking statements about our business, plans and prospects that are subject to change. Forward-looking statements are particularly located in, but not limited to, the sections \u201cBusiness\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d In addition to the other risks or uncertainties contained in this Annual Report, the risks described below may affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. If any of these risks occur, either alone or in combination with other factors, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock may decline. Moreover, readers should note this is not an exhaustive list of the risks we face; some risks are unknown or not quantifiable, and other risks that we currently perceive as immaterial may ultimately prove more significant than expected. Statements about plans, predictions or expectations should not be construed to be assurances of performance or promises to take a given course of action.\nCOVID-19\nWe may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of the pandemic, we have at times experienced reduced capacity to provide CDMO services as a result of instituting social distancing at work requirements in our Texas facility, restricting access to essential workers, as well as taking other precautions. We also experienced a full three-day operational shutdown in April 2020 for extensive facility cleaning following the discovery that an employee had contracted COVID-19, and successfully resumed operations on a reduced capacity basis. In addition, in order to avoid shortages of raw materials and other supplies experienced by other manufacturers we have increased our inventory of such materials; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid supply chain shortages in the future. Although, to date our operations have not been materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and we do not currently anticipate operational difficulties due to the pandemic, the risk exists that further COVID-19 developments may negatively impact our operations if we should suffer supply chain shortages, absenteeism of workers or facility shutdowns due to the pandemic. Governmental restrictions, including travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business closures, new safety requirements or regulations, or restrictions on the import or export of certain materials, or other operational issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The evolving nature of the circumstances is such that it is impossible, at this stage, to determine the full and overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have, but it could further disrupt production and cause delays in the supply and delivery of products used in our operations, adversely affect our employees and disrupt our operations and manufacturing activities, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We have ascertained that certain risks associated with further COVID-19 developments may adversely impact our operations and liquidity, and our business and share price may also be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we do not anticipate any significant threat to our operations at this point in time. Due to the general unknown nature surrounding the crisis, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential for any future impacts on our operations or liquidity.\nIn addition, we are developing vaccine for COVID. There is no assurance that our activities relating to the development of intellectual property in the field of vaccine candidate development for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, will result in the development of any successful product candidates or generate any proceeds or that we will be able to develop a vaccine in time for its use. These efforts are subject to the risks relating to the development and commercialization of our technologies and product candidates, risks relating to our intellectual property and other risks relating to our operations described in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses during our next fiscal year and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince our 2008 spinoff from Integrated BioPharma, we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. Our net loss attributable to iBio Inc. was approximately $23.2 million and $16.4 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $173.6 million.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of common stock, preferred stock and warrants. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including the development and validation of our technologies, our CDMO facilities, and the development of a proprietary therapeutic product against fibrosis and COVID-19 vaccines based upon our technologies. We have not completed development of or commercialized any vaccine or therapeutic product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and may incur operating losses for at least the next year. We anticipate that our expenses and losses will increase substantially if we:\n\u25cf initiate clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u25cf continue the research and development of our product candidates;\n\u25cf seek to discover or license in additional product candidates; and\n\u25cf add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and manufacturing efforts.\nOur profitability in large part depends on our four research and development programs and our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates and to a lesser extent, our ability to generate revenue from our iBio CDMO services. This will require us, alone or with our licensees and collaborators, to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which regulatory approval is obtained or establishing collaborations with parties willing and able to provide necessary capital or other value. We may never succeed in these activities. We may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would diminish the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will increase in the future.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly as our product candidates advance in clinical development, and as we add more employees. As part of the regulatory process, we must conduct clinical trials for each product candidate to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The number and design of the clinical trials that will be required varies depending upon product candidate, the condition being evaluated and the trial results themselves. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the clinical trials. Clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. We estimate that clinical trials of our product candidates will take at least several years to complete. Because of numerous risks and uncertainties involved in our business, the timing or amount of increased development expenses cannot be accurately predicted, and our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, to perform studies or clinical trials in addition to those we currently anticipate. We anticipate that further product development is also expected to increase expenses, including but not limited to the expected initiation of IND-enabling studies of IBIO-100 and IBIO-101 in fiscal 2022 and the additional studies that will be required to support development of IBIO-400 for which we recently submitted an Outline of Production and facility documentation to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials.\nIn addition, as we expand our business, we will need to retain additional employees with the necessary skills including employees for our planned establishment of drug discovery capabilities in San Diego, California. In addition, to achieve our objectives we expect to add additional employees which is expected to significantly add to our fixed costs.\nEven if any of our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with the commercial launch of and the related commercial-scale manufacturing requirements for our product candidates. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of future expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. These losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our financial position and working capital.\nWe need additional funding to fully execute our business plan, which funding may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate the commercialization of our development and manufacturing services and efforts for our product development programs.\nWe will need additional capital to fully implement our current long-term business, operating and development plans. To the extent that we initiate or continue clinical development without securing collaborator or licensee funding, our research and development expenses could increase substantially.\nWhen we elect to raise additional funds or additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives. Additional equity or debt financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. We currently have no committed sources of funding. On November 25, 2020, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (the \u201cSales Agreement\u201d) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (\"Cantor Fitzgerald\") to sell shares of common stock, from time to time, through an \u201cat the market offering\u201d program having an aggregate offering price of up to $100,000,000 through which Cantor Fitzgerald would act as sales agent (the \u201cSales Agent\u201d). There can be no assurance that we will meet the requirements to be able to sell securities pursuant to the Sales Agreement, of if we meet the requirements that we will be able to raise sufficient funds on favorable terms. If we are unable to raise capital in sufficient amounts when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts and our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability will be substantially harmed.\nGiven that our total cash and investments in debt securities as of June 30, 2021 was approximately $97.0 million, we believe we have adequate cash to support our current operations. We plan to fund our future business operations using cash on hand, through proceeds realized in connection with the commercialization of our technologies and proprietary products (which is not anticipated to be generated, if ever, in the near future), license and collaboration arrangements and the operation of iBio CDMO, and through proceeds from the sale of additional equity or other securities. We cannot be certain that such funding will be available on favorable terms or available at all. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution.\nWe have based this projection on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, in which case we may deplete our cash resources sooner than we currently anticipate. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf our ability to further obtain and retain developmental, manufacturing and facility build-out and technology transfer opportunities at iBio CDMO;\n\u25cf the ability to generate and increase third-party client sales and realized revenue at iBio CDMO;\n\u25cf our ability to attract additional licensees or other third parties willing to fund development and, if successful, commercialization of product candidates;\n\u25cf the costs, timing and regulatory review of our own product candidates and preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u25cf the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and\n\u25cf the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies.\nIf we are unable to raise funds when required or on favorable terms, this assumption may no longer be operative, and we may have to: a) significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the product application and/or commercialization of our proprietary technologies; b) seek collaborators for our technology and product candidates on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; c) relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates, or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize; or d) possibly cease operations.\nWe may not have an adequate number of shares of common stock authorized to enable us to complete future equity financing transactions or strategic transactions, which may adversely affect our ability to grow and develop.\nWe are authorized to issue 275,000,000 shares of common stock, of which approximately 217,873,094 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding as June 30, 2021. At June 30, 2021, 35.3 million common shares were reserved for issuance of shares upon exercise of outstanding options or reserved for future issuance of common shares under our equity incentive plans. If all of these securities were exercised it would leave 21.8 million authorized but unissued shares of common stock.\nAs a result of our limited number of our authorized and unissued shares of common stock, we may have insufficient shares of common stock available to issue in connection with any future equity financing transactions or strategic transactions we may seek to undertake. Accordingly, we will likely take steps in the near future to increase our number of available shares, which may include seeking stockholder approval of an increase in our authorized number of shares of common stock or a reverse stock split. At our annual meeting of stockholders held on December 9, 2020, we sought but did not obtain approval of an increase in our authorized number of shares of common stock from 275,000,000 to 425,000,000. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in seeking approval for such actions. If not, we may need to rely on debt for growth capital or take other steps necessary to raise capital or reduce operations.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time as we can generate substantial development, manufacturing, license or product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, collaborations, strategic alliances, service contracts, manufacturing contracts, facility build-out and technology transfer contracts, licensing and other arrangements. Sources of funds may not be available or, if available, may not be available on terms satisfactory to us.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue our operations.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through a public or private offering and sale of equity securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. We are authorized to issue 275,000,000 shares of common stock, of which at June 30, 2021, approximately 217,873,094 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding and 35,330,000 common shares were reserved for issuance of shares upon exercise of outstanding options or reserved for future issuance of common shares under our equity incentive plans. If all of these securities were exercised it would leave 21.8 million authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Accordingly, we will be able to issue up to approximately 21.8 million additional shares of common stock and 999,999 shares of preferred stock based on our current authorized number of shares\nof common stock. Sales of our common stock offered through current or future equity offerings may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to investors, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nWe have a limited operating history conducting commercial activities as a CDMO and developing vaccines and therapeutics, which may limit the ability of investors to make an informed investment decision.\nWe commenced independent operations in 2008, and our operations to date have included organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing our proprietary technologies, recommissioning and operating our CDMO facility, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking, through third parties, preclinical trials and clinical trials of product candidates derived from our technologies. Commercial activities at our CDMO facility commenced in January 2016 with the large majority of our early efforts directed towards recommissioning the facility to help meet cGMP manufacturing standards and provisions for iBio\u2019s core service offerings. During the past year, we shifted our focus away from generating revenue as a CDMO service provider to the development of vaccines and therapeutics for commercialization. The current vaccines and therapeutics being developed are all in preclinical development. Certain vaccine candidates using iBio\u2019s technologies have previously been evaluated by other organizations in Phase 1 clinical trials; however, all of our vaccine and therapeutic protein product candidates are still in preclinical development. Neither we nor our collaborators have completed any other clinical trials for any vaccine or therapeutic protein product candidate produced using iBio technology. As a result, we have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete any Phase 2 or pivotal clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any conclusion you reach about our future success or viability may not be as predictive as it might be if we had a longer operating history.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for the sale of any of our product candidates, we do not know when we will begin to generate significant revenue from such product candidates, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf set an acceptable price for our products and obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors;\n\u25cf establish sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution systems; add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical, manufacturing and planned future clinical development and commercialization efforts and operations as a public company;\n\u25cf manufacture commercial quantities of product candidates at acceptable cost levels;\n\u25cf achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidates in the medical community and with third-party payors and consumers;\n\u25cf attract and retain an experienced management and advisory team;\n\u25cf launch commercial sales of our products, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and\n\u25cf maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with development and manufacturing, we are unable to predict if we will generate significant revenue. If we cannot successfully execute on any of the factors listed above, our business may not succeed, and we may never generate significant revenue.\nAny government funding for our R&D programs may impose requirements that limit our ability to take certain actions, and subject us to potential financial penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have applied for government grants to support some of our research and development activities for our product candidates. Often government grants include provisions that reflect the government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to potentially require repayment of all or a portion of the grant award proceeds, in certain cases with interest, in the event we violate certain covenants pertaining to various matters.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Technologies and Product Candidates\nWe currently have only four product candidates in early stages of pre-clinical development and are dependent on the success of these product candidates, which requires significant clinical testing before seeking regulatory approval. If our product candidates do not receive regulatory approval or are not successfully commercialized, our business may be harmed.\nWe are currently in preclinical development of seven product candidates as potential treatments for fibrosis, oncology, COVID-19 and a veterinary vaccine for swine fever. It is possible that we may never be able to develop a marketable product candidate.\nWe expect that a substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures over the next few years will be devoted to these product candidates. Accordingly, our business currently depends heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of these product candidates, which may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if regulatory approval is received. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of product candidates are and will remain subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries that each have differing regulations. We are not permitted to market any product in the United States unless and until we receive approval from the FDA, or in any foreign countries unless and until we receive the requisite approval from regulatory authorities in such countries. We have never submitted an NDA or BLA to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities and do not expect to be in a position to do so for the foreseeable future. Obtaining approval of an NDA or BLA is an extensive, lengthy, expensive, and inherently uncertain process, and the FDA may delay, limit or deny approval of its product for many reasons.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, our focus is limited to the development of our four product candidates. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other technologies or product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending and the spending of our clients and collaborators may not yield any commercially viable products.\nWe have based our research and development efforts largely on our technologies and product candidates derived from such technologies. Notwithstanding our large investment to date and anticipated future expenditures in these technologies, we have not yet developed, and may never successfully develop, any marketed products using these technologies. As a result, we may fail to address or develop product candidates based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe also may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates using our technologies. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be significantly impacted if the products we manufacture for our customers do not gain market acceptance.\nIf the products we manufacture for our customers do not gain market acceptance or production volumes of key products that we manufacture for our customers decline, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. We depend on, and have no control over, market acceptance for the products we manufacture for our customers. Consumer demand for our customers\u2019 products could be adversely affected by, among other things, delays in securing regulatory approvals, the emergence of competing or alternative products, including generic drugs, the loss of patent and other intellectual property rights protection, reductions in private and government payment product subsidies or changing product marketing strategies.\nWe expect that continued changes to the healthcare industry, including ongoing healthcare reform, changes in government or private funding of healthcare products and services, legislation or regulations governing the delivery, pricing or reimbursement of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, could cause healthcare industry participants to purchase fewer services from us or influence the price that others are willing to pay for our services. Changes in the healthcare industry\u2019s pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could also significantly reduce our revenue and profitability.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular technology or product candidate and fail to capitalize on technologies or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific product candidates derived from or enhanced by our technologies or that have been identified and partially developed by our clients or collaborators. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other technologies or product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending and the spending of our clients and collaborators may not yield any commercially viable products.\nWe have based our research and development efforts largely on our technologies and product candidates derived from such technologies. Notwithstanding our large investment to date and anticipated future expenditures in these technologies, we have not yet developed, and may never successfully develop, any marketed products using these technologies. As a result, we may fail to address or develop product candidates based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe also may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates using our technologies. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements on terms less favorable to us than possible.\nWe, our clients and collaborators, are very early in our development efforts. If we or our clients and collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nExcepting a limited number of vaccine candidates that have been evaluated in completed Phase 1 clinical trials, all of our other vaccine and therapeutic protein product candidates are still in preclinical development. Our ability to generate product sales revenues for our own products, which we do not expect will occur for many years, will depend heavily on\nthe successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. The success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u25cf completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials with positive results;\n\u25cf receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, which may exceed patent exclusivity, for our product candidates;\n\u25cf making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for commercial manufacturing capabilities;\n\u25cf launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u25cf successfully maintaining existing collaborations and entering into new ones throughout the development process as appropriate, from preclinical studies through to commercialization;\n\u25cf acceptance of the products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u25cf effectively competing with other products;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government payors, for any products we successfully develop;\n\u25cf protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u25cf maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the products following approval.\nIf we or our collaborators do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use iBio technologies to build a pipeline of product candidates and develop marketable products.\nWhile we believe that data we and our collaborators have obtained from preclinical studies and Phase I clinical trials of iBio technology-derived and iBio technology-enhanced product candidates has validated these technologies, our technologies have not yet, and may never lead to, approvable or marketable products. Even if we are successful in further validating our technologies and continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development for many possible reasons, including harmful side effects, limited efficacy or other characteristics that indicate that such product candidates are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we and our collaborators do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon our technologies, we will not obtain product or collaboration revenues in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price.\nNeither we nor our clients, collaborators or licensees will be able to commercialize product candidates based on our technologies and services if preclinical studies do not produce successful results or clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans.\nPreclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and has an uncertain outcome. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. We and our licensees may\nexperience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent the commercialization of product candidates based on our iBio technologies, including the following:\n\u25cf Preclinical or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, which may require additional preclinical testing, additional clinical trials or the abandonment of projects that we expect to be promising. For example, promising animal data may be obtained about the anticipated efficacy of a therapeutic protein product candidate and then human tests may not result in such an effect. In addition, unexpected safety concerns may be encountered that would require further testing even if the therapeutic protein product candidate produced an otherwise favorable response in human subjects.\n\u25cf Initial clinical results may not be supported by further or more extensive clinical trials. For example, a licensee may obtain data that suggest a desirable immune response from a vaccine candidate in a small human study, but when tests are conducted on larger numbers of people, the same extent of immune response may not occur. If the immune response generated by a vaccine is too low or occurs in too few treated individuals, then the vaccine will have no commercial value.\n\u25cf Enrollment in our or our licensee\u2019s clinical trials may be slower than projected, resulting in significant delays. The cost of conducting a clinical trial increases as the time required to enroll adequate numbers of human subjects to obtain meaningful results increases. Enrollment in a clinical trial can be a slower-than-anticipated process because of competition from other clinical trials, because the study is not of interest to qualified subjects, or because the stringency of requirements for enrollment limits the number of people who are eligible to participate in the clinical trial.\n\u25cf We or our licensees might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participating subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. Animal tests do not always adequately predict potential safety risks to human subjects. The risk of any candidate product is unknown until it is tested in human subjects, and if subjects experience adverse events during the clinical trial, the trial may have to be suspended and modified or terminated entirely.\n\u25cf Regulators or institutional review boards may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including safety concerns or noncompliance with regulatory requirements.\n\u25cf Any regulatory approval ultimately obtained may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the product not commercially viable.\n\u25cf The effects of iBio technology-derived or iBio technology-enhanced product candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects.\nSignificant clinical trial delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we or our licensees do and impair our ability to commercialize our technologies and product candidates based on our technologies. Poor clinical trial results or delays may make it impossible to license a product candidate, or reduce its attractiveness to prospective licensees, so that we will be unable to successfully develop and commercialize such a product candidate.\nClinical trials are risky, lengthy, and expensive. We will incur substantial expense for, and devote significant time and resources to, preclinical testing and clinical trials, yet we cannot be certain that these tests and trials will demonstrate that a product candidate is effective and well-tolerated or will ever support its approval and commercial sale. For example, clinical trials require adequate supplies of clinical trial material and sufficient patient enrollment to power the trial. Delays in patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times. Even if we, or a licensee or collaborator, if applicable, successfully complete clinical trials for our clinical product candidate, we or they might not file the required regulatory submissions in a timely manner and may not receive marketing approval for the clinical product candidate. We cannot assure you that our clinical product candidate will successfully progress further through the drug development process or will ultimately result in an approved and commercially viable product.\nIf we, or our clients and collaborators, are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we, or our clients and collaborators, will not be able to develop or commercialize our, or third-party, product candidates or will not be able to do so as soon as anticipated, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and by similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third parties to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use in such a restrictive manner that it is not possible to obtain commercial viability for such product.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years. If additional clinical trials are required for certain jurisdictions, these trials can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review process for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the review and approval of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept a marketing application as deficient or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nAlthough the FDA and other regulatory authorities have approved plant-based therapeutics in the past, consistent with the oversight of all products, the FDA is monitoring whether these plant-based therapeutics pose any health and human safety risks. While they have not issued any regulation to date that is averse to plant-based vaccines or therapeutics, it is possible that the FDA and other regulatory authorities could issue regulations in the future that could adversely affect our product candidates.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, recordkeeping, export, import, advertising and promotional activities for such product candidate, among other things, will be subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety, efficacy and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment registration and drug listing requirements, continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping and current GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product candidate may be marketed or to the conditions of approval. If our clinical product candidate receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our product, which could limit sales.\nAlternative technologies may supersede our technologies or make them noncompetitive, which would harm our ability to generate future revenue.\nThe manufacture of biologics and the methods of such manufacture are intensely competitive fields. Each of these fields is characterized by extensive research efforts, which result in rapid technological progress that can render existing technologies obsolete or economically noncompetitive. If our competitors succeed in developing more effective technologies or render our technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, our business will suffer. Many universities, public agencies and established pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences companies with substantially greater resources than we have are developing and using technologies and are actively engaging in the development of products similar to or competitive with our technologies and products. To remain competitive, we must continue to invest in new technologies and improve existing technologies. To make such renewing investment we will need to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to secure such financing, we will not have sufficient resources to continue such investment. In addition, they also have significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of products, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those products in the United States and in foreign countries. Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors.\nOur competitors may devise methods and processes for protein expression that are faster, more efficient or less costly than that which can be achieved using iBio technologies. There has been and continues to be substantial academic and commercial research effort devoted to the development of such methods and processes. If successful competitive methods are developed, it may undermine the commercial basis for iBio products and our technologies and related services.\nFor our cancer product candidates, not only do we compete with companies engaged in various cancer treatments including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but we also compete with various companies that have developed or are trying to develop immunology vaccines for the treatment of cancer. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, large customer bases, broader product lines, sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs with extensive facilities and equipment than we do and have more established reputations as well as global distribution channels. Our most significant competitors, among others, are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, MedImmune, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc), Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., MerckKGaA and Sanofi SA, and more established biotechnology companies such as Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group), Amgen Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc. and its subsidiary Kite Pharma, Inc., and competing cancer immunotherapy companies such as, Bluebird Bio, Inc., Transgene SA, Bausch Health Companies, NewLink Genetics Corporation, Agenus Inc., Aduro Biotech, Inc., Advaxis, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., IMV Inc., Oxford BioMedica plc, Bavarian Nordic A/S, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.,\nWe have recently announced preclinical testing of a new vaccine program for treatment of certain patients with COVID-19. This SARS-CoV2 disease is extremely challenging and there are many companies addressing COVID-19, both in vaccines and therapeutic treatments, many of which have significantly greater resources and capital than we do and are further along in the clinic than we are. Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson have already developed a COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use in the United States and elsewhere, and many more, including several that have progressed further than us, including Oxford-AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Inovio, Takara Bio and Novavax, are in various stages of development, some of which have already received approval for emergency use in some European countries. Various government entities, including the U.S. government, are offering incentives, grants and contracts to encourage additional investment by commercial organizations into preventative and therapeutic agents against coronavirus, which may have the effect of increasing the number of competitors and/or providing advantages to known competitors. The competition for funding research and development in this disease, including grant funding, is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate funding to carry out our development plan or that, even if funding is obtained, our vaccine will be effective, timely, and accepted by appropriate regulatory authorities. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish a competitive market share for our COVID-19 vaccine, if any.\nWe will face competition from other drugs currently approved or that will be approved in the future for the treatment of the diseases we are currently targeting. Therefore, our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to:\n\u25cf develop and commercialize product candidates that are superior to other products in the market;\n\u25cf demonstrate through our clinical trials that our clinical product candidate is differentiated from existing and future therapies;\n\u25cf attract qualified scientific and commercial personnel;\n\u25cf obtain patent or other proprietary protection for its clinical product candidate;\n\u25cf obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from, and negotiate competitive pricing with, third-party payors; and\n\u25cf successfully develop and commercialize, independently or with collaborators, new product candidates.\nThe availability of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any product candidate we develop. The inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced therapies would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nEstablished pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make our product candidate less competitive. In addition, any new products that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, discovering, developing, receiving the FDA\u2019s approval for or commercializing medicines before we do, which would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur clinical product candidate may exhibit undesirable side effects when used alone or in combination with other approved pharmaceutical products, which may delay or preclude its development or regulatory approval, or limit its use if ever approved.\nThroughout the drug development process, we must continually demonstrate the activity, safety, and tolerability of our clinical product candidate in order to obtain regulatory approval to further advance our clinical development, or to eventually market it. Even if our clinical product candidate demonstrates adequate biologic activity and clear clinical benefit, any unacceptable side effects or adverse events, when administered alone or in the presence of other pharmaceutical products, may outweigh these potential benefits. We may observe adverse or serious adverse events or drug-drug interactions in preclinical studies or clinical trials of our clinical product candidate, which could result in the delay or termination of its development, prevent regulatory approval, or limit its market acceptance if it is ultimately approved.\nAdverse events caused by our clinical product candidates or generally by plant-based therapeutics could cause reviewing entities, clinical trial sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval. If an unacceptable frequency or severity of adverse events are reported in our clinical trials for our clinical product candidates, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for such clinical product candidate may be negatively impacted. In addition, adverse events caused by any clinical product candidate administered in combination with our product candidates could cause similar interruptions and delays, even though not caused by our clinical product candidates.\nFurthermore, if any of our products are approved and then cause serious or unexpected side effects, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the clinical product candidate or impose restrictions on its distribution or other risk management measures;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u25cf we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for injuries sustained by patients;\n\u25cf we could elect to discontinue the sale of the clinical product candidate; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected clinical product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercialization.\nOur failure to receive or maintain regulatory approval for product candidates developed at our facility could negatively impact our revenue and profitability.\nOur contract manufacturing business materially depends upon the regulatory approval of the products we manufacture. As such, if we experience a delay in, or failure to provide, approval for any product candidates we are manufacturing or if we or our customers fail to maintain regulatory approval of their products, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. Additionally, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve of our facilities for the manufacture of a customer product or if it withdraws such approval in the future, our customers may choose to identify alternative manufacturing facilities and/or relationships, which could significantly impact our ability to expand our CDMO capacity and capabilities and achieve profitability.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face the risk of product liability exposure in connection with the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nPrior to commencing human clinical trials, we will seek to obtain product liability insurance coverage. Such insurance coverage is expensive and may not be available in coverage amounts we seek or at all. If we obtain such coverage, we may in the future be unable to maintain such coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nFor our clinical product candidates, we intend to use our own manufacturing facility. Any manufacturing problems experienced by us could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of our clinical product candidate until the problem is cured or until we locate and qualify an alternative source of manufacturing and supply.\nWe currently manufacture our clinical product candidates and do not have a second alternative manufacturer. If we were to experience any prolonged disruption for our manufacturing, we could be forced to seek additional third-party manufacturing contracts, thereby increasing our development costs and negatively impacting our timelines and any commercialization costs. If we change manufacturers at any point during the development process or after approval of a product candidate, we will be required to demonstrate comparability between the product manufactured by the old manufacturer and the product manufactured by the new manufacturer. If we are unable to do so we may need to conduct additional clinical trials with product manufactured by the new manufacturer.\nIf we are not able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our clinical product candidate, our development activities would be impaired. In addition, the manufacturing facility where our clinical product candidate is manufactured is subject to ongoing, periodic inspection by the FDA or other comparable regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP. Any failure to follow and document the manufacturer\u2019s adherence to such cGMP regulations or other regulatory requirements may lead to significant delays in the availability of clinical bulk drug substance and finished product for clinical trials, which may result in the termination of or a hold on a clinical trial, or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our clinical product candidate. We also may encounter problems with the following:\n\u25cf achieving adequate or clinical-grade materials that meet FDA or other comparable regulatory agency standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yield and costs;\n\u25cf failing to develop an acceptable formulation to support late-stage clinical trials for, or the commercialization of, our clinical product candidate;\n\u25cf being unable to increase the scale of or the capacity for, or reformulate the form of our clinical product candidate, which may cause us to experience a shortage in supply, or cause the cost to manufacture our clinical product candidate to increase.\n\u25cf we cannot assure you that we will be able to manufacture our clinical product candidate at a suitable commercial scale, or that we will be able to find alternative manufacturers acceptable to us that can do so;\n\u25cf our facility closing as a result of regulatory sanctions, pandemic or a natural disaster;\n\u25cf shortages of qualified personnel, raw materials or key contractors;\n\u25cf failing to obtain FDA approval for commercial scale manufacturing; and\n\u25cf ongoing compliance with cGMP regulations and other requirements of the FDA or other comparable regulatory agencies.\nIf we encounter any of these problems or are otherwise delayed, or if the cost of manufacturing is not economically feasible or we cannot find another third-party manufacturer, we may not be able to produce our clinical product candidate in a sufficient quantity to meet future demand.\nThese risks are likely to be exacerbated by our limited experience with our current products and manufacturing processes. If demand for our products materializes, we may have to invest additional resources to purchase materials, hire and train employees, and enhance our manufacturing processes. It may not be possible for us to manufacture our clinical product candidate at a cost or in quantities sufficient to make its clinical product candidate commercially viable. Any of these factors may affect our ability to manufacture our products and could reduce gross margins and profitability.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufacture our clinical product candidate ourselves, including:\n\u25cf reliance on the third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u25cf the possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control or the insolvency of any of these third parties or other financial difficulties, labor unrest, natural disasters or other factors adversely affecting their ability to conduct their business; and\n\u25cf possibility of termination or non-renewal of the agreements by the third parties, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us, because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities.\nIf we rely on a third party contract manufacturer or its suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of our clinical product candidate required for our clinical trials and, if approved, for commercial sale, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers or suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality, and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and would have to delay or terminate our pre-clinical or clinical trials, and we would lose potential revenue. It may also take significant time to establish an alternative source of supply for our clinical product candidate and to have any such new source approved by the FDA or any applicable foreign regulatory authorities. Furthermore, any of the above factors could cause the delay or suspension of initiation or completion of clinical trials, regulatory submissions or required approvals of our clinical product candidate, cause it to incur higher costs and could prevent us from commercializing our clinical product candidate successfully.\nRisks Related to Dependence on Third Parties\nIf we are unable to establish new collaborations and maintain both new and existing collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur current business plan contemplates that we will in the future derive significant revenues from collaborators and licensees that successfully utilize iBio technologies in connection with the production, development and commercialization of vaccines and therapeutic protein product candidates. Our realization of these revenues and dependence on existing collaborations, and any future collaborations we enter into, is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u25cf collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u25cf collaborators may not pursue development and, if successful, commercialization of product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u25cf collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products; or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u25cf collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u25cf collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we would potentially lose the right to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;\n\u25cf collaborators may learn about our technology and use this knowledge to compete with us in the future;\n\u25cf results of collaborators\u2019 preclinical or clinical studies could produce results that harm or impair other products using our technology;\n\u25cf there may be conflicts between different collaborators that could negatively affect those collaborations and others; and\n\u25cf the number and type of our collaborations could adversely affect our attractiveness to future collaborators or acquirers.\nIf our collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one or more of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research and development funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our continued development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop additional product candidates. There can be no assurance that our collaborations will produce positive results or successful products on a timely basis or at all.\nWe seek to establish and collaborate with additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development and potential commercialization of iBio technology-produced and iBio technology-enhanced product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration depends, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of several factors. If we fail to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development or the development of one or more of our other product candidates, or increase our expenditures and undertake additional development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we\nelect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product portfolio and our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf third parties on whom we or our licensees will rely for the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials do not perform as contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business may suffer.\nWe have limited resources dedicated to designing, conducting, and managing our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We do not have the ability to independently conduct the preclinical studies and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. We have not yet contracted with any third parties to conduct clinical trials of product candidates we develop independently of collaborators. We will depend on licensees or on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct the clinical trials of our product candidates. We will rely on these vendors and individuals to perform many facets of the clinical development process on our behalf, including conducting preclinical studies and will rely on them for the recruitment of sites and subjects for participation in our clinical trials, maintenance of good relations with the clinical sites, and ensuring that these sites are conducting our trials in compliance with the trial protocol and applicable regulations.\nWe will rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials but will not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the investigators participating in our clinical trials will not be our employees. However, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates. If these third parties fail to perform satisfactorily, or do not adequately fulfill their obligations under the terms of our agreements with them, we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements without undue delay or additional expenditures, and therefore the preclinical studies and clinical trials of our clinical product candidate may be delayed or prove unsuccessful.\nFurther, the FDA, the EMA, or similar regulatory authorities in other countries, may inspect some of the clinical sites participating in our clinical trials or our third-party vendors\u2019 sites to determine if our clinical trials are being conducted according to good clinical practices, or GCPs, or similar regulations. If we or a regulatory authority determine that our third-party vendors are not in compliance with, or have not conducted our clinical trials according to applicable regulations, we may be forced to exclude certain data from the results of the trial, or delay, repeat or terminate such clinical trials.\nIf revenue from a third-party customer or client is concentrated in an amount that makes up a significant percentage of our total revenues, we may be adversely impacted by the significant dependence upon that client, including but not limited to, receipt and collections of outstanding amounts, significant percentage use iBio\u2019s capacity, the opportunity cost of more profitable opportunities using our capacity, of continued operational allocations toward the client and related efficiencies.\nTo date, our revenue has been derived from a small number of clients upon which our revenue has been dependent. At this time, we are continually promoting our technologies and CDMO capabilities to further expand and grow our revenue base and business. We will continue to consider any potential revenue and client related concentration risks. Although we expect our revenues to increase significantly and further vary by client over the next twelve months, there are no guarantees we will be correct in our assumptions. If we continue to derive our revenue from a small number of clients, we will remain dependent upon these clients for our revenue generation and the ability of the clients to use our services.\nWe rely on third parties to supply most of the necessary raw materials and supplies for the products we manufacture on behalf of our customers and our inability to obtain such raw materials or supplies may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations require various raw materials, including proprietary resins, buffers, and filters, in addition to numerous additional raw materials supplied primarily by third parties. We or our customers specify the raw materials and other items required to manufacture their product and, in some cases, specify the suppliers from whom we must purchase these raw materials. In certain instances, the raw materials and other items can only be supplied by a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single source, or in limited quantities. If third-party suppliers do not supply raw materials or other items on a timely basis, it may cause a manufacturing run to be delayed or canceled which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. If we experience difficulties acquiring sufficient quantities of required materials or products from our existing suppliers, or if our suppliers are found to be non-compliant with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulation, cGMP or other applicable laws or regulations, we would be required to find alternative suppliers. If our primary suppliers become unable or unwilling to perform, any resulting delays or interruptions in the supply of raw materials required to support our manufacturing of cGMP pharmaceutical-grade products would ultimately delay our manufacture of products for our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nFurthermore, third-party suppliers may fail to provide us with raw materials and other items that meet the qualifications and specifications required by us or our customers. If third-party suppliers are not able to provide us with raw materials that meet our or our customers\u2019 specifications on a timely basis, we may be unable to manufacture their product or it could prevent us from delivering products to our customers within required timeframes. Any such delay in delivering our products may create liability for us to our customers for breach of contract or cause us to experience order cancellations and loss of customers. In the event that we manufacture products with inferior quality components and raw materials, we may become subject to product liability claims caused by defective raw materials or components from a third-party supplier or from a customer, or our customer may be required to recall its products from the market.\nAny claims beyond our insurance coverage limits, or that are otherwise not covered by our insurance, may result in substantial costs and a reduction in our available capital resources.\nWe maintain property insurance, employer\u2019s liability insurance, product liability insurance, general liability insurance, business interruption insurance, and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, among others. Although we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage, potential claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy, which could cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. Generally, we would be at risk for the loss of inventory that is not within customer specifications. These amounts could be significant. In addition, in the future we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage or we may be required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage.\nWe may be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings.\nWe, as well as certain of our directors and officers, may be subject to claims or lawsuits during the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses and could divert management\u2019s time and other resources. If the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us, we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices. Any of these outcomes could cause our business, financial performance and cash position to be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product candidates, and by maintenance of our trade secrets through proper procedures.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and we may fail to seek or obtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 00 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, nor can we know whether those from whom we license patents were the first to make the inventions claimed or were the first to file. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. PTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nEven if our pending or future patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Competitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, which could adversely affect us and our collaborators.\nWhile no such litigation has been brought against us and we have not been held by any court to have infringed a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we cannot guarantee that our technology, products or use of our products do not infringe third-party patents. It is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000, and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing date, which is referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our products or technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our products or the use of our products.\nWe may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. PTO and similar bodies in other countries. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing intellectual property rights and intellectual property rights that may be granted in the future.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nIn addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nIf we are found to have failed to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to an exclusive license agreement with University of Pittsburgh, as well as a non-exclusive license agreement with the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, and an exclusive license agreement with RubrYc and a collaboration, option and license agreement with RubrYc and may need to obtain additional licenses from others to advance our research and development activities or allow the commercialization of our lead products or other product candidates that we may identify. Our license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various development, diligence, commercialization, and other obligations on us. Our prospects for our fibrosis product candidate (IBIO-100), which is now one of our primary focuses, is significantly dependent upon our license agreement with the University of Pittsburgh. The license grants us exclusive, worldwide rights to certain existing patents and related intellectual property that cover fibrosis. If we breach the terms of the license, including any failure to make minimum royalty payments required thereunder or failure to reach certain developmental milestones and by certain deadlines or other factors, University of Pittsburgh has the right to terminate the license. Under the terms and conditions of the license agreement, as amended, we have agreed to use our best efforts to bring the licensed technology to market as soon as practicable, consistent with sound and reasonable business practice and judgment, and to continue active, diligent marketing efforts for the licensed technology throughout the term of this Agreement. In addition, this license agreement, as amended sets forth the following specific milestone completion deadlines: filing an investigational new drug application by December 31, 2021, enrollment of first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial by March 31, 2022, enrollment of first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial by June 30, 2023, enrollment of first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial by June 30, 2026 and filing of a Biologics License Application or foreign equivalent by December 21, 2029. Although we intend to commence initiation of IND-enabling studies in fiscal 2022, there can be no assurance that we will complete the necessary studies in order to allow for us to file an IND by December 31, 2021. If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain the license on acceptable terms or find that it is necessary or appropriate to secure new licenses from other third parties, we may not be able to further develop or market IBIO-100.\nThe commercial license with RubrYc exclusively permits us to research, develop, make, have made, manufacture, use, distribute, sell, offer for sale, import, and export antibodies in RubrYc\u2019s RTX-003. Under the terms and conditions of the RTX-003 License Agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize RTX-003 antibodies. If we fail to achieve certain timing milestones for starting GMP manufacturing and dosing human patients under an IND, we could be required to make a payment to RubrYc on the date the milestone is missed and on each anniversary of such date until the milestone is achieved, provided that the milestone was missed due to our failure to exercise commercially reasonable efforts. If we breach the terms of the license agreement with RubrYc, RubrYc has the right to terminate the license agreement. In addition, the collaboration, option and license agreement with RubrYc provides that in the event the option is exercised by us, we have various diligence obligations including that we will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) develop Selected Compounds for use in pharmaceutical products (the \u201cCollaboration Products\u201d); and (ii) commercialize the Collaboration Products. In addition, we are also required to meet a series of development milestones for each Collaboration Product. Failure to achieve the milestones will result in a payment to RubrYc on the date the milestone is missed and on each anniversary of such date until the milestone is achieved, provided that the milestone was missed due to our failure to exercise commercially reasonable efforts. If we breach the terms of the collaboration, option and license agreement with RubrYc, they have the right to terminate the license agreement.\nIn spite of our efforts, our licensors might allege that we have materially breached our obligations under such license agreements and might therefore attempt to terminate the license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors or other third parties might have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours and we may be required to cease our development and commercialization of our lead products or other product candidates that we may identify. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nMoreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u2022 the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022 the extent to which our product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022 the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n\u2022 our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022 the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and\n\u2022 the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nIf we are unable to protect our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also seek to enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Our trade secrets may also be obtained by third parties by other means, such as breaches of our physical or computer security systems. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patent filings and other intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. These employees typically executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with their previous employers. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. We or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we or our licensors may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or our or our licensors\u2019 ownership of our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our product candidates. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, while we require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u25cf others may be able to make products that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we license;\n\u25cf our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by an issued patent or pending patent application;\n\u25cf our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering an invention;\n\u25cf others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our or our licensors\u2019 technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf pending patent applications may not lead to issued patents;\n\u25cf issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u25cf our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u25cf we may not develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business; and\n\u25cf we may choose not to file a patent application for certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently obtain a patent covering such intellectual property.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIf we should fail to comply with various patent laws our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO\nand various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in patent law, including recent patent reform legislation, could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013, but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our or our licensor\u2019s patents or patent applications. In addition, the patent positions of companies in the development and commercialization of pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nRisks Related to iBio\u2019s Operations\nOur operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to maximize our facility capacity utilization.\niBio CDMO\u2019s operating results are significantly influenced by our capacity utilization and, as such, if we are unable to utilize our facilities to capacity, our margins could be adversely affected, and our results of operations and financial condition will continue to be adversely affected. Further, while we continue to implement and execute our business plan and attract and maintain customers for our development, manufacturing and technology transfer services, our revenue volume may be insufficient to ensure the economical operation of our facilities, in which case our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFor our clinical product candidate and our CDMO business, we intend to use our own manufacturing facility. Any manufacturing problems experienced by us could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of our clinical product candidate until the problem is cured or until we locate and qualify an alternative source of manufacturing and supply.\nWe rely on the continuous operation of our only manufacturing facility in Texas for the production of our products. We currently manufacture our clinical product candidates and perform services for our CDMO customers at our facility located in Texas and do not have a second alternative manufacturer. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facility due to fire, flood, earthquake, or any other unforeseen circumstance would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, adverse weather conditions, such as increased frequency and/or severity of storms, or floods could impair our ability to operate by damaging our facilities and equipment or restricting product delivery to customers. The occurrence of any disruption at our manufacturing facility, even for a short period of time, may\nhave an adverse effect on our productivity and profitability, during and after the period of the disruption. If we were to experience any prolonged disruption for our manufacturing, we could be forced to seek additional third-party manufacturing contracts, thereby increasing our development costs and negatively impacting our timelines and any commercialization costs. If we change manufacturers at any point during the development process or after approval of a product candidate, we will be required to demonstrate comparability between the product manufactured by the old manufacturer and the product manufactured by the new manufacturer. If we are unable to do so we may need to conduct additional clinical trials with product manufactured by the new manufacturer.\nA failure by iBio to hire and retain an appropriately skilled and adequate workforce could adversely impact the ability of the facility to operate and function efficiently.\niBio\u2019s operations will depend, in part, on their ability to attract and retain an appropriately skilled and sufficient workforce to operate its development and manufacturing facility as well as its R&D facility. These employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. Both facilities are located in a growing biotechnology hubs and competition for skilled workers will continue to increase as the industry undergoes further growth in the area. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain key personnel, or to attract and retain additional qualified employees. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel as we grow in two locations may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to provide quality and timely services to our customers, our business could suffer.\nThe manufacturing services we conduct are highly complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. A failure of our quality control systems in our facilities could cause problems to arise in connection with facility operations for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, viral contamination, failure to follow specific manufacturing instructions, protocols and standard operating procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors. Such problems could affect production of a single manufacturing run or a series of runs, requiring the destruction of products, or could halt manufacturing operations altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such incident could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug substance, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other manufacturing runs. With respect to our commercial manufacturing, if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, we may be subject to regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such issues could subject us to litigation, the cost of which could be significant.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur CDMO operations are highly regulated, and we must comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, provincial, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities in which we manufacture products or in which our customers\u2019 products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with cGMPs, import and export, and product registration and listing, among other things. As a result, our facility is subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions where our customers have marketing approval for their products. As we expand our operations and geographic scope, we may be exposed to more complex and newer regulatory and administrative requirements and legal risks, any of which may require expertise in which we have little or no experience. It is possible that compliance with new regulatory requirements could impose significant compliance costs on us. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\niBio CDMO\u2019s operations are also subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those of the Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent local and state agencies. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Any failure to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or monetary fines or civil or\ncriminal sanctions, or other future liabilities. iBio CDMO is also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and the handling and disposal of regulated material.\nNot only will our customers\u2019 products be subject to the regulatory approvals discussed above that our proprietary products will be subject to, but our facility is subject to governmental approval for the testing or manufacturing of products If our manufacturing facility is not able to demonstrate compliance with cGMPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies, the FDA or other regulatory agencies can delay approval of a customers\u2019 drug candidate.\nIn addition, if new legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards. This may require a change in our development and manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facility. Any related costs may be significant. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the future, then we may be subject to warning letters and/or civil or criminal penalties and fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, restrictions on the import and export of our products, debarment, exclusion, disgorgement of profits, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution and the loss of contracts and resulting revenue losses. Inspections by regulatory authorities that identify any deficiencies could result in remedial actions, production stoppages or facility closure, which would disrupt the manufacturing process and supply of product to our customers. In addition, such failure to comply could expose us to contractual and product liability claims, including claims by customers for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or recall or other corrective actions, the cost of which could be significant.\nThe FDA and comparable government authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which we or our customers intend to market their products have the authority to withdraw product approval or suspend manufacture if there are significant problems with raw materials or supplies, quality control and assurance or the product we manufacture is adulterated or misbranded. If our manufacturing facilities and services are not in compliance with the FDA and comparable government authorities, we may be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary approvals to continue manufacturing products for our customers, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\nWe intend to grow our business operations as demand increases and increase the number of our employees to accommodate such potential growth, which may cause us to experience periods of rapid growth and expansion. This potential future growth could create a strain on our organizational, administrative and operational infrastructure, including manufacturing operations, quality control, technical support and other administrative functions. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls.\nAs our commercial operations and sales volume grow, we will need to continue to increase our capacity for manufacturing, customer service, billing and general process improvements and expand our internal quality assurance program, among other things. We may also need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months or more to procure, set up and validate, and increase our manufacturing, maintenance, software and computing capacity to meet increased demand. These increases in scale, expansion of personnel, purchase of equipment or process enhancements may not be successfully implemented.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our customers\u2019 proprietary information, we may be subject to claims.\nMany of the formulations used and processes developed by us in manufacturing our customers\u2019 products are subject to trade secret protection, patents or other intellectual property protections owned or licensed by such customer. While we make significant efforts to protect our customers\u2019 proprietary and confidential information, including requiring our employees to enter into agreements protecting such information, if any of our employees breaches the non-disclosure provisions in such agreements, or if our customers make claims that their proprietary information has been disclosed, our reputation may suffer damage and we may become subject to legal proceedings that could require us to incur significant expenses and divert our management\u2019s time, attention and resources.\nIf we acquire companies, products or technologies, we may face integration risks and costs associated with those acquisitions that could negatively impact our business, results from operations and financial condition.\nIf we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies. We may not realize the anticipated benefit of any acquisition or investment. If we acquire companies or technologies, we will face risks, uncertainties and disruptions associated with the integration process, including difficulties in the integration of the operations of an acquired company, integration of acquired technology with our products, diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired business, and impairment charges if future acquisitions are not as successful as we originally anticipate. In addition, our operating results may suffer because of acquisition-related costs or amortization expenses or charges relating to acquired intangible assets. Any failure to successfully integrate other companies, products, or technologies that we may acquire may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any additional future acquisitions or investments, the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nWe rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to operate our CDMO business and our research and development activities and do not have any long-term commitments from such suppliers.\nWe currently rely on third parties for the raw materials needed to operate our CDMO business and our research and development activities. We do not have any long-term commitments from any raw material suppliers and therefore cannot guarantee that there will be adequate supply of our raw materials. Natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our suppliers\u2019 facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products. Influenza or other pandemics, such as the new coronavirus, could disrupt production of our products, reduce demand for certain of our products, or disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations. To the extent we are unable to, or cannot, financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chain. Although we believe we have sufficient supply of our other raw materials at this time, due to supply chain shortages, we may not be able to obtain such materials in the future is our current suppliers should be unable to satisfy our needs. Such suppliers may not be able to provide us with engines in a timely manner due to supply chain shortages and even if other suppliers are able to fulfill our needs they may not be able to do so at the same price as we currently pay for such materials, which could result in lower profit margins or us increasing the price of our services in order to maintain profit margins which could adversely impact demand for our services.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\niBio is subject to compliance under the NYSE American continued listing standards of the NYSE American Company Guide, the failure of which can result in delisting from the NYSE American.\nIn order to maintain its listing with NYSE American, we must remain in compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d), including the listing standard set forth in Section 1003 of the Guide, which applies if a listed company has stockholders\u2019 equity below certain threshold amounts and has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. In the past, we have received notification of noncompliance with the continued listing requirements, which to date have been remediated\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to meet all of the Exchange\u2019s continued listing standards, or exemptions therefrom, in the future.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and provisions of applicable Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock. Any additional issuance of common stock could have the effect of impeding or discouraging the acquisition of control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, including a transaction in which our stockholders would receive a premium over the market price for their shares, and thereby protect the continuity of our management. Specifically, if in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, the Board of Directors were to determine that a takeover proposal was not in our best interest, shares could be issued by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval in one or more transactions that might prevent or render more difficult or costly the completion of the takeover by:\n\u25cf diluting the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder group,\n\u25cf putting a substantial voting bloc in institutional or other hands that might undertake to support the incumbent Board of Directors, or\n\u25cf effecting an acquisition that might complicate or preclude the takeover.\nOur certificate of incorporation also allows our Board of Directors to fix the number of directors in the by-laws. Our certificate of incorporation does not contemplate cumulative voting in the election of directors and thus, under Delaware law, cumulative voting in the election of directors is not permitted. Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, each of which serves for a staggered term of three years. This division of our Board of Directors could have the effect of impeding an attempt to take over our company or change or remove management, since only one class will be elected annually. Thus, only approximately one-third of the existing Board of Directors could be replaced at any election of directors.\nThe effect of these provisions may be to delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder may determine to be in his, her or its best interest, including attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by the stockholders.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and therefore investors should not buy our stock if they wish to receive cash dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nThe issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of the holders of shares of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the voting rights, rights of redemption and other rights and preferences of preferred stock. Currently, we have one share of preferred stock outstanding. Our Board of Directors may, at any time, designate a new series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock, and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, before the redemption of our common stock and authorize the issuance of such series of preferred stock, which may have a material adverse effect on the rights of the holders of our common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may, at any time, issue large blocks of preferred stock. In addition, the ability of our Board of Directors to designate and issue shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our stockholders may impede a takeover of our company and may prevent a transaction that is favorable to our stockholders.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems and are vulnerable to damage and interruption\nWe rely on our information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client and supplier information. Additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer and process data. Our information technology systems, as well as the systems of our suppliers and other partners, whose systems we do not control, are vulnerable to outages and an increasing risk of continually evolving deliberate intrusions to gain access to company sensitive information. Likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. A cyber-attack or other significant disruption involving our information technology systems, or those of our vendors, suppliers and other partners, could also result in disruptions in critical systems, corruption or loss of data and theft of data, funds or intellectual property. A security breach of any kind, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and attacks by hackers, employees or others, could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, government enforcement actions, regulatory penalties and costly response measures, and could seriously disrupt our operations. We may be unable to prevent outages or security breaches in our systems. We remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or yet unknown threats as, in some instances, we, our suppliers and our other partners may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We also face the risk that we expose our vendors or partners to cybersecurity attacks. Any or all of the foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and our business reputation.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and adversely affected by various factors.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future. By way of example, on December 31, 2020, the price of our common stock closed at $1.05 per share while on February 9, 2021, our stock price closed at $2.62 per share with no discernable announcements or developments by us or third parties. On February 3, 2021, the intra-day sales price of our common stock fluctuated between a reported low sale price of $1.78 and a reported high sales price of $2.24. We may incur rapid and substantial decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition, the recent outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused broad stock market and industry fluctuations. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:\n\u25cfinvestor reaction to our business strategy;\n\u25cfthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cfour continued compliance with the listing standards of the NYSE American;\n\u25cfresults of our preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nactions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our products, clinical studies, manufacturing process or sales and marketing terms;\n\u25cfvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our products;\n\u25cfour ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u25cfdeclines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u25cftrading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cfsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u25cf announcements of licensing or other business development initiatives\n\u25cfgeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u25cf\nother events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of our suppliers or result in political or economic instability.\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Since the stock price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past, has been recently volatile and may be volatile in the future, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current prices or that future sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our common stock price and trading volume.\nSecurities research analysts, including those affiliated with our underwriters from prior offerings, establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match securities research analysts\u2019 projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who writes reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline. While we expect securities research analyst coverage to continue going forward, if no securities or industry analysts begin to cover us, the trading price for our stock and the trading volume could be adversely affected.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company\" as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. We may remain a smaller reporting company until we have a non-affiliate public float in excess of $250 million and annual revenues in excess of $100 million, or a non-affiliate public float in excess of $700 million, each as determined on an annual basis. For so long as we remain smaller reporting company, we are permitted and may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:\n\u25cf an exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, on the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u25cf an exemption from compliance with any requirement that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; and\n\u25cf reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.\nWe cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on such exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, security holders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us, as and when required, conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, as and when required, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. During the fiscal year 2020 fourth quarter, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Although we have remedied the identified material weaknesses, there can be no assurance that we will not in the future encounter additional material weaknesses in internal control, especially in light of our small internal accounting staff and overall growth. As a growing company, implementing and maintaining effective controls may require more resources, and we may encounter internal control integration difficulties. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404, we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, as a smaller reporting company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm until we are no longer a smaller reporting company. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.", "PERMNO": 12527, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "IBIO"}
