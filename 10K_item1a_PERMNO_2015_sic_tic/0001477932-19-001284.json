{"cik": "1084554", "company": "LIGHTBRIDGE Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to the Company\nWe will need to raise significant additional capital in the future to expand our operations and continue our research and development and we may be unable to raise such funds when needed or on acceptable terms, and any capital raises may cause significant dilution to our shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $24.6 million in cash and equivalents, and as of March 1, 2019, we had approximately $23 million in cash and equivalents. We will need to raise significant additional capital in order to continue our research and development activities and fund our operations through commercialization of our nuclear fuel technology, including funding Enfission for 2019 and beyond. Our current plan is to maximize external funding from third party sources to support the remaining development, testing and demonstration activities relating to our metallic nuclear fuel technology.\nWhen we elect to raise additional funds or additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or other financing alternatives. Additional equity or debt financing or other alternative sources of capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, if we are unable to demonstrate meaningful progress in our Enfission joint venture with Framatome to further the development of our fuel products, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline in the future. New investors may have rights superior to existing securityholders. Debt financing, if available, would result in substantial fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to fully develop our nuclear fuel designs, our future operations will be limited, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain future profitability will be substantially harmed. In particular, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or terminate one or more of our research projects, sell rights to our nuclear fuel technology or license the rights to such technologies on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or securities convertible into equity, further dilution to stockholders may result and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\nWe are dependent upon a joint venture for substantially all of our anticipated future income.\nIn January 2018, we entered into the Enfission joint venture with Framatome. We anticipate that distributions from Enfission and licensing revenue from nuclear fuel sold by Enfission will constitute substantially all of our income in the future. We are dependent upon the success or failure of Enfission, and if Enfission is not successful or Enfission does not perform its research and development activities as expected, our future financial performance will be negatively impacted.\nOur Enfission joint venture could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partner and our exposure to potential losses from the joint venture.\nJoint ventures involve risks not present in investments or operations in which a third party is not involved, including the possibility that a joint venture partner may at any time have other business interests and investments other than the joint venture with us, may have economic or business goals different from ours, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Conflicts of interest may cause a joint venture partner to take actions that could harm the joint venture or the Company, such as seeking undue benefit from the joint venture or its assets or operations, acting in bad faith to undermine the joint venture or its operations, or causing unnecessary expense or delay. A joint venture partner may also become bankrupt or fail to fund its required capital contributions. Consequently, actions by or disputes with a joint venture partner might result in subjecting our business to additional risk.\nUnder the Enfission operating agreement, neither we nor Framatome are in a position to unilaterally control the joint venture, and deadlocks may occur. Such deadlocks could adversely impact the operations and profitability of Enfission, including delaying the commercialization of nuclear fuel incorporating our technology. Disputes between us and Framatome may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.\nNeither Framatome nor Enfission is a publicly reporting entity in the United States, and as such they are not subject to the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other SEC rules and regulations applicable to the Company. If Framatome or Enfission does not comply with the information and notice provisions set forth in the Enfission operating agreement and/or Research and Development Services Agreement, the Company may not be able to satisfy its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act or maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, and our business, the market value of our securities and our access to capital markets could be materially adversely affected. Non-compliance by Framatome or Enfission could also adversely impact the operations and profitability of Enfission, including delaying the commercialization of nuclear fuel incorporating our technology.\nIn addition, the Enfission joint venture may result in other difficulties including, among other things, diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and managing regulatory compliance and corporate governance matters.\nOur interest in Enfission exposes us to risks related to the manufacturing of nuclear fuel.\nHistorically, we anticipated licensing our nuclear fuel technology to third parties that would undertake the manufacturing and sale of nuclear fuel incorporating our technology. With our entry into the Enfission joint venture, we will be indirectly exposed to certain risks in connection with the manufacturing of nuclear fuel, including procurement, quality assurance, regulatory, environmental and litigation risks. If such risks or other anticipated or unanticipated liabilities were to materialize, any desired benefits of our entry into the joint venture may not be fully realized, if at all, and our future financial performance may be negatively impacted.\nIf the price of non-nuclear energy sources falls, whether as the result of government policy or otherwise, there could be an adverse impact on nuclear energy, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nIn certain markets with a diversified energy base, decisions on new build power plants are largely affected by the economics of various energy sources. If prices of non-nuclear energy sources fall, it could limit the deployment of new build nuclear power plants in such markets. This could reduce the size of the potential markets for both our fuel technology and our consulting services.\nIn addition, many states and the federal government have adopted a variety of government subsidies and utility incentives to allow renewable energy sources, such as biofuels, wind and solar energy, to compete with conventional sources of energy that have historically been less expensive, such as fossil fuels and nuclear power. We may face additional competition from providers of renewable energy sources, particularly in wind and solar energy, if government subsidies and utility incentives for those sources of energy remain or increase or if such sources of energy are mandated. Additionally, the availability of subsidies and other incentives from utilities or government agencies to install alternative renewable energy sources may negatively impact our potential customers\u2019 desire to purchase our products and services, or may be utilized by our existing or new competitors to develop a competing business model or products or services that may be potentially more attractive to customers than ours, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets and worldwide economic downturn.\nOur future results may be adversely affected by the worldwide economic downturn, continued volatility or further deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets, inflation, deflation, or other adverse economic conditions that may negatively affect us. At present, it is likely that we will require additional capital in the near future in order to fund our operations. Due to the above listed factors, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur limited operating history with our joint venture with Framatome makes it difficult to judge our prospects.\nThe success of our research and development activities, like other competing research and development projects similar to ours, is uncertain. If such efforts are not successful, we will be unable to generate revenues from our operations and we may have to cease doing business. Similarly, our fuel design patents and technology have not been commercially used and we have not received any royalty or sales revenue from this area of our business. We are subject to the risks, expenses and problems frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development.\nWe rely upon certain members of our senior management, including Seth Grae, Andrey Mushakov, and Larry Goldman and the loss of any of Mr. Grae, Mr. Mushakov, or Mr. Goldman or any of our management team would have an adverse effect on the Company.\nOur success depends upon certain members of our senior management, including Seth Grae, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Andrey Mushakov, our Executive Vice President - Nuclear Operations, and Larry Goldman, our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Grae\u2019s and Mr. Mushakov\u2019s knowledge of the nuclear power industry, their network of key contacts within that industry and in governments and, in particular, their expertise in the potential markets for our technologies, are critical to the implementation of our business model. Mr. Grae, Mr. Mushakov, or Mr. Goldman are likely to be significant factors in our future growth and success. The loss of services by either Mr. Grae, Mr. Mushakov, or Mr. Goldman could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Also, we rely heavily on other members of our management team and our inability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of consultants and managers could adversely affect our ability to meet client needs and to continue the development of our fuel designs.\nCompetition for highly qualified technical personnel is intense in our industry.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to contract with, hire, integrate and retain engineers and scientists, and other qualified personnel with a focus in our nuclear fuel technology and products. Competition for these skilled professionals is intense. If we are unable to adequately anticipate our needs for certain key competences and implement human resource solutions to recruit or improve these competences, our business, results of operations and financial condition would suffer. In addition, a loss of the service of any of our existing skilled employees or contractors could have a significant negative effect on our ability to operate.\nSuccessful execution of our business model is dependent upon public support for nuclear power and overcoming public opposition to nuclear energy as a result of the major nuclear accident at Fukushima.\nSuccessful execution of our business model is dependent upon public support for nuclear power in the United States and other countries. Nuclear power faces strong opposition from certain competitive energy sources, individuals, and organizations. The major nuclear accident that occurred at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan beginning on March 11, 2011 increased public opposition to nuclear power in some countries, resulting in a slowdown in, or, in some cases, a complete halt to, new construction of nuclear power plants, an early shut down of existing power plants, or a dampening of the favorable regulatory climate needed to introduce new nuclear technologies. In addition, the Fukushima accident appears to have shrunk the projected size of the global nuclear power market in 2025-2030 as reflected in the most recent reference case projections published by the World Nuclear Association. As a result of the Fukushima accident, some countries that were considering launching new domestic nuclear power programs have delayed or cancelled preparatory activities they were planning to undertake as part of such programs. This has diminished the number of consulting opportunities that we could compete on globally, at least in the near-term. Furthermore, nuclear fuel fabrication and the use of new nuclear fuels in reactors must be licensed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and equivalent governmental authorities around the world. In many countries, the licensing process includes public hearings in which opponents of the use of nuclear power might be able to cause the issuance of required licenses to be delayed or denied.\nWe may not be able to receive or retain authorizations that may be required for us to sell our services or license our technology internationally.\nThe sales and marketing of our services and technology internationally may be subject to US and France export control regulations and the export control laws of other countries. Governmental authorizations may be required before we can export our services or technology. If authorizations are required and not granted, our international business plans could be materially affected. The export authorization process is often time consuming. Violation of export control regulations could subject us to fines and other penalties, such as losing the ability to export for a period of years, which would limit our revenue growth opportunities and significantly hinder our attempts to expand our business internationally.\nOur fuel designs have never been tested in an existing commercial reactor and actual fuel performance, as well as the willingness of commercial reactor operators and fuel fabricators to adopt a new design, is uncertain.\nNuclear power research and development entails significant technological risk. New designs must undergo extensive development and testing necessary for regulatory approval. Our fuel designs are still in the research and development stage and while certain testing on our fuel technologies has been completed, further testing and experiments will be required in test facilities. For example, our proposed metallic fuel uses a helical cruciform form to increase its surface area and shorten the distance for heat generated in the fuel rod to reach water and improve the coolability of the fuel. However, this proposed shape may also result in non-uniform distribution of azimuthal heat flux that may have an adverse impact on the critical heat flux and limit power uprate capabilities of our metallic fuel resulting from an increased surface area of the cruciform fuel rod compared to a conventional cylindrical fuel rod. Additional testing and development may result in changes to the design of our proposed metallic fuel, which could decrease its realizable benefits and impair the ability of nuclear utilities to utilize nuclear fuel incorporating our technology.\nFurthermore, the fuel technology has yet to be demonstrated in operating conditions equivalent to those found in an existing commercial reactor. Until we are able to successfully demonstrate operation of our fuel designs in commercial reactor conditions, we cannot confirm the ability of our fuel to perform as expected, including its ability to enable a power uprate or a longer operating cycle. In addition, there is also a risk that suitable testing or manufacturing facilities may not be available to us on a timely basis or at a reasonable cost, which could cause development program schedule delays.\nIf our fuel designs do not perform as anticipated in commercial reactor conditions, we will not realize revenues from licensing or other use of our fuel designs.\nThe amount of time and funding needed to bring our nuclear fuel to market may greatly exceed our projections.\nThe development of our nuclear fuel will take a significant amount of time and funding, and any delay in procuring equipment or in achieving development milestones, regulatory licensing timelines uncertainty could result in significant delays and cost overruns. We have come to the point where certain manufacturing equipment and a manufacturing facility are necessary for the development of our fuel; however, we cannot at this stage accurately predict the amount of funding or the time required to successfully manufacture and sell our fuel in the future. The actual cost and time required to commercialize our fuel technology may vary significantly depending on, among other things, the results of our research and product development efforts; the cost of developing or licensing our fuel; changes in the focus and direction of our research and product development programs; competitive and technological advances; the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing claims with respect to patents; the regulatory approval process; fuel manufacturing process; and marketing and other costs associated with commercialization of these technologies. Because of this uncertainty, even if financing is available to us, we may need significantly more capital than anticipated, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all, and the expected revenues and other benefits from our nuclear fuel technology may be delayed or never realized.\nOur current economic model for selling our fuel may prove to be inaccurate and our nuclear fuel technology products may not be cost effective.\nAlthough our economic model concludes that our fuel technology can provide a significant payback to utilities, it is based upon a number of assumptions that may not prove accurate. If such model is inaccurate, our nuclear fuel product may not provide nuclear utility customers with sufficient economic incentive to switch from existing nuclear fuels, and we would lose or fail to develop customers.\nDevelopment of our nuclear fuel technology is dependent upon the availability of a test reactor.\nOur fuel designs are still in the research and development stage and further testing and experiments will be required in test facilities. We intended to conduct further testing of our fuel designs at the Halden research reactor located in Halden, Norway. However, the Halden research reactor, which became operative in 1958, has closed and will not reopen, so it will not be available for further testing of our fuel designs. The Company has identified alternative options to generate the irradiation data we need to support regulatory licensing of our lead test assembly operation in a commercial reactor but pursuing such alternatives to the Halden research reactor may delay further testing of our fuel designs. We may not be able to contractually secure another reactor in which to test our fuel designs. As a result, commercialization of our nuclear fuel technology may be delayed, perhaps indefinitely, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential competitors could limit opportunities to license our technology.\nOther companies may develop new nuclear fuel designs that can be used in the same types of reactors as those that we target. Some of these companies have existing long-term commercial contracts with nuclear power utilities that we do not have. If another company were to successfully develop a new nuclear fuel that competes with our nuclear fuel design technology, opportunities to commercialize our technology would be limited, and our business would suffer.\nMoreover, many of these other companies have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than we do. These larger companies may be better able to handle the corresponding long-term financial requirements to successfully develop new nuclear fuel and bring it to market.\nWe serve the nuclear power industry, which is highly regulated. Our fuel designs differ from fuels currently licensed and used by commercial nuclear power plants. The regulatory licensing and approval process for nuclear power plants to use our fuels may be delayed and made more costly, and industry acceptance of our fuels may be hampered.\nThe nuclear power industry is a highly regulated industry. All entities that operate nuclear facilities and transport nuclear materials are subject to the jurisdiction of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or its counterparts around the world.\nOur fuel designs differ significantly in some aspects from the fuel used today by commercial nuclear power plants. These differences will likely result in more prolonged and extensive review by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its counterparts around the world that could cause development program schedule delays. Entities within the nuclear industry may be hesitant to be the first to use our fuel, which has little or no history of successful commercial use. Furthermore, our fuel development timeline relies on the relevant nuclear regulator to accept and approve technical information and documentation about our fuel that is generated during the research and development program. There is a risk that regulators may require additional information regarding the fuel\u2019s behavior or performance that necessitates additional, unplanned analytical and/or experimental work which could cause program schedule delays and require more research and development funding.\nExisting commercial nuclear infrastructure in many countries is limited to uranium material in an oxide form with enrichments up to 5%. Our fuel is in metallic form and is enriched to higher levels which would require modifications to existing commercial nuclear infrastructure and could impede commercialization of our technology.\nExisting commercial nuclear infrastructure, including conversion facilities, enrichment facilities, fabrication facilities, fuel storage facilities, fuel handling procedures, fuel operation at reactor sites, used fuel storage facilities and shipping containers, were designed and are currently licensed to handle uranium in oxide form with enrichment up to 5%. Our fuel designs are expected to use uranium metal with uranium enrichment levels up to 19.75% and would therefore require certain modifications to existing commercial nuclear infrastructure to enable commercial nuclear facilities to handle our fuels. Those nuclear facilities will need to go through a regulatory licensing process and obtain regulatory approvals to be able to process, handle, or ship uranium metal with enrichment levels up to 19.75% and operate commercial reactors using our metallic fuel. There is a risk that some relevant entities within the nuclear power industry may be slow in making any required facility infrastructure modifications or obtaining required licenses or approvals to enable enrichment to 19.75%, conversion to metallic uranium, fabrication of metallic fuel rods and assemblies, shipment of fresh and irradiated metallic fuel assemblies, interim storage of fresh and irradiated fuel assemblies in spent fuel pools or dry cask storage facilities at reactor sites, and permanent disposal of spent metallic fuel at a high-level repository. There is also a risk associated with possible negative perception of uranium enrichment greater than 5% that could potentially delay or hinder regulatory approval of our nuclear fuel designs.\nOur nuclear fuel designs rely on fabrication technologies that in certain material ways are different from the fabrication techniques presently utilized by existing commercial fuel fabricators. In particular, our metallic fuel rods must be produced using a co-extrusion fabrication process. Presently, most commercial nuclear fuel is produced using a pellet fabrication technology, whereby uranium oxide is packed into small pellets that are stacked and sealed inside metallic tubes. Our co-extrusion fabrication technology involves extrusion of a single-piece solid fuel rod from a metallic matrix containing uranium and zirconium alloy. Fabrication of full-length (approximately 3.5 to 4.5 meters) PWR metallic fuel rods has yet to be demonstrated. There is a risk that the fuel fabrication process utilized to produce one meter long metallic fuel rods may not be adaptable to the fabrication of full-length metallic fuel rods used in commercial reactors.\nIf the US Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) were to successfully assert that an invention claimed within our 2007 or 2008 Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent applications was first conceived or actually reduced to practice under a contract with the DOE, then our intellectual property rights in that invention could become compromised and our business model could become significantly impeded.\nWork on finite aspects and/or testing of some subject matter disclosed in our 2007 and 2008 Russian PCT patent applications was done under a government contract with the DOE. If the DOE asserted that an invention claimed in the 2007 and/or 2008 Russian PCT applications was first conceived or actually reduced to practice under such a contract, and a US court agreed, the DOE could gain an ownership interest in such an invention outside of the Russian Federation and our intellectual property rights in that claimed invention could become compromised and our business model may then be significantly impeded.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights and trade secrets relating to our technology, the commercial value of our technology may be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to obtain protection in the United States and other countries for our nuclear fuel designs by establishing and maintaining intellectual property rights relating to or incorporated into our fuel technologies and products. We own a variety of patents and patent applications in the United States, as well as corresponding patents and patent applications in several other jurisdictions. We have not obtained patent protection in each market in which we plan to compete. We do not know how successful we would be should we choose to assert our patents against suspected infringers. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Even if issued, patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection we may have for our products. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe intend to apply for additional patents for our nuclear fuel technologies and fuel, as we deem appropriate. We may, however, fail to apply for patents on important technologies or products in a timely fashion, if at all. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. In addition, in general the patent positions of energy technology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. As a result, the validity and enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted with certainty.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology, especially where it is believed that patent protection is undesirable for the Company or unobtainable. We generally require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to execute appropriate agreements with us recently regarding the safeguarding of confidential information. If any of these agreements are violated, or if any of our employees, consultants, advisors or collaborators unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors, we may not be able to fully perfect our rights to the technologies in question, and in some instances, we may not have an appropriate remedy available for the damages that we may incur as a result of any such violation. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. In addition, non-US courts are sometimes less willing than US courts to protect trade secrets. If our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, we would not be able to assert our trade secrets against them and our business could be harmed.\nIf we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur nuclear fuel designs may infringe, or be claimed to infringe, patents or patent applications under which we do not hold licenses or other rights. Third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the United States and elsewhere. Third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay commercialization of the fuel design or a component thereof that is the subject of the suit. As a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party and be required to pay license fees, royalties, or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other types of patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our nuclear fuel designs. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nApplicable Russian intellectual property law may be inadequate to protect some of our intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIntellectual property rights are evolving in Russia, and are trending towards international norms, but are by no means fully developed. We have worked closely with employees in Russia and other Russian contractors and entities to develop some of our material intellectual property. Some of our earlier intellectual property rights originate from our patent filings in Russia. Our worldwide rights in some of this intellectual property, therefore, may be affected by Russian intellectual property laws. If the application of Russian laws to some of our intellectual property rights proves inadequate, then we may not be able to fully avail ourselves of all of our intellectual property, and our business model may be impeded.\nThe laws of certain foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant challenges in protecting and defending such rights in such foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nOur nuclear fuel process is dependent on outside suppliers of nuclear and other materials and any difficulty by a fuel fabricator in obtaining these materials could be detrimental to our ability to eventually market our fuel through a fuel fabricator.\nProduction of fuel assemblies using our nuclear fuel designs is dependent on the ability of fuel fabricators to obtain supplies of nuclear material utilized in our fuel assembly design. Our proposed fuel products require high-assay low enriched uranium in the metallic form, enriched between 5% to 19.75% (HALEU), with presently no commercial supply of HALEU available in the US. Currently HALEU can only be sourced in limited quantities from the DOE.\nRecently, major commercial enrichment companies, such as Urenco facilities have expressed interest in supplying HALEU. Several Urenco enrichment facilities are already licensed to produce at enrichments above 5% U235, in line with today\u2019s nuclear industry market requirements. Urenco is now exploring the construction of a dedicated HALEU unit at the Urenco USA facility. Urenco is progressing the design engineering and related licensing activities to support this project.\nFabricators will also need to obtain metal for components, particularly zirconium or its alloys. These materials are regulated and can be difficult to obtain or may have unfavorable pricing terms. Any difficulties in obtaining these materials by fuel fabricators could have a material adverse effect on their ability to market fuel based on our technology.\nWe are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.\nWe retain highly confidential information in our systems and databases on third party network providers. Although we maintain security features in our systems designed to protect proprietary information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, such measures cannot provide absolute security and our operations may be susceptible to breaches on our third party networks, including from circumvention of security systems, denial of service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, technical malfunction, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches, system disruptions or other disruptions. We outsource certain functions, including IT functions, and these relationships allow for the storage and processing of our information, as well as customer, counterparty and employee information. While we engage in actions to reduce our exposure resulting from outsourcing, ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss, exposure or destruction of data, or other cybersecurity incidents, with increased costs and other consequences, including those described below.\nDisruptions from cybersecurity events may jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our systems or the systems of outsourcing parties. An increasing number of websites, including those owned by several other large Internet and offline companies, have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Certain efforts may be state sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources and therefore may be even more difficult to detect. We may not anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. We currently expend, and may be required to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to compensate us for any related losses we incur.\nThese issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand our operations. Any breach of our security measures, or even a perceived breach of our security measures, could cause us to lose potential customers and governmental approvals; suffer material harm to our business, financial condition, operating results and reputation; or be subject to regulatory actions, litigation, sanctions or other statutory penalties.\nTechnological changes could render our technology and products uncompetitive or obsolete, which could prevent us from achieving market share and sales.\nOur failure to refine or advance our fuel technologies could cause our nuclear fuel to become uncompetitive or obsolete, which could prevent us from achieving market share and sales. We may need to invest significant financial resources in research and product development to keep pace with technological advances in the industry and to compete in the future; we may be unable to secure such financing. We believe that a variety of competing alternative technologies may be in development by other companies that could result in lower manufacturing costs and/or higher fuel performance than those expected for our fuel products. Our development efforts may be rendered obsolete by the technological advances of others, and other technologies may prove more advantageous for commercialization.\nRisks related to the ownership of our common stock\nWe have issued preferred stock with rights senior to our common stock.\nApproximately 3.5 million shares of our Series A and Series B preferred stock were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2018. We can issue additional shares of preferred stock in one or more series and can set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from the holders of our common stock. Any preferred stock that we issue may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation premiums, may have greater voting rights than our common stock, and may have consent rights over certain fundamental transactions. The interests of the holders of the preferred stock may as a consequence be different from the interests of the holders of our common stock, including in certain fundamental transactions in which the preferred stockholders would receive distributions before any distributions may be made to our common stockholders. In addition, such preferred stock may contain provisions allowing it to be converted into shares of common stock, which could dilute the value of our common stock to then current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThere may be volatility in our stock price, which could negatively affect investments, and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the value they originally purchased such shares.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 trading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 failure to obtain or maintain analyst coverage of our common stock, changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, or our failure to achieve analyst earnings estimates;\n\u00b7 future sales of our common stock or other securities by us or our stockholders;\n\u00b7 general market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors; and\n\u00b7 the risks discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe stock market may experience extreme volatility that is often unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of its performance.\nOur inability to comply with the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market will result in our common stock being delisted, which could affect its market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital.\nWe have received notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) that we are not in compliance with certain requirements for continued listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. On November 5, 2018, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications staff notifying us that for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, our common stock did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). If we are not able to regain compliance with such requirements within the timeframe set by Nasdaq, or if we otherwise fail to comply with continued listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until May 6, 2019, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing. In order to regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. In the event we do not regain compliance by May 6, 2019, we may be provided an additional 180-day compliance period, if we demonstrate that we meet the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable standards for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and provides written notice of our intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the second grace period, including by implementation of a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nIf we fail to regain compliance with, or otherwise fail to comply with, all applicable continued requirements, Nasdaq may determine to delist our common stock, which could substantially decrease trading in our common stock and adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, our ability to raise additional capital, including through future at-the-market offerings and other offerings utilizing short-form registration statements on Form S-3, would be substantially impaired.", "PERMNO": 93083, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "LTBR"}
