You should carefully consider the following risk factors and uncertainties together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in Part II Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d If any of the following risks materializes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline significantly. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we are unable to increase the volume of OVA1 sales, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced significant operating losses each year since our inception and we expect to incur a net loss for fiscal year 2016 and the foreseeable future. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative costs.\nHistorically, all of our revenues were generated from sales of OVA1 tests performed by Quest Diagnostics. Pursuant to our March 2015 agreement with Quest Diagnostics, OVA1 testing in the United States for Quest Diagnostics customers was transitioned from Quest Diagnostics to ASPiRA LABS as of August 10, 2015, with the exception of a nominal number of OVA1 tests distributed through Quest Diagnostics after that date. We do not expect that Quest Diagnostics will distribute additional tests in the future. If we are unable to increase the volume of OVA1 sales, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nIn the past, a significant amount of our revenue was derived from Quest Diagnostics, and as testing services have recently been transitioned to ASPiRA LABS, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully market our test through additional channels, including ASPiRA LABS, in the future.\nVirtually all of our revenue during 2014 was derived through our strategic partnership with Quest Diagnostics and in 2015, Quest Diagnostics largely transitioned OVA1 testing services for its customers to ASPiRA LABS. Prior to the transition, revenue generated from Quest Diagnostics was based on the number of OVA1 tests performed by Quest Diagnostics and the reimbursement rate received by Quest Diagnostics for those tests. We continue to depend on Quest Diagnostics for blood draw and logistics for a significant portion of our specimens. There is no guarantee that Quest Diagnostics will perform as expected, or provide a sufficient volume of OVA1 test samples to support our business. Due in part to this uncertainty, we plan to offer OVA1 through additional channels in the future, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. In addition, as a result of the transition of OVA1 testing services from Quest Diagnostics to ASPiRA LABS, we have assumed responsibility for obtaining payment from third-party payers, whereas prior to the transition, Quest Diagnostics performed that task. Quest Diagnostics has more bargaining power with third-party payers than we do, and as a result, we may not be able to achieve reimbursement rates that are as high as those received by Quest Diagnostics. If we are not successful in adding additional sales channels or if we do not experience growing OVA1 test volumes or receive less reimbursement per test than expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailures by third-party payers to reimburse OVA1 or changes or variances in reimbursement rates could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVirtually all of our product revenue in 2014 was dependent on the amount Quest Diagnostics received from third-party payers for performing OVA1 tests. In 2015, Quest Diagnostics largely transitioned OVA1 testing services for its customers to ASPiRA LABS. As a result of the transition, we have assumed responsibility for obtaining payment from third-party payers, whereas prior to the transition, Quest Diagnostics performed that task. Accordingly, our future revenues will be dependent upon third-party reimbursement payments to ASPiRA LABS. Insurance coverage and reimbursement rates for diagnostic tests are uncertain, subject to change and particularly volatile during the early stages of commercialization. There remain questions as to what extent third-party payers, like Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies will provide coverage for OVA1 and for which indications. CMS is in the process of developing payment codes and reimbursement rates under Medicare for certain next generation sequencing tests which may include certain Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses, such as our OVA1 test. There is no guarantee that CMS will issue the codes and rates, that the codes will continue to cover the OVA1 test or that the payment rate will be comparable to current Medicare reimbursement levels for the test. Such uncertainty could create payment uncertainty from other payers as well. The reimbursement rates for OVA1 are largely out of our control. We have experienced volatility in the coverage and reimbursement of OVA1 due to contract negotiation with third-party payers and implementation requirements and that the reimbursement amounts we have received from third-party payers varies from payer to payer, and, in some cases, the variation is material.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThird-party payers, including private insurance companies as well as government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. These measures have resulted in reduced payment rates and decreased utilization of diagnostic tests such as OVA1. From time to time, Congress has considered and implemented changes to the Medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation, and pricing for tests covered by Medicare is subject to change at any time. Reductions in third-party payer reimbursement rates may occur in the future. Reductions in the price at which OVA1 is reimbursed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for OVA1 or if third-party payers change their coverage or reimbursement policies with respect to OVA1, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in the future and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us, we may be unable to execute our business plan.\nWe may seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities in the public or private markets, or through a collaborative arrangement or sale of assets. Additional financing opportunities may not be available to us, or if available, may not be on favorable terms. The availability of financing opportunities will depend, in part, on market conditions, and the outlook for our business. Any future issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders, and the securities issued in such a financing may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may not be able to continue our sales and marketing, research and development or other operations on the scope or scale of our current activity.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to commercialize Overa both within and outside the United States, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully.\nWe submitted our 510(k) clearance application for Overa, our second-generation biomarker panel, to the FDA in March 2015. We received FDA clearance for Overa on March 18, 2016 with the goal of commencing the marketing and sale of the panel in 2016. Overa is intended to maintain our product\u2019s high sensitivity while improving specificity. Though we plan to leverage off our existing infrastructure for OVA1, including ASPiRA Labs, there can be no assurance that we will be successfully able to commercialize Overa in the United States, or that we will be able to obtain reimbursement for Overa from third-party payers at the same rate as OVA1. If we are unable to successfully commercialize Overa, the results of our operations could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, in 2014 and 2015, all of our product revenue was generated in the United States. In 2015, we began to actively seek laboratory customers and other distributors and partners outside the United States, so that we may begin directly or indirectly marketing and selling Overa outside the United States in 2016. We may not be able to find suitable customers or other distributors or partners outside the United States that are willing to enter into business relationships with us on terms that are advantageous to us or at all. Moreover, while we registered the CE mark and in October 2015 obtained clearance to market Overa in the European Union, we may be prohibited in the future from directly or indirectly marketing or selling Overa in the European Union or various other jurisdictions outside the United States if we are unable to obtain applicable regulatory approvals. In addition, we will need to ensure that third-party payers, including insurance companies and government payers, in jurisdictions outside the United States will pay or reimburse for Overa tests performed in those jurisdictions.\nIf we are able to establish operations in countries outside of the United States, we may be subject to political, economic and other conditions affecting these countries that could result in increased operating expenses and regulation.\nIf we are able to execute on our plan to establish a market for Overa outside the United States, there are risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including the following:\n\u00b7\ndata privacy laws that may apply to the transmission of any clients\u2019 and employees\u2019 data to the United States;\n\u00b7\nimport/export sanctions and restrictions;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with applicable anti-corruption laws;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in managing international distributors;\n\u00b7\naccounting, tax and legal complexities arising from international operations;\n\u00b7\npotential difficulties in transferring funds generated overseas to the United States in a tax efficient manner; and\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability, including recent recessionary trends.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf we are able to establish operations in countries outside of the United States, changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our revenue and net income.\nIf we are able to successfully commercialize Overa outside the United States, we expect that revenue and expense from our foreign operations will typically be denominated in local currencies, thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates. Revenue and profit generated by any international operations will increase or decrease as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Adverse changes to foreign exchange rates could decrease the value of revenue we receive from our contemplated international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to continue to develop our existing technologies, we may not be able to successfully foster adoption of our products and services.\nOur technologies are new and complex, and are subject to change as new discoveries are made. New discoveries and advancements in the diagnostic field are essential if we are to foster the adoption of our product offerings. Development of our existing technologies remains a substantial risk to us due to various factors, including the scientific challenges involved, our ability to find and collaborate successfully with others working in the diagnostic field, and competing technologies, which may prove more successful than our technologies.\nWe may not succeed in developing additional diagnostic products, and, even if we do succeed in developing additional diagnostic products, the diagnostic products may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to develop and commercialize diagnostic products. There is considerable risk in developing diagnostic products based on our biomarker discovery efforts, as candidate biomarkers may fail to validate results in larger clinical studies or may not achieve acceptable levels of clinical accuracy. For example, markers being evaluated for one or more next-generation ovarian cancer diagnostic tests may not be validated in downstream pre-clinical or clinical studies, once we undertake and perform such studies. In addition, development of products combining biomarkers with imaging, patient risk factors or other risk indicators carry higher than average risks due to technical, clinical and regulatory uncertainties. While we have published proof of concept on combining OVA1 and imaging, for example, our ability to develop, verify and validate an algorithm that generalizes to routine testing populations cannot be guaranteed. If successful, the regulatory pathway and clearance/approval process may require extensive discussion with applicable authorities and possibly, medical panels or other oversight mechanisms. These pose considerable risk in projecting launch dates, requirements for clinical evidence and eventual pricing and return on investment. Although we are engaging important stakeholders representing gynecologic oncology, benign gynecology, patient advocacy, women\u2019s health research, reimbursement and others, success, timelines and value will be uncertain and require active management at all stages of innovation and development.\nClinical testing is expensive, takes many years to complete and can have an uncertain outcome. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of the testing. Clinical trials for our next generation ovarian cancer tests, and other future diagnostic tests, may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or non-clinical testing on these tests. In addition, the results of our clinical trials may identify unexpected risks relative to safety or efficacy, which could complicate, delay or halt clinical trials, or result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nIf we do succeed in developing additional diagnostic tests with acceptable performance characteristics, we may not succeed in achieving commercial market acceptance for those tests. Our ability to successfully commercialize diagnostic products, including OVA1 and Overa, will depend on many factors, including:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour ability to convince the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of our products and their advantages over existing diagnostic products;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour success in establishing new clinical practices or changing previous ones, such that utilization of the tests fail to meet established standards of care, medical guidelines and the like;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nour ability to develop business relationships with diagnostic or laboratory companies that can assist in the commercialization of these products in the U.S. and globally; and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u2022\nthe scope and extent of the agreement by Medicare and third-party payers to provide full or partial reimbursement coverage for our products, which will affect patients\u2019 willingness to pay for our products and will likely heavily influence physicians\u2019 decisions to recommend or use our products.\nThese factors present obstacles to commercial acceptance of our existing and potential diagnostic products, for which we will have to spend substantial time and financial resources to overcome, and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. Our inability to do so successfully would prevent us from generating revenue from OVA1, Overa and future diagnostic products.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe diagnostics market is competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully, which would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue.\nOur principal competition currently comes from the many clinical options available to medical personnel involved in clinical decision making. For example, rather than ordering an OVA1 test for a woman with an adnexal mass, obstetricians, gynecologists, and gynecologic oncologists may choose a different clinical option or none at all. If we are not able to convince clinicians that OVA1 provides significant improvement over current clinical practices, our ability to commercialize OVA1 will be adversely affected. Additionally, in September 2011, Fujirebio Diagnostics received FDA clearance for its ROMA test. ROMA combines two tumor markers and menopausal status into a numerical score using a publicly available algorithm. This test has the same intended use and precautions as OVA1, and our revenues could be materially and adversely affected if the ROMA test is successfully commercialized. In addition, competitors, such as Becton Dickinson, ArrayIt Corporation, and Abbott Laboratories have publicly disclosed that they have been or are currently working on ovarian cancer diagnostic assays. Academic institutions periodically report new findings in ovarian cancer diagnostics that may have commercial value. Our failure to compete with any competitive diagnostic assay if and when commercialized could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have priced OVA1 at a point that recognizes the value-added by its increased sensitivity for ovarian malignancy. If others develop a test that is viewed to be similar to OVA1 in efficacy but is priced at a lower point, we and/or our strategic partners may have to lower the price of OVA1 in order to effectively compete, which would impact our margins and potential for profitability.\nOur diagnostic tests are subject to ongoing regulation by the FDA; the commercialization of our diagnostic tests may be adversely affected by changing FDA regulations; and any delay by or failure of the FDA to approve our diagnostic tests submitted to the FDA may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe FDA cleared OVA1 in September 2009. In connection with the clearance of OVA1 we agreed to conduct certain post-market surveillance studies to further analyze performance of OVA1 in pre- and post-menopausal women. Failure to comply with our post-marketing study requirements may lead to enforcement actions by the FDA, including seizure of our product, injunction, prosecution and/or civil money penalties, which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur activities related to diagnostic products are, or have the potential to be, subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of our products. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, civil money penalties, injunctions and criminal prosecution.\nThe Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requires that medical devices introduced to the United States market, unless exempted by regulation, be the subject of either a pre-market notification clearance, known as a 510(k) clearance or 510(k) de novo clearance, or a pre-market approval (\u201cPMA\u201d). Some of our potential future clinical products may require a 510(k) or 510(k) de novo clearance, while others may require a PMA. With respect to devices reviewed through the 510(k) process, we may not market a device until an order is issued by the FDA finding our product to be substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device known as a predicate device. A 510(k) submission may involve the presentation of a substantial volume of data, including clinical data. The FDA may agree that the product is substantially equivalent to a predicate device and allow the product to be marketed in the United States. On the other hand, the FDA may determine that the device is not substantially equivalent and require a PMA or a de novo 510(k), or require further information, such as additional test data, including data from clinical studies, before it is able to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. By requesting additional information, the FDA can delay market introduction of our products. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive any necessary 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, or the imposition of stringent restrictions on the labeling and sales of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If the FDA indicates that a PMA is required for any of our potential future clinical products, the application will require extensive clinical studies, manufacturing information and likely review by a panel of experts outside the FDA. Clinical studies to support either a 510(k) submission or a PMA application would need to be conducted in accordance with FDA requirements. Failure to comply with FDA requirements could result in the FDA\u2019s refusal to accept the data or the imposition of regulatory sanctions. We cannot assure that any necessary 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. To the extent we seek FDA 510(k) clearance or FDA pre-market approval for other diagnostic tests, any delay by or failure of the FDA to clear or approve those diagnostic tests may adversely affect our consolidated revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with FDA requirements for production, marketing and post-market monitoring of our products, we may not be able to market our products and services and may be subject to stringent penalties, product restrictions or recall; further improvements to our manufacturing operations may be required that could entail additional costs.\nThe commercialization of our products could be delayed, halted or prevented by applicable FDA regulations. If the FDA were to view any of our actions as non-compliant, it could initiate enforcement actions, such as a warning letter and possible imposition of penalties. For instance, we are subject to a number of FDA requirements, including compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRegulations \u201cQSR\u201d requirements, which establish extensive requirements for quality assurance and control as well as manufacturing procedures. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in enforcement actions for us or our potential suppliers. Adverse FDA actions in any of these areas could significantly increase our expenses and reduce our revenue. We will need to undertake steps to maintain our operations in line with the FDA\u2019s QSR requirements. Some components of OVA1 and Overa are manufactured by other companies and we are required to ensure that, to the extent that we incorporate those components into our finished OVA1 or Overa test, we use those components in compliance with QSR. Any failure to do so would have an adverse effect on our ability to commercialize OVA1 or Overa. Our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities, since they manufacture finished kits that we use in OVA1 and Overa, are subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory agencies. Our facility also is subject to FDA inspection. We or our suppliers may not satisfy such regulatory requirements, and any such failure to do so may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our suppliers fail to produce acceptable or sufficient stock, make changes to the design or labeling of their biomarker kits or discontinue production of existing biomarker kits or instrument platforms, we may be unable to meet market demand for OVA1.\nThe commercialization of our OVA1 and Overa tests depend on the supply of five different immunoassay kits from third-party manufacturers run on automated instruments. Failure by any of these manufacturers to produce kits that pass Vermillion\u2019s quality control measures might lead to back-order and/or loss of revenue due to missed sales and customer dissatisfaction. In addition, if the design or labeling of any kit were to change, continued OVA1 or Overa supply could be threatened since new validation and submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance could be required as a condition of sale. Discontinuation of any of these kits would require identification, validation and 510(k) submission on a revised OVA1 or Overa design. Likewise, discontinuation or failure to support or service the instruments may pose risk to ongoing operations.\nEffective December 2014, one of the five immunoassay component kits that are used in OVA1 ceased to be supported on the instrument as the manufacturer transitioned to a newer platform. While we have not experienced and do not anticipate disruption of ongoing operations, failure of the manufacturer to provide extended service or support might harm our business. Overa consolidates the five OVA1 immunoassays onto a single mainstream automated platform and substitutes a new immunoassay component kit for the discontinuing kit as a mitigating action. Although we received a 510(k) clearance from the FDA for Overa on March 18, 2016, there can be no assurances that there will not be future disruptions in our supply chain. Any resulting disruption to our supply of OVA1 or Overa would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain our rights to utilize intellectual property directed to diagnostic biomarkers, we may not be able to offer diagnostic tests using those biomarkers.\nOne aspect of our business plan is to develop diagnostic tests based on certain biomarkers, which we have the right to utilize through licenses with our academic collaborators, such as Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. In some cases, our collaborators own the entire right to the biomarkers. In other cases, we co-own the biomarkers with our collaborators. If, for some reason, we lose our license to biomarkers owned entirely by our collaborators, we may not be able to use those biomarkers in diagnostic tests. If we lose our exclusive license to biomarkers co-owned by us and our collaborators, our collaborators may license their share of the intellectual property to a third party that may compete with us in offering diagnostic tests, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf a third party infringes on our proprietary rights, we may lose any competitive advantage we may have as a result of diversion of our time, enforcement costs and the loss of the exclusivity of our proprietary rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain and enforce our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets to protect our technology and brand. We have submitted a number of patent applications covering biomarkers that may have diagnostic or therapeutic utility. Our patent applications may or may not result in additional patents being issued.\nIf third parties engage in activities that infringe on our proprietary rights, we may incur significant costs in asserting our rights, and the attention of our management may be diverted from our business. We may not be successful in asserting our proprietary rights, which could result in our patents being held invalid or a court holding that the competitor is not infringing, either of which may harm our competitive position. We cannot be sure that competitors will not design around our patented technology.\nWe also rely upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our technical personnel. To help protect our rights, we require all employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, knowledge or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. If any trade secret, knowledge or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf others successfully assert their proprietary rights against us, we may be precluded from making and selling our products or we may be required to obtain licenses to use their technology.\nOur success depends on avoiding infringing on the proprietary technologies of others. If a third party were to assert claims that we are violating its patents, we might incur substantial costs defending ourselves in lawsuits against charges of patent infringement or other unlawful use of another\u2019s proprietary technology. Any such lawsuit may involve considerable management and financial resources and may not be decided in our favor. If we are found liable, we may be subject to monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting us from using the technology. We may also be required to obtain licenses under patents owned by third parties and such licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nFuture litigation against us could be costly and time consuming to defend.\nWe are from time to time subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by current or former employees, and claims brought by third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. In addition, we may bring claims against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights. Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert our attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn unfavorable judgment against us in any legal proceeding or claim could require us to pay monetary damages. In addition, an unfavorable judgment in which the counterparty is awarded equitable relief, such as an injunction, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur diagnostic efforts may cause us to have significant product liability exposure.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical diagnostic tests entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. Potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy. We will need to increase our amount of insurance coverage in the future if we are successful at introducing new diagnostic products, and this will increase our costs. If we are held liable for a claim or for damages exceeding the limit of our insurance coverage, we may be required to make substantial payments. This may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our business is highly dependent on key executives and employees, our inability to recruit and retain these people could hinder our business plans.\nWe are highly dependent on our executive officers and certain key employees. Our executive officers and key employees are employed at will by us. Any inability to engage new executive officers or key employees could impact operations or delay or curtail our research, development and commercialization objectives. To continue our research and product development efforts, we need people skilled in areas such as clinical operations, regulatory affairs and clinical diagnostics. Competition for qualified employees is intense.\nIf we lose the services of any executive officers or key employees, our ability to achieve our business objectives could be harmed, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur operations, as well as those of the collaborators on which we depend, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire; natural disasters, including earthquakes; computer viruses; human error; power shortages; telecommunication failures; international acts of terror; and similar events. Although we have certain business continuity plans in place, we have not established a formal comprehensive disaster recovery plan, and our back-up operations and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses we may suffer. A significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations.\nLegislative actions resulting in higher compliance costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and new regulations adopted by the SEC, are resulting in increased compliance costs. We, like all other public companies, are incurring expenses and diverting employees\u2019 time in an effort to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndisclosure obligations. Compliance with these evolving standards will result in increased general and administrative expenses and may cause a diversion of our time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nChanges in healthcare policy could increase our costs and impact sales of and reimbursement for our tests.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cPPACA\u201d) requires each medical device manufacturer to pay a sales tax in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices. The PPACA also mandated a reduction in payments of 1.75% for the years 2011 through 2015 for clinical laboratory services paid under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. This adjustment was in addition to a productivity adjustment to the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which halted certain reductions in payment mandated by the PPACA as well as certain CMS policies, will instead establish a market-based reimbursement system for clinical laboratories beginning in 2017 and require reporting of certain private payer reimbursement data by laboratories as early as 2016. CMS also issued various regulations and guidance generally effective in 2014 that limited reimbursement for clinical laboratory tests as a general matter, but permitted the continued ability for CMS to pay for Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses in certain circumstances. In addition to these changes, a number of states are also contemplating significant reform of their healthcare policies. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. The taxes imposed by the PPACA have resulted in decreased profits to us and lower reimbursements by payers for our tests. Other changes to healthcare laws may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including the handling and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes, the recycling and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment, and emissions and discharges into the environment. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs to remediate hazardous substances or petroleum products on or from its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties affected by such contamination. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such substances could adversely affect the value and the ability to transfer or encumber such property.\nThe success of ASPiRA LABS depends, in part, on our ability to generate sufficient demand for its services to cover the laboratory\u2019s operating costs, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully.\nThe launch of our new clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS, involved significant costs to us, including the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities, outside consulting fees for branding and other services and other general and administrative expenses. We expect to continue to incur significant costs to operate ASPiRA LABS in the future, such as salaries and related expenses for personnel, regulatory compliance costs and ongoing costs of outsourced billing services. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate a sufficient volume of patients to access the laboratory and utilize its offerings to cover the fixed and ongoing costs of ASPiRA LABS.\nThere is no guarantee that we be able to generate sufficient revenue in the future to offset our costs. Our inability to successfully develop sufficient demand for the diagnostic tests processed by the laboratory could delay or prevent ASPiRA LABS from generating revenue in excess of expenses, and we may not achieve profitability from ASPiRA LABS in the foreseeable future, if at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability, we may be unable to continue our ASPiRA LABS operations or we may be unable to expand our offerings at ASPiRA LABS beyond ovarian cancer to other gynecologic conditions with high unmet need as we intend.\nThe operation of ASPiRA LABS requires us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, which is expensive and time-consuming and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and any failure to comply could result in exposure to substantial penalties and other harm to our business.\nIn June 2014, we launched a clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS. Clinical laboratories that perform tests on human subjects in the United States for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease must be certified under CLIA and licensed under applicable state laboratory laws. CLIA regulates the quality of clinical laboratory testing by requiring laboratories to comply with various technical, operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate, reliable and timely. State laws may require that additional quality standards be met and that detailed review of scientific validations and technical procedures for tests occur.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nASPiRA LABS holds a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation and a state laboratory license in California, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. This allows the lab to process OVA1 on a national basis. We are subject to periodic surveys and inspections to maintain our CLIA certification, and such certification is also required to obtain payment from Medicare, Medicaid and certain other third-party payers. Failure to comply with CLIA or state law requirements may result in the imposition of corrective action or the suspension or revocation of our CLIA certification or state licenses. If our CLIA certification or state licenses are suspended or revoked or our right to bill the Medicare and Medicaid programs or other third-party payers is suspended, we would no longer be able to sell our tests, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that ASPiRA LABS\u2019 suppliers or commercial partners will remain in compliance with applicable CLIA and other federal or state regulatory requirements for laboratory operations and testing. ASPiRA LABS\u2019 facilities and procedures and those of ASPiRA LABS\u2019 suppliers and commercial partners are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by regulatory and other government authorities. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of ASPiRA LABS\u2019 products, and criminal prosecution.\nOur clinical laboratory business is also subject to regulation at both the federal and state level in the United States, as well as regulation in other jurisdictions outside of the United States, including:\n\u2022 Medicare and Medicaid coverage, coding and payment regulations applicable to clinical laboratories;\n\u2022 the Federal Anti Kickback Statute and state anti-kickback prohibitions;\n\u2022 the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, and state self-referral prohibitions;\n\u2022 the Medicare civil monetary penalty and exclusion requirements;\n\u2022 the Federal False Claims Act civil and criminal penalties and state equivalents; and\n\u2022 the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) as amended by the\nHealth Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (\u201cHITECH\u201d);\nMany of these laws and regulations prohibit a laboratory from making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests (by physicians or others) that are billed to Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal or state healthcare programs. The penalties for violation of these laws and regulations may include monetary fines, criminal and civil penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Several states have similar laws that may apply even in the absence of government payers. HIPAA and HITECH and similar state laws seek to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, and penalties for violations of these laws may include required reporting of breaches, monetary fines and criminal or civil penalties.\nWhile we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and develop compliance policies to address risk as appropriate, many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by governmental authorities or the courts. These laws or regulations also could in the future be interpreted or applied by governmental authorities or the courts in a manner that could require us to change our operations.\nAny action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations (including actions brought by private qui tam \u201cwhistleblower\u201d plaintiffs), even if successfully defended, could divert management\u2019s attention from our business, damage our reputation, limit our ability to provide services, decrease demand for our services and cause us to incur significant expenses for legal fees and damages. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, recoupment of funds received by us, exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business. We also could potentially incur additional liabilities from third-party claims. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the future, we plan to develop and perform LDTs at ASPiRA LABS. If the FDA finalizes its October 2014 draft guidance documents that outline the FDA\u2019s proposal to actively regulate LDTs, we may need to obtain a 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval for our future LDTs, and there is no guarantee that we would ever procure the needed FDA clearance or approval. We also would need to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements.\nWe intend to develop and perform LDTs at ASPiRA LABS in the future. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion and not required approvals or clearances for LDTs. However, in October 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents, entitled \u201cFramework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)\u201d and \u201cFDA Notification and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMedical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs),\u201d respectively, that set forth a proposed risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs.\nAccording to the draft guidance documents, all laboratories with LDTs-except for those only performing forensic testing or certain LDTs for transplantation-would need to comply with some basic statutory requirements, regardless of the risks of the tests, including adverse event reporting, corrections and removals reporting and registration and listing or notification.\nIn addition, \u201chigh\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d risk tests not subject to an exemption will need to be the subject of a PMA or 510(k) submitted to the FDA in a phased-in manner. High-risk tests are those that are classified as Class III devices. Within those high-risk devices, the FDA identifies the \u201chighest risk devices\u201d as (1) LDTs with the same intended use as an approved or cleared companion diagnostic; (2) LDTs with the same intended use as an FDA-approved Class III device; and (3) certain LDTs for determining safety and effectiveness of blood or blood products. Moderate-risk tests are those that are classified as Class II devices. The FDA has indicated that it does not intend to modify its policy of enforcement discretion until the draft guidance documents are finalized. It is unclear at this time when, or if, the draft guidance documents will be finalized, and, if so, how the final framework might differ from the proposal. In addition, the new regulatory requirements are proposed to be phased in consistent with the schedule set forth in the guidance documents for tests that are on the market at the time the guidance documents are finalized.\nLegislative proposals addressing the FDA\u2019s oversight of LDTs have been previously introduced, and we expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time to time. The likelihood that Congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the FDA\u2019s plans to regulate LDTs as medical devices is difficult to predict.\nEven before the FDA finalizes such guidance documents, the FDA may assert that a test that we believe to be an LDT is not an LDT and could require us to seek clearance or approval to offer such tests for clinical use. If the FDA pre-market review or approval is required for any of the future LDTs we may develop, we may be forced to stop selling our tests or be required to modify claims or make such other changes while we work to obtain FDA clearance or approval. Our business, results of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected until such review is completed and clearance to market or approval is obtained.\nIf pre-market review is required by the FDA or if we decide to voluntarily pursue FDA pre-market review of our future LDTs, there can be no assurance that any tests we develop in the future will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all. Obtaining FDA clearance or approval for diagnostics can be expensive, time consuming and uncertain, and for higher-risk devices generally takes several years and requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data. In addition, medical devices are subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations for those tests would increase the cost of conducting our business and subject us to heightened regulation by the FDA and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nThe liquidity and trading volume of our common stock may be low, and our ownership is concentrated.\nThe liquidity and trading volume of our common stock has at times been low in the past and may again be low in the future. If the liquidity and trading volume of our common stock is low, this could adversely impact the trading price of our shares, our ability to issue stock and our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain liquidity in their shares. The issuance of common stock by us in May 2013 and subsequent warrant exercise in December 2013, and the issuance of common stock by us in December 2014 and July 2015 involved a significant issuance of stock to a limited number of investors, significantly increasing the concentration of our share ownership in a few holders.\nAccording to information provided on Schedules 13D, 13F and 13G as recent as December 31, 2015, five persons beneficially owned approximately 62% of our outstanding shares of common stock, and under a May 2013 stockholders agreement, two of these persons have certain rights to designate a director to be nominated by us to serve on the Board of Directors. As a result, these stockholders will be able to affect the outcome of, or exert significant influence over, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any change in control. In particular, this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us. This, in turn, could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. It could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership also contributes to the low trading volume and volatility of our common stock.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nfailure to significantly increase revenue and volumes of OVA1 or Overa;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated period-to-period fluctuations in financial results;\n\u00b7\nfailure to achieve, or changes in, financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nannouncements or introductions of new products or services or technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\npublicity regarding actual or potential discoveries of biomarkers by others;\n\u00b7\ncomments or opinions by securities analysts or stockholders;\n\u00b7\nconditions or trends in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology or life science industries;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us of significant acquisitions and divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments regarding our patents or other intellectual property or that of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nlitigation or threat of litigation;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nlimited daily trading volume;\n\u00b7\neconomic and other external factors, disasters or crises; and\n\u00b7\nour announcement of additional fundraisings.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for diagnostic technology companies, in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of our attention and our resources.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter, bylaws, other agreements and under Delaware law could make a third-party acquisition of the Company difficult.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us, even if a change of control might be deemed beneficial to our stockholders. Such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our securities. Our certificate of incorporation eliminates the right of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders or to act by written consent without a meeting, and our bylaws require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations, which may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before an annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at an annual meeting of stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock. In addition, the likelihood that the holders of preferred stock will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control.\nIn connection with our private placement offering of common stock and warrants on May 13, 2013, we entered into a stockholders agreement which, among other things, includes agreements limiting our ability to effect a change in control without the consent of at least one of the two primary investors in that offering. These and other provisions may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of us. The amendment of any of the provisions of either our certificate of incorporation or bylaws described in the preceding paragraph would require not only approval by our board of directors and the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of our then outstanding voting securities, but also the consent of at least one of the two primary investors in the May 2013 offering. We are also subject to certain provisions of Delaware law that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company. These provisions could make a third-party acquisition of the Company difficult and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe could face adverse consequences as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\nCertain of our stockholders may, from time to time, attempt to aggressively involve themselves in the governance and strategic direction of our Company above and apart from normal interactions between stockholders and management. Such activism, and any related negative publicity, could result in substantial costs that negatively impact our stock price and increase its volatility. In addition, such activism could cause a diversion of the attention of our management and Board of Directors and create perceived uncertainties with existing and potential strategic partners impacting our ability to consummate potential transactions, collaborations or opportunities in furtherance of our strategic plan. In addition, such activism could make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, customers and business partners, which could disrupt the growth of the market for OVA1 or Overa, delay the development\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nand commercialization of new tests and further adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and increase its volatility. In addition, the activists may have little or no experience in the diagnostics industry or may seek to elect members to our Board of Directors with little or no experience in the diagnostics industry who may have a specific agenda different and apart from the majority of our stockholders.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, our stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased their shares.\nWe may need to sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities in the future to meet our capital requirements, which could cause significant dilution.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, grants and government funding and strategic alliances. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt, such financing may be dilutive to stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and potential dilution to stockholders. Furthermore, a perception that future sales of our common stock in the public market are likely to occur could affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 52,113,059 shares of our common stock outstanding and 3,371,505 shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance to employees, directors and consultants pursuant to our employee stock plans, which excludes 3,317,811 shares of our common stock that were subject to outstanding options. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, warrants to purchase 4,587,000 shares of our common stock were outstanding. These warrants are exercisable at the election of the holders thereof at an average exercise price of $1.96 per share.\nThe exercise of all or a portion of our outstanding options and warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 88620, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "AWH"}
