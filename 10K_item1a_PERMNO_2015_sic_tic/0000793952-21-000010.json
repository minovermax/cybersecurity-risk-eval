{"cik": "793952", "company": "HARLEY-DAVIDSON, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in Harley-Davidson, Inc. involves risks, including those discussed below. These risk factors should be considered carefully before deciding whether to invest in the Company.\nOperational Risks\n\u2022The Company\u2019s operations have been and may continue to be disrupted to varying degrees due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 and the subsequent actions taken to mitigate the spread impacted the Company's operations and ability to carry out its business as usual. The Company closed facilities, including temporarily suspending its global manufacturing starting in March 2020 through May 2020. At the end of April 2020, nearly sixty percent of the Company's global dealer network was temporarily closed due to various federal, state and local government actions that were implemented to attempt to mitigate the public health crisis. The Company\u2019s worldwide retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were down significantly versus the prior year due to the temporary dealer closures. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the Company\u2019s supply chain, including shortages and shipment delays; limited the ability of the Company\u2019s distributors and independent dealers to operate; caused some retail customers to delay their purchase decisions; adversely impacted the ability of the Company\u2019s retail credit customers to meet their loan obligations on a timely basis and made collection efforts more difficult; disrupted global capital markets impacting the Company\u2019s access to capital, cost of capital, and overall liquidity levels; delayed the Company\u2019s new product development efforts; and resulted in the cancellation or adjustments to the scope of riding and similar events that are important to the Company\u2019s marketing efforts. While many of actions implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have been rolled back in certain markets, the continued spread of COVID-19, and the efforts to avoid that, could do the following, each of which could be material: (i) result in further disruptions of the Company\u2019s supply chain; (ii) again limit the ability of the Company\u2019s distributors and independent dealers to operate, which could impact their ability to purchase and sell the Company\u2019s products and meet their loan obligations to the Company; (iii) continue to cause some retail customers to delay their purchase decisions, which could cause a decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s product; (iv) continue to adversely impact the ability of the Company\u2019s retail credit customers to meet their loan obligations on a timely basis and make collection efforts more difficult; (v) result in further disruption of global capital markets; (vi) continue to delay the Company\u2019s new product development efforts; and (vii) cause other unpredictable events.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s ability to remain competitive is dependent upon its capability to develop and successfully introduce new, innovative and compliant products. The motorcycle market continues to change in terms of styling preferences and advances in new technologies, and at the same time, it is subject to increasing regulations related to safety and emissions. The Company must continue to distinguish its products from its competitors\u2019 products with unique styling and new technologies that consumers desire. Introducing new models may not lead to the desired result of driving unit sales growth. As the Company incorporates new and different features and technology into its products, the Company must protect its intellectual property from imitators and ensure its products do not infringe the intellectual property of other companies. In addition, these new products must comply with applicable regulations worldwide and satisfy the potential demand for products that produce lower emissions and achieve better fuel economy. The Company must make product advancements to respond to changing consumer preferences and market demands. The Company must also be able to design and manufacture these products and deliver them to a global marketplace in an efficient and timely manner and at prices that are attractive to customers. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in these endeavors or that existing and prospective customers will like or want the Company\u2019s new products.\n\u2022Increased supply of and/or declining prices for used motorcycles and excess supply of new motorcycles may adversely impact retail sales of new motorcycles by the Company\u2019s independent dealers. The Company has observed that when the supply of used motorcycles increases or the prices for used Harley-Davidson motorcycles decline, there can be reduced demand among retail purchasers for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles (at or near manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail prices). Further, the Company and its independent dealers can and do take actions that influence the markets for new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. For example, introduction of new motorcycle models with significantly different functionality, technology or other customer satisfiers can result in increased supply of used motorcycles, which could result in declining prices for used motorcycles and prior model-year new motorcycles. Also, while the Company is operating with a remodeled approach to supply and inventory management, that approach may not be effective, or the Company\u2019s competitors could choose to supply new motorcycles to the market in excess of demand at reduced prices, which could also have the effect of reducing demand for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles (at or near manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail prices). Ultimately, reduced demand among retail purchasers for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles leads to reduced shipments by the Company.\n\u2022The motorcycle industry has become increasingly competitive. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors are more diversified than the Company, and they may compete in all segments of the motorcycle market, other powersports markets and/or the automotive market. Also, the Company\u2019s manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price for its motorcycles is generally higher than its competitors, and as price becomes a more important factor for consumers in the markets in which the Company competes, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, many competitors headquartered outside the U.S. experience a financial benefit from a strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to their home currency that can enable them to reduce prices to U.S. consumers. The Company is also subject to policies and actions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Many major competitors of the Company are not subject to the requirements of the SEC or the NYSE rules. As a result, the Company may be required to disclose certain information that may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage to its principal competitors. In addition, the Company\u2019s financial services operations face competition from various banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions that may have access to additional sources of capital at more competitive rates and terms, particularly for borrowers in higher credit tiers. The Company's responses to these competitive pressures, or its failure to adequately address and respond to these competitive pressures, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022The Company must prevent and detect issues with its products, components purchased from suppliers and its suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes to reduce recall campaigns, warranty costs, litigation, product liability claims, delays in new model launches and regulatory investigations. The Company must also complete any recall campaigns within cost expectations. The Company must continually improve and adhere to product development and manufacturing processes and ensure that its suppliers and their sub-tier suppliers adhere to product development and manufacturing processes, to ensure high quality products are sold to retail customers. If product designs or manufacturing processes are defective, the Company could experience delays in new model launches, field actions such as product programs and product recalls, inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies, and warranty claims and product liability claims, which may involve purported class actions. While the Company uses reasonable methods to estimate the cost of warranty, recall and product liabilities and appropriately reflects those in its financial statements, there is a risk the actual costs could exceed estimates and result in damages that are not covered by insurance. Further, selling products with quality issues, the announcement of recalls and the filing of product liability claims (whether or not successful), may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and brand strength with a resulting adverse impact on sales of new products.\n\u2022A cybersecurity breach may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, revenue and earnings. The Company and certain of its third-party service providers and vendors receive, store and transmit digital personal information in connection with the Company\u2019s human resources operations, financial services operations, e-commerce, the Harley Owners Group, independent dealer management, mobile applications and other aspects of its business. The Company\u2019s information systems, and those of its third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties have attempted to and may attempt in the future to gain access to these systems or the information the Company and its third-party service providers and vendors maintain and use through fraud or other means of deceiving the Company's employees and third-party service providers and vendors. Hardware, software or applications the Company develops or obtains from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security and/or the Company\u2019s operations. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect. The Company has implemented and regularly reviews and updates processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean the Company and third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. The Company has experienced information security attacks, but to date they have not materially compromised the Company\u2019s computing environment or resulted in a material impact on the Company\u2019s business or operations or the release of confidential information about its employees, customers, dealers, suppliers or other third parties. Any future significant compromise or breach of the Company\u2019s data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, employee, dealer, supplier or Company data could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s operations, significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits and/or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous with new and evolving requirements, compliance could also result in the Company being required to incur additional costs.\n\u2022The Company relies on third-party suppliers to obtain raw materials and provide component parts for use in the manufacture of its motorcycles. The Company may experience supply problems relating to raw materials and\ncomponents such as unfavorable pricing, poor quality or untimely delivery. In certain circumstances, the Company relies on a single supplier to provide the entire requirement of a specific part, and a change in this established supply relationship may cause disruption in the Company\u2019s production schedule. In addition, the price and availability of raw materials and component parts from suppliers can be adversely affected by factors outside of the Company\u2019s control such as the supply of a necessary raw material, natural disasters or widespread infectious disease like COVID-19. Further, the Company's suppliers may experience difficulty in funding their day-to-day cash flow needs because of tightening credit caused by financial market disruption. In addition, adverse economic conditions and related pressure on select suppliers due to difficulties in the global manufacturing arena could adversely affect their ability to supply the Company. Changes in laws and policies relating to trade and taxation may also adversely impact the Company's foreign suppliers. These supplier risks may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022The Company primarily sells its products at wholesale and must rely to a large extent on a network of independent dealers and distributors to manage the retail distribution of its products. The Company depends on the capability of its distributors and independent dealers to develop and implement effective retail sales plans to create demand among retail purchasers for the motorcycles and related products and services that the dealers purchase from the Company. If the Company\u2019s distributors and independent dealers are not successful in these endeavors, or do not appropriately adapt to the evolving retail landscape, then the Company will be unable to maintain or grow its revenues and meet its financial expectations. Further, distributors and independent dealers may experience difficulty in funding their day-to-day cash flow needs and paying their obligations resulting from adverse business conditions, such as weakened retail sales and tightened credit. If distributors and independent dealers are unsuccessful, they may exit or be forced to exit the business or, in some cases, the Company may seek to terminate relationships with certain distributors and independent dealerships. As a result, the Company could face additional adverse consequences related to the termination of distributor and independent dealer relationships. Additionally, liquidating a former distributor or independent dealer\u2019s inventory of new and used motorcycles can add downward pressure on new and used motorcycle prices. Further, the unplanned loss of any of the Company\u2019s distributors or independent dealers may lead to inadequate market coverage for retail sales of new motorcycles and for servicing previously sold motorcycles, create negative impressions of the Company with its retail customers, and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to collect wholesale receivables that are associated with that independent dealer.\n\u2022Weather may impact retail sales by the Company's independent dealers. The Company has observed that abnormally cold and/or wet conditions in a region, including impacts from hurricanes or unusual storms, could have the effect of reducing demand or changing the timing for purchases of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Reduced demand for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles ultimately leads to reduced shipments by the Company.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s Motorcycles segment is dependent upon unionized labor. A substantial portion of the hourly production employees working in the Motorcycles segment are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company is currently a party to three collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the United Steelworkers of America. Current collective bargaining agreements with hourly employees in Wisconsin will expire in 2024, and the agreement with employees in Pennsylvania will expire in 2022. There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in negotiating new agreements with these unions that extend beyond the current expiration dates or that these new agreements will be on terms that will allow the Company to be competitive. The Company's decisions regarding opening, closing, expanding, contracting or restructuring its facilities may require changes to existing or new bargaining agreements. Failure to renew agreements when they expire or to establish new collective bargaining agreements on terms acceptable to the Company and the unions could result in the relocation of production facilities, work stoppages or other labor disruptions which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022The Company incurs substantial costs with respect to employee pension and healthcare benefits. The Company\u2019s cash funding requirements and its estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and healthcare benefits for both active and retired employees are based on several factors that are outside the Company\u2019s control. These factors include funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the rate used to discount the future estimated liabilities, the rate of return on plan assets, current and projected healthcare costs, healthcare reform or legislation, retirement age and mortality. Changes in these factors can impact the expense, liabilities and cash requirements associated with these benefits which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations, liquidity or shareholders\u2019 equity. In addition, costs associated with these benefits put the Company under significant cost pressure as compared to its competitors that may not bear the costs of similar benefit plans.\n\u2022The Company relies on third parties to perform certain operating and administrative functions for the Company. Similar to suppliers of raw materials and components, the Company may experience problems with outsourced services, such as unfavorable pricing, untimely delivery of services, or poor quality. Also, these suppliers may experience adverse economic conditions due to difficulties in the global economy that could lead to difficulties supporting the Company's operations. In light of the amount and types of functions that the Company has outsourced, these service provider risks may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\nStrategic Risks\n\u2022The Company may not be able to successfully execute its short-term and long-term business plans and strategies. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to execute its business plans and strategies, including the Company\u2019s recently announced strategic plan, The Hardwire. The Company\u2019s ability to meet the strategic priorities in The Hardwire depends upon, among other factors, the Company\u2019s ability to: (i) realize expectations concerning market demand for electric, middleweight, and small-displacement models, which may depend in part on the building of necessary infrastructure for electric models, (ii) develop and introduce products on a timely basis that the market accepts, that enable the Company to generate desired sales levels and that provide the desired financial returns, (iii) successfully carry out its global manufacturing and assembly operations, (iv) effectively implement changes relating to its dealers and distribution methods, (v) accurately analyze, predict and react to changing market conditions, (vi) perform in a manner that enables the Company to benefit from market opportunities while competing against existing and new competitors, and (vii) avoid adverse impacts to its operations and/or demand for its products that may result due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022International sales and operations subject the Company to risks that may have a material adverse effect on its business. While the Company has narrowed its geographic reach on an international basis, international operations and sales remain an important part of the Company\u2019s strategy. There is no assurance that the Company will succeed with its new approach to international markets which includes focusing on high potential markets, and exiting or reducing its presence in remaining markets. Further, international operations and sales are subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers, the impact of foreign government laws and regulations and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to international operations, the effects of income and withholding taxes, governmental expropriation and differences in business practices. The Company may incur increased costs and experience delays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international operations and sales that could cause loss of revenues and earnings. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory and business climate could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s net sales, financial condition, profitability and cash flows. Business practices that may be accepted in other countries can violate U.S. or other laws that apply to the Company. Violations of laws that apply to the Company's foreign operations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt the Company's business and result in an adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business and results of operations.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s success depends upon the continued strength of the Harley-Davidson brand. The Company believes that the Harley-Davidson brand has significantly contributed to the success of its business and that maintaining and enhancing the brand is critical to expanding its customer base. Failure to protect the brand from infringers or to grow the value of the Harley-Davidson brand may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\u2022The timing of a launch of a premium low displacement motorcycle for the China market is uncertain. The Company has identified China as a priority geographic market, and its objectives include launching a premium low displacement motorcycle for the China market. In 2019, the Company announced a collaboration with Zhejiang Qianjiang Motorcycle Co., Ltd. to support the launch of a smaller, more accessible Harley-Davidson motorcycle planned for the China market in 2020. To date, the Company has not launched a premium low displacement motorcycle through this collaboration. If this collaboration is not productive, although the Company believes it could collaborate with others, there is no assurance that would be the case. If the Company is not able to launch a premium low displacement motorcycle for the China market, that would adversely affect its growth plans for China.\n\u2022The Company continues to explore and consider the details related to its electric motorcycle strategy and its ultimate approach may expose the Company to risks. The Company is focusing its electric strategy through a separate division with a dedicated leadership team. While the objective is to allow for greater flexibility in product development and in the creation of an innovative go-to-market strategy for its electric motorcycles, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to create a successful electric motorcycle strategy or successfully execute it.\nFinancial Risks\n\u2022The financial services operations are exposed to credit risk on its retail and wholesale finance receivables. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a failure by a customer, including the Company's independent dealers, to meet the terms of any contract with the Company\u2019s financial services operations. Credit losses are influenced by general business and economic conditions, including unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings and other factors that negatively affect household incomes, as well as contract terms and customer credit profiles. Credit losses are also influenced by the markets for new and used motorcycles, and the Company and its independent dealers can and do take actions that impact those markets. For example, the introduction of new models by the Company that represent significant upgrades on previous models may result in increased supply or decreased demand in the market for used Harley-Davidson branded motorcycles, including those motorcycles that serve as collateral or security for credit that HDFS has extended. This in turn could adversely impact the prices at which repossessed motorcycles may be sold, which may lead to increased credit losses for HDFS. Negative changes in general business, economic or market factors may have an additional adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial services credit losses and future earnings. The Company believes HDFS' retail credit losses may continue to increase over time due to changing consumer credit behavior, HDFS' efforts to increase prudently structured loan approvals to sub-prime borrowers, and new financing programs that may result in different loan performance than our existing programs.\n\u2022The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The Company sells its products globally and in most markets outside the U.S. those sales are made in the foreign country\u2019s local currency. As a result, a weakening in those foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can adversely affect the Company's revenue and margin, and cause volatility in its results of operations. Furthermore, many competitors headquartered outside the U.S. experience a financial benefit from a strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to their home currency that can enable them to reduce prices to U.S. consumers. The Company is also subject to risks associated with changes in prices of commodities. Earnings from the Company\u2019s financial services business are affected by changes in interest rates. Although the Company uses derivative financial instruments to some extent attempt to manage a portion of its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rate risks, the Company does not attempt to manage its entire expected exposure, and these derivative financial instruments generally do not extend beyond one year and may expose the Company to credit risk in the event of counterparty default to the derivative financial instruments. There can be no assurance that in the future the Company will successfully manage these risks.\n\u2022The financial services operations are highly dependent on accessing capital markets to fund operations at competitive interest rates, the Company\u2019s access to capital and its cost of capital are highly dependent upon its credit ratings, and any negative credit rating actions will adversely affect its earnings and results of operations. Liquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s financial services business. Disruptions in financial markets may cause lenders and institutional investors to reduce or cease to loan money to borrowers, including financial institutions. The Company\u2019s financial services operations may be negatively affected by difficulty in raising capital in the long-term and short-term capital markets. These negative consequences may in turn adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations in various ways, including through higher costs of capital and reduced funds available through its financial services operations to provide loans to independent dealers and their retail customers. Additionally, the ability of the Company and its financial services operations to access unsecured capital markets is influenced by their short-term and long-term credit ratings. If the Company\u2019s credit ratings are downgraded or its ratings outlook is negatively changed, then the Company\u2019s cost of borrowing could increase, which may result in reduced earnings and reduced interest margins, and the Company\u2019s access to capital may be disrupted or impaired.\nLegal, Regulatory & Compliance Risks\n\u2022Changes in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, their enforcement and downstream consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and outlook. Tariffs and/or other developments with respect to trade policies, trade agreements and government regulations could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Without limitation, (i) tariffs currently in place, (ii) the imposition by the U.S. government of new tariffs on imports to the U.S. and/or (iii) the imposition by foreign countries of tariffs on U.S. products could materially increase: (a) the cost of Harley-Davidson products that the Company is offering for sale in relevant countries, (b) the cost of certain products that the Company sources from foreign manufacturers and (c) the prices of certain raw materials that the Company utilizes. The Company may not be able to pass such increased costs on to distributors, independent dealers or their customers, and the Company may not be able to secure sources of certain products and materials that are not subject to tariffs on a timely basis. Such developments could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. As an example, in 2018, the European Union (EU) placed an\nincremental tariff on motorcycles imported into the EU from the U.S., which is scheduled to increase effective June 1, 2021. In addition, the U.S. government imposed increased tariffs on imports from China (Section 301 tariffs), which has resulted in higher costs for components and products sourced from China. The ongoing impact of these tariffs will depend on future trade discussions between the U.S. and China or the Company\u2019s ability to avoid or offset these costs should the tariffs remain in place.\n\u2022The Company must comply with governmental laws and regulations that are subject to change and involve significant costs. The Company\u2019s sales and operations in areas outside the U.S. may be subject to foreign laws, regulations and the legal systems of foreign courts or tribunals. These laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies may result in increased costs or restrictions on the ability of the Company to sell its products in certain countries. U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation may also adversely affect the Company's international sales operations.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. sales and operations are subject to governmental policies and regulatory actions of agencies of the United States Government, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), SEC, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. Department of Labor and Federal Trade Commission. In addition, the Company\u2019s sales and operations are also subject to laws and actions of state legislatures and other local regulators, including independent dealer statutes and licensing laws. Changes in regulations, changes in interpretations of regulations by governmental agencies, or the imposition of additional regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nTax - The Company is subject to income and non-income based taxes in the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's worldwide income tax liabilities and other tax liabilities including the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act). The Company believes that it complies with applicable tax laws. If the governing tax authorities have a different interpretation of the applicable laws or if there is a change in tax laws, the Company's financial condition and/or results of operations may be adversely affected. To the extent there are considerable changes to tax laws, the Company may need to readjust its tax strategy, and may not be able to take full advantage of such changes.\nEnvironmental - The majority of the Company\u2019s motorcycle products use internal combustion engines. These motorcycle products are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies, such as the California Air Resources Board and regulatory agencies in certain foreign countries where the Company\u2019s motorcycle products are sold. The Company is also subject to statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise in the conduct of the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations. Any significant change to the regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise may substantially increase the cost of manufacturing the Company\u2019s products. If the Company fails to meet existing or new requirements, then the Company may be unable to produce and sell certain products or may be subject to fines or penalties.\nFurther, in response to concerns about global climate changes and related changes in consumer preferences, the Company is likely to face greater regulatory and customer pressure to develop products that generate less emissions. This will require the Company to spend additional funds on research, product development and implementation costs, and subject the Company to the risk that the Company\u2019s competitors may respond to these pressures in a manner that gives them a competitive advantage.\nFinancial Services - The Company\u2019s financial services operations are governed by a wide range of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws that regulate financial and lending institutions, and financial services activities. In the U.S. for example, these laws include the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act. The financial services operations originate the majority of its consumer loans through its subsidiary, Eaglemark Savings Bank, a Nevada state thrift chartered as an Industrial Loan Company. U.S. federal and state bodies may in the future impose additional laws, regulation and supervision over the financial services industry.\nViolations of, or non-compliance with, relevant laws and regulations may limit the ability of HDFS to collect all or part of the principal or interest on applicable loans, may entitle the borrower to rescind the loan or obtain a refund of amounts previously paid, could subject HDFS to payment of damages, civil fines, or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions and could limit the number of loans eligible for HDFS securitizations programs. Such regulatory requirements and associated supervision also could limit the discretion of HDFS in operating its business, such as through the suspension or revocation of any charter, license or registration at issue, as well as the imposition of administrative sanctions, including \"cease and desist\" orders. The Company cannot assure that the applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed in ways that are adverse to HDFS, that new laws and regulations will\nnot be adopted in the future, or that laws and regulations will not attempt to limit the interest rates or convenience fees charged by HDFS, any of which may adversely affect the business of HDFS or its results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) is a sweeping piece of legislation impacting financial services and the full effect continues to evolve as regulations that are intended to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are adopted, and the text of the Dodd-Frank Act is analyzed by stakeholders and the courts. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the Bureau). The Bureau has significant enforcement and rule-making authority in the area of consumer financial products and services. The direction that the Bureau will take, the regulations it will adopt, and its interpretation of existing laws and regulations are all elements that are not yet fully known and subject to change. Compliance may be costly and could affect operating results as the implementation of new forms, processes, procedures and controls and infrastructure may be required. Compliance may create operational constraints and place limits on pricing. Failure to comply, as well as changes to laws and regulations, or the imposition of additional laws and regulations, could affect HDFS\u2019 earnings, limit its access to capital, limit the number of loans eligible for HDFS securitization programs and have a material adverse effect on HDFS\u2019 business and results of operations. The Bureau also has supervisory authority over certain non-bank larger participants in the vehicle financing market, which includes a non-bank subsidiary of HDFS, allowing the Bureau to conduct comprehensive and rigorous on-site examinations that could result in enforcement actions, fines, changes to processes and procedures, product-related changes or consumer refunds, or other actions.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations. Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress has previously considered and may in the future implement restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, several U.S. states, including states where the Company has manufacturing facilities, have previously considered and may in the future implement greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Energy security and availability and its related costs affect all aspects of the Company\u2019s manufacturing operations in the U.S., including the Company\u2019s supply chain. The Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and certain of the Company\u2019s facilities emit amounts of greenhouse gas that may be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity the Company purchases, increase costs for use of natural gas, potentially restrict access to or the use of natural gas, require the Company to purchase allowances to offset the Company\u2019s own emissions or result in an overall increase in costs of raw materials, any one of which could increase the Company\u2019s costs, reduce competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, operations or financial results. Many of the Company\u2019s suppliers face similar circumstances. Physical risks to the Company\u2019s business operations as identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other expert bodies include scenarios such as sea level rise, extreme weather conditions and resource shortages. Extreme weather may disrupt the production and supply of component parts or other items such as natural gas, a fuel necessary for the manufacture of motorcycles and their components. Supply disruptions would raise market rates and jeopardize the continuity of motorcycle production.\n\u2022Regulations related to materials that the Company purchases to use in its products could cause the Company to incur additional expenses and may have other adverse consequences. Laws or regulations impacting the Company's supply chain, such as the UK Modern Slavery Act, could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the raw materials that the Company uses in the manufacturing of its products. The Company's supply chain is complex, and if it is not able to fully understand its supply chain, then the Company may face reputational challenges with customers, investors or others and other adverse consequences. For example, many countries in which the Company distributes its products are introducing regulations that require knowledge and disclosure of virtually all materials and chemicals in the Company\u2019s products. Accordingly, the Company could incur significant costs related to the process of complying with these laws, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements.\nGeneral Risks\n\u2022Changes in general economic and business conditions, tightening of credit and retail markets, political events or other factors may adversely impact independent dealers\u2019 retail sales. The motorcycle industry is impacted by general economic conditions over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control. These factors can weaken the retail environment and lead to weaker demand for discretionary purchases such as motorcycles. Weakened economic conditions in certain business sectors and geographic areas can also result in reduced demand for the Company's products. Tightening of credit can limit the availability of funds from financial institutions and other lenders and sources of capital which could adversely affect the ability of retail consumers to obtain loans for the\npurchase of motorcycles from lenders, including HDFS. Should general economic conditions or motorcycle industry demand decline, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be substantially adversely affected. The motorcycle industry can also be affected by political conditions and other factors over which motorcycle manufacturers have little control.\n\u2022The Company is and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. The uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved claims and lawsuits may harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, reputation and brand. The defense of the lawsuits may result in the expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from business operations. In addition, although the Company is unable to determine the amount, if any, that it may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of the lawsuits by settlement or otherwise, any such payment may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.
