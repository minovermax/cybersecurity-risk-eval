{"cik": "1669812", "company": "LSC Communications, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows can be adversely affected by various risks. These risks include the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider all of these risks.\nRisks Relating to the Business of the Company\nOur management has concluded, and our independent registered public accounting firm has noted in their report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, that, due to our noncompliance of financial covenants under our Credit Agreement, substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. Based on final results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company concluded it was not in compliance with the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Ratio contained in the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019. The noncompliance occurred on the last day of the fourth quarter due to the following: the Company\u2019s Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeded the maximum level permitted and the Company\u2019s Minimum Interest Ratio was below the minimum level permitted. On March 2, 2020, the Company entered into a Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement with lenders constituting a majority under the Credit Agreement that governs the Company\u2019s Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility. The Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement waives the defaults or events of default that have occurred as a result of the noncompliance on December 31, 2019. The Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement also includes an undertaking from the lenders to forbear from exercising remedies for certain potential future defaults or events through the period ended May 14, 2020 (such period, the \u201cForbearance Period\u201d), subject to the Company\u2019s compliance with various undertakings in the Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement. The Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement contains certain covenants and requirements, and failure to comply with these covenants and requirements could result in the termination of the Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement prior to its stated term. Following the end of the Forbearance Period, the lenders may choose not to provide a full waiver of the Potential Defaults, should any occur. Unless the Company obtains an extension or another waiver, upon the termination of the Waiver, Forbearance Agreement and Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement, the Company\u2019s debt under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility could be in default and could be accelerated by lenders, which would require the Company to pay all amounts outstanding and could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other debt. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe degree to which our assets are leveraged and the terms of our debt could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital, as well as the terms at which such capital might be offered to us.\nThe ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company entering into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, including revised covenants, or obtaining financing to replace the current facility, as well as continuing profitable operations, continuing to meet its obligations, and continuing to repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. The Company has evaluated its plans to alleviate this doubt, which may include obtaining amended terms from its current lenders to allow for sufficient flexibility in the financial covenants after giving consideration to the Company\u2019s current operations and strategic plans, or evaluating strategic alternatives in order to reduce the Company\u2019s indebtedness. Negotiations with our lenders may require the Company to raise additional capital and/or pursue the sale of non-core assets to reduce existing debt. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its plans to refinance, to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms or to sell non-strategic assets, when required or if at all. If such plans are not realized, the Company may be forced to limit its business activities or be unable to continue as a going concern, which will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Management anticipates incurring certain one-time expenses, which may be significant, during 2020 relating to the plans it may pursue to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe highly competitive market for our products and industry fragmentation may continue to create adverse price pressures.\nThe markets for the majority of our product categories are highly fragmented and we have a large number of competitors. Management believes that excess capacity in our markets, as well as increasing consolidation of our customer base has caused downward price pressure for our products and that this trend is likely to continue. In addition, consolidation in the markets in which we compete may increase competitive price pressures due to competitors lowering prices as a result of synergies achieved or lower cost platforms.\nWe may be unable to improve our operating efficiency rapidly enough to meet market conditions.\nBecause the markets in which we compete are highly competitive, we must continue to improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our profitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. In addition, the need to reduce ongoing operating costs may result in significant up-front costs to reduce workforce, close or consolidate facilities, or upgrade equipment and technology, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nThe substitution of electronic delivery for printed materials and decrease in printed page counts may continue to adversely affect our businesses.\nElectronic delivery of documents and data, including the online distribution and hosting of media content, offer alternatives to traditional delivery of printed materials. Consumers continue to accept electronic substitution in directory printing and are replacing traditional reading of printed materials with online, hosted media content or e-reading devices. Additionally, customers may choose to decrease their printed page counts by using their printed product to drive customers to their websites. The extent to which consumers will continue to accept electronic delivery is uncertain and it is difficult to predict future rates of acceptance of these alternatives. Electronic delivery has negatively impacted some of our products, such as directories and books. Digital technologies have also impacted printed magazines, as advertising spending has continued to significantly transition from print to electronic media. To the extent that consumers and customers continue to accept these alternatives, our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nGlobal market and economic conditions, as well as the effects of these conditions on our customers\u2019 businesses, could adversely affect us, as the financial condition of our customers may deteriorate.\nGlobal economic conditions affect our customers\u2019 businesses and the markets they serve. Because a significant part of our business relies on advertising spending, which is driven in part by economic conditions and consumer spending, a prolonged downturn in the global economy and an uncertain economic outlook could further reduce the demand for the printing and related services that we provide. Delays or reductions in customers\u2019 spending would have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could be material, and consequently could negatively impact our results of consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows. Economic weakness and constrained advertising spending may result in decreased net sales, operating margins, earnings and growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collecting accounts receivable. Our exposure to industries experiencing financial difficulties and certain financially troubled customers could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows. Further, a lack of liquidity in the capital markets or a sustained period of unfavorable economic conditions could increase our exposure to credit risks of our customers and result in increases in bad debt write-offs and allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. We may experience operating margin declines, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive price pressures, inventory write-downs, cost increases for wages and materials, and increases in pension plan funding requirements. Economic downturns may also result in restructuring actions and associated expenses and impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. In addition, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019, resulting in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region. The impact of the coronavirus on our business is uncertain at this time and will depend on future developments, but prolonged closures in China may disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers, distributors and customers, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with seasonality, which could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nOur sales and cash flows are affected by seasonality, as print demand is affected by advertising and consumer spending trends. Historically, demand for printing of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books and office products is higher in the second half of the year, driven by increased advertising pages within magazines, holiday volume in catalogs and retail inserts, and back-to-school demand in books and office products. Specifically, the demand for trade books is stronger in the second half of the year due to the holiday season, while the market for educational books is stronger during this period due to the back-to-school season. These typical seasonal patterns can be impacted by overall trends in the U.S. and world economy. For these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons are not a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future.\nIncreases in commodity and other operating costs may adversely impact us.\nThe profitability of our Company depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including paper, ink, energy and other raw materials, and other operating costs, including labor and transportation. Any volatility in certain commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely affect our operating results by impacting our profitability. Increases in the prices of these inputs may increase our costs, and we may not be able to pass these increased costs on to customers through higher prices, or to the extent we pass along such costs by increasing our prices to our customers, it may adversely impact customers\u2019 demand for our printing and related services.\nDecreases in the market prices for waste paper or other byproducts may adversely impact us.\nDecreases in the prices paid by third parties for waste paper and other print-related byproducts may make it infeasible for us to sell, or adversely impact the amounts we are paid, from sales of such byproducts.\nWe may be adversely affected by a decline in the availability of raw materials.\nWe are dependent on the availability of paper, ink and other raw materials to support our operations. Unforeseen developments in these markets could result in a decrease in the supply of paper, ink or other raw materials and could cause us to be unable to meet contractual commitments to our customers or result in a decline in our net sales.\nWe rely on a key supplier for ink and a separate key supplier for paper. If such suppliers breach or are unable to perform certain obligations under our arrangement with them, we may be unable to procure comparable supply from another supplier in a timely fashion, or when we are able to procure such supply, such supply may be on worse terms.\nA significant portion of our ink comes from a single supplier pursuant to a multi-year supply agreement. The ink industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, as the demand for ink has declined while the costs of raw materials used to manufacture ink have fluctuated. We rely on this ink supplier to meet a significant portion of our ink needs, and have negotiated a contract that provides us with favorable terms and certain contingencies from supply disruption. Additionally, we entered into a paper consignment agreement at the end of 2019 with one supplier that will encompass substantially all LSC Communications\u2019 purchased paper by mid-2020.\nA disruption in the supply of ink or paper from these suppliers, either from natural disaster, financial bankruptcy or other supply interruption, may require us to purchase a significant amount of ink or paper from other suppliers or assume the production ourselves, which in either case, may be on worse terms and slow our production, either of which could have a negative impact on our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to more intensive competition if our competitors pursue consolidations.\nWe currently have a large number of competitors in the markets in which we operate. If our competitors are able to successfully combine with one another, and we are not successful with our own efforts to consolidate or adapt effectively to increased competition, the competitive landscape we face could be significantly altered. Such consolidation could create stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader manufacturing and distribution capabilities than our own, and the resulting increase in competitive pressures could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nOur business is dependent upon brand recognition and reputation, and the failure to maintain or enhance our brands or reputation would likely have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur brand recognition, particularly in our Office Products segment, and reputation generally are important aspects of our business. Maintaining and further enhancing our brands and reputation will be important to retaining and attracting customers for our products. We also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation for products will continue to increase as competition in the market for our products continues to increase. Our success in this area will be dependent on a wide range of factors, some of which are out of our control, including our ability to retain existing and obtain new customers and strategic partners, the quality and perceived value of our products, actions of our competitors, and positive or negative publicity. Our reputation also depends on the quality of our customer service, and if our customer service declines, our reputation may also decline. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nCatastrophic events may damage or destroy our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may disrupt our business.\nNatural disasters, conflicts, wars, terrorist attacks, fires or other catastrophic events could cause damage or disruption to our factories, distribution centers or other facilities, which may adversely affect our ability to manage logistics, cause delays in the delivery of products and services to our customers, and create inefficiencies in our supply chain. An event of this nature could also prevent us from maintaining ongoing operations and from performing critical business functions. While we maintain backup systems and operate out of multiple facilities to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, a catastrophic event that results in the destruction of any of our major factories, distribution centers or other facilities could affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nThere are risks associated with operations outside the United States.\nOur operations outside of the United States during the year ended December 31, 2019 were primarily in Mexico and Canada, which accounted for 6% of our 2019 consolidated net sales. As a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including the impact of economic and political instability of those countries in which we operate. Security disruptions within the regions in Mexico in which we operate may interfere with operations, which could negatively impact our supply chain.\nWe, particularly in the Office Products segment, are also subject to risks that could materially affect our operations and operating results with respect to potential changes in United States government trade policy and legislation, including changes to tax laws, withdrawal from or modification of certain international trade agreements, including the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d), the imposition of additional tariffs or other restrictions on trade on goods produced outside the United States for import into the United States and any changes in diplomatic relations with countries in which we operate or do business and compliance with applicable anti-corruption and sanctions laws and regulations.\nWe are exposed to risks related to potential adverse changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in the currency exchange rates of the currencies in the countries in which we do business. Although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the operating results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, fluctuations in such rates may affect the translation of these results into our consolidated financial statements. To the extent borrowings, sales, purchases, net sales and expenses or other transactions are not in the applicable local currency, we may enter into foreign currency spot and forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. Management cannot be sure, however, that our efforts at hedging will be successful, and such efforts could, in certain circumstances, lead to losses.\nThe trend of increasing costs to provide health care and other benefits to our employees may continue.\nWe provide health care and other benefits to our employees. For many years, costs for health care have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. If this trend in health care costs continues, our cost to provide such benefits could increase, adversely impacting our profitability. Changes to health care regulations in the U.S. may also increase our cost of providing such benefits. The full effect that a full or partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act or changes to other healthcare laws and regulations would have on our business remains unclear at this time, and could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nChanges in market conditions, changes in discount rates, or lower returns on assets may increase required pension plan contributions in future periods.\nThe funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain interest rates. As experienced in prior years, declines in the market value of the securities held by the plans coupled with historically low interest rates have substantially reduced, and in the future could further reduce, the funded status of the plans. These reductions may increase the level of expected required pension plan contributions in future years. Various conditions may lead to changes in the discount rates used to value the year-end benefit obligations of the plans, which could partially mitigate, or worsen, the effects of lower asset returns. If adverse conditions were to continue for an extended period of time, our costs and required cash contributions associated with pension plans may substantially increase in future periods.\nA decline in our expected profitability or the expected profitability of our individual reporting units could result in the impairment of assets, including goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets.\nWe hold goodwill, other long-lived assets and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. A decline in expected profitability, particularly if there is a decline in the global economy, could call into question the recoverability of our related goodwill, other long-lived tangible and intangible assets or deferred tax assets and require the write-down or write-off of these assets or, in the case of deferred tax assets, recognition of a valuation allowance through a charge to income. Such an occurrence has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nChanges in postal rates, regulations and delivery systems may adversely impact demand for our products and services.\nPostal costs are a significant component of many of our customer\u2019s cost structure. Postal rate changes and USPS regulations that result in higher overall costs can influence the volume that these clients will be willing to print and ultimately send through the USPS.\nCurrent federal law limits postal rate increases (outside of an \"exigent circumstance\") to the increase in the Consumer Price Index. This cap works to ensure funding stability and predictability for mailers. Under this current federal law, the USPS implemented a rate adjustment in early 2020 affecting all market dominant classes (periodicals, standard mail, first class mail, package services and special services), which was based on an average inflation-based rate increase for each class of mail.\nIn December 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released the White House Task Force report on the United States Postal System. The report provides a series of recommendations to overhaul the United States Postal Service\u2019s business model in order to return it to sustainability without shifting additional costs to taxpayers. The effects of this report on postal rates, regulations and delivery systems are not yet known.\nFederal law requires the Postal Regulatory Commission (\"PRC\") to conduct a periodic review of the overall rate-making structure for the USPS. The PRC filed order 5337 on December 5, 2019 to increase inflation-based pricing to include an additional 2% - 5% per year. The order was open for comment until February 3, 2020 and more information will be made available in the coming months. Until the final determination, mailers need to account for the possibility of a significant increase in their future postage expenses.\nThe result of such determination may be reduced demand for printed products, co-mail and freight services as our customers may move more aggressively into other delivery methods such as the many digital and mobile options now available to consumers, which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures, which could increase our costs and subject us to liabilities.\nThe conduct of our businesses is subject to various environmental laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local government agencies in the United States, as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of political, economic or social events. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and, therefore, may impact our results or increase our costs and liabilities.\nVarious laws and regulations addressing climate change are being considered at the federal and state levels. Proposals under consideration include limitations on the amount of greenhouse gas that can be emitted. Such proposals may have a negative impact on our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows if capital spend or increased resources are required for compliance.\nThe success and growth of our business may depend on our ability to continually invest in our infrastructure which can result in significant expenses.\nCapital expenditures, such as software upgrades or machinery replacements, may be necessary from time to time to preserve the competitiveness, success and growth of our business. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and is expected to remain competitive. We may be required to invest amounts in capital expenditures that exceed our recent spending levels to replace worn out or obsolete machinery or otherwise remain competitive. If cash from operations is insufficient to provide for needed levels of capital expenditures and we are unable to obtain funds for such purposes elsewhere, we may be unable to make necessary upgrades or repairs to our software and facilities. An increase in capital expenditures could affect our ability to compete effectively and could have a negative impact on our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nThe failure to adapt to technological changes to address the changing demands of customers or the failure to implement new required processes or procedures in connection with the expansion of our products and services into new areas may adversely impact our business.\nMany of the end markets in which our customers compete are experiencing changes due to technological progress and changes in consumer preferences. In order to remain competitive, we will need to continue to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address the changing demands of customers. If we are unable to continue to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods, our business may be adversely affected.\nTechnological developments, changing demands of customers and the expansion of our products and services into new areas may require additional investment in new equipment and technologies, as well as the implementation of additional necessary or required compliance procedures and processes to which we are not currently subject. The development of such solutions may be costly and there is no assurance that these solutions will be accepted by customers. Furthermore, our compliance with new procedures and processes may increase our costs and, in the event we are unable to comply, may reduce our customers\u2019 willingness to work with us. If we are unable to adapt to technological changes on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, or if we cannot comply with these necessary or required procedures or processes, customers\u2019 demand for our products and services may be adversely affected.\nOur services depend on the reliability of computer systems maintained by us and our vendors and the ability to implement and maintain information technology and security measures to protect against security breaches and data leakage.\nWe depend on our information technology and data processing systems to operate our business, and a significant malfunction or disruption in the operation of our systems, or a security breach or a data leak that compromises the confidential and sensitive information of ours and of our customers stored in those systems, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation with customers and adversely impact our ability to compete. These systems include systems that we own and operate, as well as those systems of our vendors.\nOur systems are integral to the operation of our business, because they allow us to share information that may be confidential in nature to our customers across our offices worldwide, which allows us to increase global reach for our customers, or they allow us to offer products that are dependent upon access to the systems. Such systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions due to equipment damage, power outages and a range of other hardware, software and network problems. Those systems are also susceptible to cybercrime, or threats of intentional disruption, which are increasing in terms of sophistication and frequency. Our systems are also susceptible to breaches due to intentional employee misconduct. For any of these reasons, we may experience systems malfunctions or interruptions or leakage of confidential information. A significant or large-scale malfunction or interruption of any one of our computer or data processing systems, or the leakage of confidential information due to a malfunction or breach of our systems or employee misconduct, could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently, and damage our reputation if we are unable to track transactions, deliver products and safeguard our customers\u2019 confidential information. A malfunction that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business could negatively impact our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nIn addition, we may from time to time acquire companies or businesses that do not have cybersecurity practices and procedures consistent with ours, and we may need to invest in bringing those businesses onto our existing systems or updating them to comply with ours. Such systems may be more vulnerable to attack or malfunction than our systems until such time as we are able to integrate the business.\nThe availability and cost to hire and retain talented employees, including skilled labor and management, may adversely impact us.\nOur success depends, in part, on our general ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain employees. The loss of a significant number of our employees or the inability to attract, hire, develop, train and retain personnel could have a serious negative effect on our business. Various locations may encounter competition with other manufacturers for skilled and unskilled labor. Many of these manufacturers may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices than we offer. We are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations affecting our workforce. These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Claims of non-compliance with these regulations could result in liability and expense to the Company.\nWe have in the past acquired and may intend in the future to acquire other businesses and we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of these businesses and may not achieve the cost savings and increased net sales anticipated as a result of these acquisitions.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend in part upon our ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. The integration of acquired businesses may also require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy is, in part, predicated on the Company\u2019s ability to realize cost savings and to increase net sales through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of the Company\u2019s products and services. Achieving these cost savings and net sales increases is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. In particular, the Company may not be able to realize the benefits of more comprehensive product and service offerings, anticipated integration of sales forces, asset rationalization and systems integration.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nDelaware law and anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents may discourage our acquisition by a third party, which could make it more difficult to acquire us and limit your ability to sell your shares at a premium.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that is opposed by our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series with such rights, obligations and preferences as the board of directors may determine, without further vote or action by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nadvanced notice procedures for stockholders to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors and for stockholders to submit proposals for consideration at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\ninability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting rights for our stockholders.\nWe are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a publicly-held Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock for a three-year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder. This statute, as well as the provisions in our organizational documents, could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing certain potential acquisitions or a change in control of us.\nAdverse credit market conditions may limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain future financing.\nWe may, from time to time, depend on access to the credit markets. Uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets may cause financial markets institutions to fail or may cause lenders to hoard capital and reduce lending. The failure of a financial institution that supports the Company\u2019s existing credit agreement would reduce the size of its committed facility unless a replacement institution were added.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness and the degree to which we are currently leveraged may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows.\nWe have $910 million of indebtedness as of December 31, 2019. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred in connection with the Company\u2019s separation from RRD on October 1, 2016 (the \u201cseparation\u201d), as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not generate sufficient funds to service our debt and meet our business needs, such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions, including facility closures, staff reductions, reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and restricting future capital return to stockholders. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the print and related services industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business and consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, our leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged. These competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and secure additional financing for their operations. Our leverage could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy in general.\nThe agreements and instruments that govern our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Agreement that governs our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture that governs the Senior Secured Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends, make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nincur or permit to exist certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese covenants can have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete. In addition, the Credit Agreement that governs our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants. Operating results below historical or current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility.\nComplying with the covenants under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility and indenture may cause us to take actions that are not favorable to other creditors and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions. If we violate covenants under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility and or indenture and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and or indenture, as applicable, would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders, which would require us to pay all amounts outstanding. Because of cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other debt.\nWe are exploring alternatives to address our balance sheet which could substantially dilute or eliminate the value of our common stock or funded debt.\nWe have commenced a process to identify and evaluate possible alternatives to address the substantial amount of funded debt on our consolidated balance sheet. We are in ongoing discussions with certain of our lenders regarding such possible alternatives. These alternatives may involve the issuance of new common stock that substantially dilutes or eliminates the value of our currently-outstanding common stock or the extinguishment of our common stock or funded debt by legal process. There can be no assurances that our current stockholders or funded debt creditors will receive any recovery in connection with such a transaction, even if our current business continues under new ownership or with a new capital structure. No assurances can be given that any discussions or efforts will successfully result in any such transaction or guarantee any such transaction\u2019s terms or timing.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may be able to incur more debt.\nDespite our substantial amount of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. Although the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities restrict the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. The more indebtedness we incur, the further exposed we become to the risks associated with substantial leverage described above.\nStockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in LSC Communications may be diluted in the future.\nStockholders\u2019 percentage ownership in LSC Communications may be diluted in the future because of equity securities we issue, either as consideration for acquisitions, in connection with capital raises or for equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers and employees. Further, to the extent that LSC Communications raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of such financings may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Any such transaction will dilute stockholders\u2019 ownership in LSC Communications.\nThe anticipated changes to London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021 could impact the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nSome of our debt, including our credit facility, has a variable rate of interest linked to the LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. It is likely that banks will not continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and possible that they may not provide submissions before then. It is impossible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what effects any changes to LIBOR or the transition to alternative reference rates may have on the on variable rate credit facility loans or on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The consequence of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nIf LIBOR rates are no longer available or viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, and our lenders are required, or exercise discretion, to implement substitute reference rates for the calculation of interest rates under our credit facility, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with lenders over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute reference rates, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16278, "SIC": 2750, "TIC": "LKSDQ"}
