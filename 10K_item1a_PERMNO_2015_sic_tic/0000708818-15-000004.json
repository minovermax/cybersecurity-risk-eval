{"cik": "708818", "company": "QUALITY SYSTEMS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-05-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of these known or unknown risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our common stock may decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face significant, evolving competition which, if we fail to properly address, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and price of our stock. The markets for healthcare information systems are intensely competitive, and we face significant competition from a number of different sources. Several of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition and financial, technical, product development and marketing resources than we do. There has been significant merger and acquisition activity among a number of our competitors in recent years. Transaction induced pressures, or other related factors may result in price erosion or other negative market dynamics that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and price of our stock.\nWe compete in all of our markets with other major healthcare related companies, information management companies, systems integrators and other software developers. Competitive pressures and other factors, such as new product introductions by us or our competitors, may result in price or market share erosion that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, there can be no assurance that our applications will achieve broad market acceptance or will successfully compete with other available software products.\nSaturation or consolidation in the healthcare industry could result in the loss of existing customers, a reduction in our potential customer base and downward pressure on the prices for our products and services. As the healthcare information systems market evolves, saturation of this market with our products or our competitors' products could limit our revenues and opportunities for growth. There has also been increasing consolidation amongst healthcare industry participants in recent years, creating integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. As provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate, the number of market participants decreases and competition to provide products and services like ours will become more intense. The importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants will become greater and our inability to make initial sales of our systems to, or maintain relationships with, newly formed groups and/or healthcare providers that are replacing or substantially modifying their healthcare information systems could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consolidated industry participants may also try to use their increased market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services. If we were forced to reduce our prices, our business would become less profitable unless we were able to achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses.\nMany of our competitors have greater resources than we do. In order to compete successfully, we must keep pace with our competitors in anticipating and responding to the rapid changes involving the industry in which we operate, or our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The software market generally is characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products that respond to technological changes or evolving industry standards. New product development depends upon significant research and development expenditures which depend ultimately upon sales growth. Any material shortfall in revenue or research funding could impair our ability to respond to technological advances or opportunities in the marketplace and to remain competitive. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIn response to increasing market demand, we are currently developing new generations of targeted software products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop these new software products or that these products will operate successfully, or that any such development, even if successful, will be completed concurrently with or prior to introduction of competing products. Any such failure or delay could adversely affect our competitive position or could make our current products obsolete.\nThe ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions may negatively impact our business, operating results or financial condition. The continuing unfavorable global economic conditions and uncertainty have caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. These macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition in a number of ways. For example, current or potential customers may be unable to fund software purchases, which could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or to not pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. Our customers may cease business operations or conduct business on a greatly reduced basis. Finally, our investment portfolio is generally subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by these global financial conditions. If the banking system or\nthe fixed income, credit or equity markets continue to deteriorate or remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected as well.\nWe face risk and/or the possibility of claims from activities related to strategic partners, which could be expensive and time-consuming, divert personnel and other resources from our business and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. We rely on third parties to provide services for our business. For example, we use national clearinghouses in the processing of some insurance claims and we outsource some of our hardware services and the printing and delivery of patient statements for our customers. These third parties could raise their prices and/or be acquired by our competitors, which could potentially create short and long-term disruptions to our business, negatively impacting our revenue, profit and/or stock price. We also have relationships with certain third parties where these third parties serve as sales channels through which we generate a portion of our revenue. Due to these third party relationships, we could be subject to claims as a result of the activities, products, or services of these third party service providers even though we were not directly involved in the circumstances leading to those claims. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, defending and investigating these claims could be expensive and time-consuming, divert personnel and other resources from our business and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions, which may be expensive, time consuming, subject to inherent risks and from which we may not realize anticipated benefits. We may acquire additional businesses, technologies and products if we determine that these additional businesses, technologies and products are likely to serve our strategic goals. We acquired Opus and Sphere during fiscal year 2010, IntraNexus and CQI during fiscal year 2012 and Poseidon during fiscal year 2013, all of which are developers of software and services for the hospital market. We also acquired ViaTrack during fiscal year 2012 which develops information technologies that enhance EDI offerings, Matrix during fiscal year 2013 which provides revenue cycle management services, and Mirth during fiscal year 2014 which develops health information technology that helps customers achieve interoperability. During fiscal year 2015, we acquired Gennius, Inc. which develops analytics based information technology that helps customers deliver accountable care. Acquisitions have inherent risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve projected synergies and performance targets;\n\u2022\npotentially dilutive issuances of our securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022\nusing cash as acquisition currency may adversely affect interest or investment income, which may in turn adversely affect our earnings and /or earnings per share;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in fully or effectively integrating the acquired technologies, software products, services, business practices or personnel, which would prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain uniform standard controls, policies and procedures across acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in predicting and responding to issues related to product transition such as development, distribution and customer support;\n\u2022\nthe possible adverse effect of such acquisitions on existing relationships with third party partners and suppliers of technologies and services;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that staff or customers of the acquired company might not accept new ownership and may transition to different technologies or attempt to renegotiate contract terms or relationships, including maintenance or support agreements;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the due diligence process in any such acquisition may not completely identify material issues associated with product quality, product architecture, product development, intellectual property issues, key personnel issues or legal and financial contingencies, including any deficiencies in internal controls and procedures and the costs associated with remedying such deficiencies;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in entering geographic and/or business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating acquired operations due to geographical distance and language and cultural differences;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that acquired assets become impaired, requiring us to take a charge to earnings which could be significant.\nA failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or technology could, for any of these reasons, have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to manage growth could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have in the past experienced periods of growth which have placed, and may continue to place, a significant strain on our non-cash resources. We also anticipate expanding our overall software development, marketing, sales, customer management and training capacity. In the event we are unable to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals in such capacities within a reasonable timeframe, such failure could have an adverse effect on the operation of our business. In addition, our ability to manage future increases, if any, in the scope of our operations or personnel will depend on significant expansion of our research and development, marketing and sales, management and administrative and financial capabilities. The failure of our management to effectively manage expansion in our business could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are dependent upon our key personnel. If such personnel were to leave unexpectedly, we may not be able to execute our business plan. Our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key development and senior management personnel and successful recruitment of new talent. These personnel have specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our business and our industry. Because we have a relatively small number of employees when compared to other leading companies in our industry, our dependence on maintaining our relationships with key employees and successful recruiting is particularly significant.\nThe industry in which we operate is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel. There can be no assurance that our current employees will continue to work for us. Loss of services of key employees could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may need to grant additional equity incentives to key employees and provide other forms of incentive compensation to attract and retain such key personnel. Equity incentives may be dilutive to our per share financial performance. Failure to provide such types of incentive compensation could jeopardize our recruitment and retention capabilities.\nThe integration of our Chief Financial Officer into our management team may interfere with our operations. We have appointed an Interim Chief Financial Officer as a result of the recent resignation of our former Chief Financial Officer. Our Interim Chief Financial Officer, and the individual who is appointed as our replacement Chief Financial Officer, will be required to spend a significant amount of time on certain integration and transition efforts in addition to performing his or her regular duties and responsibilities. If we fail to complete this integration in an efficient manner, our business and prospects may suffer.\nContinuing worldwide political and economic uncertainties may adversely affect our revenue and profitability. The last several years have been periodically marked by concerns including but not limited to inflation, decreased consumer confidence, the lingering effects of international conflicts, energy costs and terrorist and military activities. Although certain indices and economic data have shown signs of stabilization in the United States and certain global markets, there can be no assurance that these improvements will be broad-based or sustainable. This instability can make it extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and could cause constrained spending on our products and services, delays and a lengthening of our sales cycles and/or difficulty in collection of our accounts receivable. Bankruptcies or similar insolvency events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. Further, an ongoing economic stability in the global markets could limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing business conditions or new opportunities. Accordingly, if worldwide political and economic uncertainties continue or worsen, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth in the new markets we may enter, our business and financial results could suffer. Our future financial results will depend in part on our ability to profitably manage our business in new markets that we may enter. We are engaging in the strategic identification of, and competition for, growth and expansion opportunities in new markets or offerings, including but not limited to the areas of interoperability, patient engagements, data analytics and population health. In order to successfully execute on these future initiatives, we will need to, among other things, manage changing business conditions and develop expertise in areas outside of our business's traditional core competencies. Difficulties in managing future growth in new markets could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in developing or launching our new software products and services, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We invest significant resources in the research and development of new and enhanced software products and services. Over the last few years we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant internal research and development expenses that are recorded as capitalized software costs. We cannot provide assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to develop or sell new software products, which could result in an impairment of the value of the related capitalized software costs, an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results and a negative impact the future of our business.\nWe own a captive facility, located in India that subjects us to regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties in India. We are subject to several risks associated with having a portion of our assets and operations located in India. Many US companies have benefited from many policies of the Government of India and the Indian state governments in the states in which we operate, which are designed to promote foreign investment generally and the business process services industry in particular, including significant tax incentives, relaxation of regulatory restrictions, liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation. There is no assurance that such policies will continue. Various factors, such as changes in the current Government of India, could trigger significant changes in India\u2019s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular. In addition, our financial performance and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in India, including changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates and taxation policies, as well as social stability and political, economic or diplomatic developments affecting India in the future. In particular, India has experienced significant economic growth over the last several years, but faces major challenges in sustaining that growth in the years ahead. These challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure development and improving access to healthcare and education. Our ability to recruit, train and retain qualified employees, develop and operate our captive facility could be adversely affected if India does not successfully meet these challenges.\nWe could suffer further charges due to asset impairment that could reduce our income. We test our goodwill for impairment annually during our first fiscal quarter, and on interim dates should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. During the quarter ended March 31, 2013, we recorded a $17.4 million goodwill impairment charge relating to our Hospital Solutions Division and during the quarter ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $26.0 million impairment charge relating to certain long-lived assets of our Hospital Solutions Division. Declines in business performance or other factors could cause the fair value of any of our operating segments to be revised downward, resulting in further impairment charges. If\nthe financial outlook for any of our operating segments warrants additional impairments of goodwill, the resulting write-downs could materially affect our reported net earnings.\nWe face the risks and uncertainties that are associated with litigation against us, which may adversely impact our marketing, distract management and have a negative impact upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face the risks associated with litigation concerning the operation of our business. For example, companies in our industry, including many of our competitors, have been subject to litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In particular, patent holding companies often engage in litigation to seek to monetize patents that they have obtained. As the number of competitors, patents and patent holding companies in our industry increases, the functionality of our products and services expands, and we enter into new geographies and markets, the number of intellectual property rights-related actions against us is likely to continue to increase. The uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved litigation may have an adverse effect on our business. In particular, such litigation could impair our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers. Defending such litigation may result in a diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such litigation may also have the effect of discouraging potential acquirers from bidding for us or reducing the consideration such acquirers would otherwise be willing to pay in connection with an acquisition.\nThere can be no assurance that such litigation will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage, that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates.\nWe may be impacted by IT system failures or other disruptions. We may be subject to IT systems failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to or the delivery of certain of our products or services, compromise our data or our customers\u2019 data, or result in delayed or cancelled orders as well as potentially expose us to third party claims. System failures and disruptions could also impede our transactions processing services and financial reporting.\nOur business operations are subject to interruption by, among other, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other issues beyond our control. Such events could decrease our demand for our products or services or make it difficult or impossible for us to develop and deliver our products or services to our customers. A significant portion of our research and development activities, our corporate headquarters, our IT systems, and certain of our other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas. In the event of a business disruption in one or more of those areas, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time, and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe face risks related to litigation advanced by a former director and shareholder of ours, a putative class action and a shareholder derivative claim. On October 7, 2013, a complaint was filed against us and certain of our officers and directors in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Orange, captioned Ahmed D. Hussein v. Sheldon Razin, Steven Plochocki, Quality Systems, Inc. and Does 1-10, inclusive, No. 30-2013-00679600-CU-NP-CJC, by Ahmed Hussein, a former director and significant shareholder of ours. The complaint generally alleges fraud and deceit, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with statements made to our shareholders regarding our financial condition and projected future performance. On November 19, 2013, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of the Company\u2019s officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, captioned Deerfield Beach Police Pension Fund, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. Quality Systems, Inc., Steven T. Plochocki, Paul A. Holt and Sheldon Razin, No. SACV13-01818-CJC-JPRx, by the Deerfield Beach Police Pension Fund, a shareholder of the Company. The complaint is a putative class action filed on behalf of the shareholders of the Company other than the defendants. The complaint, which is substantially similar to the complaint filed by Mr. Hussein described above, generally alleges that statements made to the Company\u2019s shareholders regarding the Company\u2019s financial condition and projected future performance were false and misleading in violation of the Exchange Act, and that the individual defendants are liable for such statements because they are controlling persons under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On January 24, 2014, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of the Company\u2019s officers and current and former directors in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, captioned Timothy J. Foss, derivatively on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, vs. Craig A. Barbarosh, George H. Bristol, James C. Malone, Peter M. Neupert, Morris Panner, D. Russell Pflueger, Steven T. Plochocki, Sheldon Razin, Lance E. Rosenzweig and Quality Systems, Inc., No. SACV14-00110-DOC-JPPx, by Timothy J. Foss, a shareholder of the Company. The complaint arises from the same allegations described above related to the complaints filed by Mr. Hussein and the Deerfield Beach Police Pension Fund and generally alleges breach of fiduciary duties, abuse of control and gross mismanagement by the Company\u2019s directors, in addition to unjust enrichment and insider selling by individual directors. Although we believe the claims to be without merit, our operating results and share price may be negatively impacted due to the negative publicity, expenses incurred in connection with our defense, management distraction, and/or other factors related to this litigation. In addition, litigation of this nature may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers and strategic partners, as well as qualified board members and management personnel.\nRisks Related to Our Products and Services\nIf our principal products, new product developments or implementation, training and support services fail to meet the needs of our customers, we may fail to realize future growth, suffer reputational harm and face the risk of losing existing customers. We currently derive substantially all of our net revenue from sales of our healthcare information systems and related services. We believe that a primary factor in the market acceptance of our systems has been our ability to meet the needs of users of healthcare information systems. Our future financial performance will depend in large part on our ability to continue to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers through the timely development and successful introduction of new and enhanced versions of our systems and other complementary products, as well as our ability to provide high quality implementation, training and support services for our products. We have historically expended a significant percentage of our net revenue on product development and believe that significant continuing product development efforts will be\nrequired to retain our existing customers and sustain our growth. Continued investment in our sales staff and our customer implementation, training and support staffs will also be required to retain and grow our customer base.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in our customer satisfaction or product development efforts, that the market will continue to accept our existing products and services, or that new products or product enhancements will be developed and implemented in a timely manner, meet the requirements of healthcare providers, or achieve market acceptance. If new products or product enhancements are delayed or do not achieve market acceptance, or if our implementation, training and support services do not achieve a high degree of customer satisfaction, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. At certain times in the past, we have also experienced delays in purchases of our products by customers anticipating our launch, or the launch of our competitors, of new products. There can be no assurance that material order deferrals in anticipation of new product introductions from ourselves or other entities will not occur.\nIf the emerging technologies and platforms of Microsoft and others upon which we build our products do not gain or continue to maintain broad market acceptance, or if we fail to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products and services compatible with such emerging technologies, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer. Our software products are built and depend upon several underlying and evolving relational database management system platforms such as those developed by Microsoft. To date, the standards and technologies upon which we have chosen to develop our products have proven to have gained industry acceptance. However, the market for our software products is subject to ongoing rapid technological developments, quickly evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements, and there may be existing or future technologies and platforms that achieve industry standard status, which are not compatible with our products.\nWe are dependent on our license rights and other services from third parties, which may cause us to discontinue, delay or reduce product shipments. We depend upon licenses for some of the technology used in our products as well as other services from third party vendors. Most of these arrangements can be continued/renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated for any number of reasons. We may not be able to continue using the products or services made available to us under these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As a result, we may have to discontinue, delay or reduce product shipments or services provided until we can obtain equivalent technology or services. Most of our third party licenses are non-exclusive. Our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the business elements covered by these arrangements and use these elements to compete directly with us. In addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue providing their technology or services in the future or are unsuccessful in their continued research and development efforts, we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products.\nWe may experience interruption at our data centers or customer support facilities. We perform data center and/or hosting services for certain customers, including the storage of critical patient and administrative data at company-owned facilities and through third party hosting arrangements. In addition, we provide support services to our customers through various customer support facilities. We have invested in reliability features such as multiple power feeds, multiple backup generators and redundant telecommunications lines, as well as technical (such as multiple overlapping security applications, access control and other countermeasures) and physical security safeguards, and structured our operations to reduce the likelihood of disruptions. However, complete failure of all local public power and backup generators, impairment of all telecommunications lines, a concerted denial of service cyber-attack, a significant data breach, damage, injury or impairment (environmental, accidental, intentional or pandemic) to the buildings, the equipment inside the buildings housing our data centers, the personnel operating such facilities or the customer data contained therein, or errors by the personnel trained to operate such facilities could cause a disruption in operations and negatively impact customers who depend on us for data center and system support services. Any interruption in operations at our data centers and/or customer support facilities could damage our reputation, cause us to lose existing customers, hurt our ability to obtain new customers, result in significant revenue loss, create potential liabilities for our customers and us and increase insurance and other operating costs.\nWe face the possibility of having to adopt new pricing strategies, such as subscription pricing or bundling. In April 2009, we announced a new subscription based software as a service delivery model which includes monthly subscription pricing. This model is designed for smaller practices to quickly access the NextGen\u00ae Ambulatory EHR or NextGen\u00ae PM products at a modest monthly per provider price. We currently derive substantially all of our systems revenue from traditional software license, implementation and training fees, as well as the resale of computer hardware. Today, the majority of our customers pay an initial license fee for the use of our products, in addition to a periodic maintenance fee. While the intent of the new subscription based delivery model is to further penetrate the smaller practice market, there can be no assurance that this delivery model will not become increasingly popular with both small and large customers. In addition, we have experienced increasing demand for bundling our software and systems with RCM service arrangements, which has required us to modify our standard upfront license fee pricing model. If the marketplace increasingly demands subscription or bundled pricing, we may be forced to further adjust our sales, marketing and pricing strategies accordingly, by offering a higher percentage of our products and services through these means. Shifting to a significantly greater degree of subscription or bundled pricing could adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and quarterly and annual revenue and results of operations, as our revenue would initially decrease substantially.\nWe face the possibility of claims based upon our website content, which may cause us expense and management distraction. We could be subject to third party claims based on the nature and content of information supplied on our website by us or third parties, including content providers or users. We could also be subject to liability for content that may be accessible through our website or third party websites linked from our website or through content and information that may be posted by users in chat rooms, bulletin boards or on websites created by professionals using our applications. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations.\nIf our security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities. Our services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information and protected health information of patients. Because of the sensitivity of this\ninformation, security features of our software are very important. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to customer or patient data. As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and significant costs for remediation and remediation efforts to prevent future occurrences. We rely upon our customers as users of our system for key activities to promote security of the system and the data within it, such as administration of customer-side access credentialing and control of customer-side display of data. On occasion, our customers have failed to perform these activities. Failure of customers to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. In addition, our customers may authorize or enable third parties to access their customer data or the data of their patients on our systems. Because we do not control such access, we cannot ensure the complete propriety of that access or integrity or security of such data in our systems.\nFailure by our customers to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business. We require our customers to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so. If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other applicable laws. This could impair our functions, processes and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data. In addition, this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that are beneficial to our business. Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission or waiver. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face the possibility of damages resulting from internal and external security breaches. In the course of our business operations, we compile and transmit confidential information, including patient health information, in our processing centers and other facilities. A breach of security in any of these facilities could damage our reputation and result in damages being assessed against us. In addition, the other systems with which we may interface, such as the Internet and related systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, viruses, programming errors, or similar disruptive problems. The effect of these security breaches and related issues could disrupt our ability to perform certain key business functions and could potentially reduce demand for our services. Accordingly, we have expended significant resources toward establishing and enhancing the security of our related infrastructures, although no assurance can be given that they will be entirely free from potential breach. Maintaining and enhancing our infrastructure security may require us to expend significant capital in the future.\nThe success of our strategy to offer our EDI services and Internet solutions depends on the confidence of our customers in our ability to securely transmit confidential information. Our EDI services and Internet solutions rely on encryption, authentication and other security technology licensed from third parties to achieve secure transmission of confidential information. We may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to or disrupt the transmission of communications by our customers. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate confidential user information or interrupt our, or our customers\u2019, operations. In addition, our EDI and Internet solutions may be vulnerable to viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.\nAny failure to provide secure infrastructure and/or electronic communication services could result in a lack of trust by our customers causing them to seek out other vendors and/or damage our reputation in the market, making it difficult to obtain new customers.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our customers, which is not within our control. We deliver Internet-based services and, accordingly, depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the Internet. This access is currently provided by third parties that have significant market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and government-owned service provides -- all of whom are outside of our control. In the event of any difficulties, outages and delays by Internet service providers, we may be impeded from providing services, resulting in a loss of potential or existing customers.\nWe may be subject to claims for system errors, warranties or product liability, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our software solutions are intended for use in collecting, storing and displaying clinical and healthcare-related information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients and in related healthcare settings such as admissions and billing. Therefore, users of our software solutions have a greater sensitivity to errors than the market for software products generally. Any failure by our products to provide accurate and timely information concerning patients, their medication, treatment and health status, generally, could result in claims against us which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance, industry reputation and ability to market new system sales. In addition, a court or government agency may take the position that our delivery of health information directly, including through licensed practitioners, or delivery of information by a third party site that a consumer accesses through our websites, exposes us to assertions of malpractice, other personal injury liability, or other liability for wrongful delivery/handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information. We maintain insurance to protect against claims associated with the use of our products as well as liability limitation language in our end-user license agreements, but there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage or contractual language would adequately cover any claim asserted against us. A successful claim brought against us in excess of or outside of our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even unsuccessful claims could result in our expenditure of funds for litigation and management time and resources.\nCertain healthcare professionals who use our Internet-based products will directly enter health information about their patients including information that constitutes a record under applicable law that we may store on our computer systems. Numerous federal and state laws and\nregulations, the common law and contractual obligations, govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information, including:\n\u2022\nstate and federal privacy and confidentiality laws;\n\u2022\nour contracts with customers and partners;\n\u2022\nstate laws regulating healthcare professionals;\n\u2022\nMedicaid laws;\n\u2022\nthe HIPAA and related rules proposed by CMS; and\n\u2022\nCMS standards for Internet transmission of health data.\nHIPAA establishes elements including, but not limited to, federal privacy and security standards for the use and protection of Protected Health Information. Any failure by us or by our personnel or partners to comply with applicable requirements may result in a material liability to us.\nAlthough we have systems and policies in place for safeguarding Protected Health Information from unauthorized disclosure, these systems and policies may not preclude claims against us for alleged violations of applicable requirements. Also, third party sites and/or links that consumers may access through our web sites may not maintain adequate systems to safeguard this information, or may circumvent systems and policies we have put in place. In addition, future laws or changes in current laws may necessitate costly adaptations to our policies, procedures, or systems.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not be subject to product liability claims, that such claims will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage, that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates. Such product liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct which we cannot control and accordingly, there is no assurance that revenue for our services will continue at historic levels. We offer certain electronic claims submission products and services as part of our product line. While we have implemented certain product features designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims submissions, these features may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers. Should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payers, we may be subject to liability claims.\nElectronic data transmission services are offered by certain payers to healthcare providers that establish a direct link between the provider and payer. This process reduces revenue to third party EDI service providers such as us. As a result of this, and other market factors, we are unable to ensure that we will continue to generate revenue at or in excess of prior levels for such services.\nA significant increase in the utilization of direct links between healthcare providers and payers could adversely affect our transaction volume and financial results. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing links to payers or develop new connections on terms that are economically satisfactory to us, if at all.\nProprietary rights are material to our success, and the misappropriation of these rights could adversely affect our business and our financial condition. We are heavily dependent on the maintenance and protection of our intellectual property and we rely largely on technical security measures, license agreements, confidentiality procedures and employee nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. The majority of our software is not patented and existing copyright laws offer only limited practical protection.\nThere can be no assurance that the legal protections and precautions we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that competitors will not independently develop technologies equivalent or superior to ours. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States and are often not enforced as vigorously as those in the United States.\nWe do not believe that our operations or products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. However, there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement or trade secret claims against us with respect to our current or future products or that any such assertion will not require us to enter into a license agreement or royalty arrangement or other financial arrangement with the party asserting the claim. Responding to and defending any such claims may distract the attention of our management and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, claims may be brought against third parties from which we purchase software, and such claims could adversely affect our ability to access third party software for our systems.\nIf we are deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services. We have been, and may be in the future, subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our applications' functionality is viewed as similar or overlapping with competitive products. We do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties. However, claims are occasionally asserted against us, and we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us in the future. Also, we cannot assure you that any such claims will be unsuccessful. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims - even if we are ultimately successful in the defense of such matters. Furthermore, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. In addition, we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe face risks related to the periodic maintenance and upgrades that need to be made to our products. As we continue to develop and improve upon our technology and offerings, we need to periodically upgrade and maintain the products deployed to our customers. This\nprocess can require a significant amount of our internal time and resources, and be complicated and time consuming for our customers. Certain upgrades may also pose the risk of system delays or failure. If our periodic upgrades and maintenance cause disruptions to our customers, we may lose revenue-generating transactions, our customers may elect to use other solutions and we may also be the subject of negative publicity that may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nThere is significant uncertainty in the healthcare industry in which we operate, and the current governmental laws and regulations as well as any future modifications to the regulatory environment, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement processes and operation of healthcare facilities. During the past several years, the healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation of, among other things, reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures.\nFor example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as modified by HITECH provisions of the ARRA (collectively, \u201cHIPAA\u201d), continues to have a direct impact on the health care industry by requiring national provider identifiers and standardized transactions/code sets, operating rules and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the appropriate level of privacy of protected health information. These regulatory factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of health care organizations.\nThe PPACA, which was amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, became law in 2010. This comprehensive health care reform legislation included provisions to control health care costs, improve health care quality, and expand access to affordable health insurance. Together with ongoing statutory and budgetary policy developments at a federal level, this health care reform legislation could include changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment policies and other health care delivery administrative reforms that could potentially negatively impact our business and the business of our customers. Because not all the administrative rules implementing health care reform under the legislation have been finalized, and because of ongoing federal fiscal budgetary pressures yet to be resolved for federal health programs, the full impact of the health care reform legislation and of further statutory actions to reform healthcare payment on our business is unknown, but there can be no assurances that health care reform legislation will not adversely impact either our operational results or the manner in which we operate our business. Health care industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions, including investments in our solutions and services.\nVarious legislators have announced that they intend to examine further proposals to reform certain aspects of the U.S. healthcare system. Healthcare providers may react to these proposals, and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals, by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for our systems and related services. Cost-containment measures instituted by healthcare providers as a result of regulatory reform or otherwise could result in a reduction in the allocation of capital funds. Such a reduction could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our systems and related services. On the other hand, changes in the regulatory environment have increased and may continue to increase the needs of healthcare organizations for cost-effective data management and thereby enhance the overall market for healthcare management information systems. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such proposals or healthcare reforms might have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs existing regulations mature and become better defined, we anticipate that these regulations will continue to directly affect certain of our products and services, but we cannot fully predict the effect at this time. We have taken steps to modify our products, services and internal practices as necessary to facilitate our compliance with the regulations, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in a timely or complete manner. Achieving compliance with these regulations could be costly and distract management\u2019s attention and divert other company resources, and any noncompliance by us could result in civil and criminal penalties.\nDevelopments of additional federal and state regulations and policies have the potential to positively or negatively affect our business.\nOther specific risks include, but are not limited to, risks relating to:\nPrivacy and Security of Patient Information. As part of the operation of our business, we may have access to or our customers may provide to us individually-identifiable health information related to the treatment, payment, and operations of providers\u2019 practices. Government and industry legislation and rulemaking, especially HIPAA, HITECH and standards and requirements published by industry groups such as the Joint Commission require the use of standard transactions, standard identifiers, security and other standards and requirements for the transmission of certain electronic health information. These standards and requirements impose additional obligations and burdens on us, limiting the use and disclosure of individually-identifiable health information, and require us to enter into business associate agreements with our customers and vendors. Our business associates may interpret HIPAA requirements differently than we do, and we may not be able to adequately address the risks created by such interpretations. These new rules, and any future changes to privacy and security rules, may increase the cost of compliance and could subject us to additional enforcement actions, which could further increase our costs and adversely affect the way in which we do business.\nImplementation of ICD-10 Coding for Medical Coding. The CMS has mandated that all providers, payers, clearinghouses and billing services implement the use of new patient codes for medical coding, referred to as ICD-10 codes, on or before October 1, 2015. The ICD-10 transition mandate substantially increases the number of medical billing codes by which providers will seek reimbursement, increasing the complexity of submitting claims for reimbursement. Our efforts to provide services and solutions that enable our customers to comply with the ICD-10 mandate could be time consuming and expensive. In addition, due to the effort and expense of complying with the ICD-10 mandate, our customers may postpone or cancel decisions to purchase our solutions and services. Either of the foregoing, or any future delay in the ICD-10 transition, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInteroperability Standards. Our customers are concerned with and often require that our software solutions and health care devices be interoperable with other third party health care information technology suppliers. Market forces or governmental/regulatory authorities could create software interoperability standards that would apply to our solutions, health care devices or solutions, and if our software solutions,\nhealth care devices or services are not consistent with those standards, we could be forced to incur substantial additional development costs to conform.\nFDA Regulation. Our software may potentially be subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) as a medical device. Such regulation could require the registration of the applicable manufacturing facility and software and hardware products, application of detailed record-keeping and manufacturing standards, and FDA approval or clearance prior to marketing. An approval or clearance requirement could create delays in marketing, and the FDA could require supplemental filings or object to certain of these applications, the result of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealth Reform. The health reform laws discussed above and that may be enacted in the future contain and may contain various provisions which may impact us and our customers. Some of these provisions may have a positive impact, by expanding the use of electronic health records in certain federal programs, for example, while others, such as reductions in reimbursement for certain types of providers, may have a negative impact due to fewer available resources. Increases in fraud and abuse penalties may also adversely affect participants in the health care sector, including us.\nWe may not see the benefits from government funding programs initiated to accelerate the adoption and utilization of health information technology. While government programs have been implemented to improve the efficiency and quality of the healthcare sector, including expenditures to stimulate business and accelerate the adoption and utilization of healthcare technology, we may not see the anticipated benefits of such programs. Under the ARRA and the PPACA, unprecedented government financial resources are being invested in healthcare, including significant financial incentives to healthcare providers who can demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology since 2011. While we expect the ARRA and the PPACA to continue to create significant sales opportunities over the next several years, we are unsure of the immediate or long-term impact of these government actions.\nHITECH established the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs to provide incentive payments for eligible professionals, hospitals, and critical access hospitals as they adopt, implement, upgrade, or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. HITECH also authorized CMS to apply payment adjustments, or penalties, to Medicare eligible professionals and eligible hospitals that are not meaningful users under the Medicare EHR Incentive Program.\nAlthough we believe that our service offerings will meet the requirements of HITECH to allow our customers to qualify for financial incentives for implementing and using our services, there can be no guaranty that our customers will achieve meaningful use or actually receive such planned financial incentives for our services. We also cannot predict the speed at which healthcare providers will adopt electronic health record systems in response to these government incentives, whether healthcare providers will select our products and services or whether healthcare providers will implement an electronic health record system at all. In addition, the financial incentives associated with the meaningful use program are tied to provider participation in Medicare and Medicaid, and we cannot predict whether providers will continue to participate in these programs. Any delay in the purchase and implementation of electronic health records systems by healthcare providers in response to government programs, or the failure of healthcare providers to purchase an electronic health record system, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is also possible that additional regulations or government programs related to electronic health records, amendment or repeal of current healthcare laws and regulations or the delay in regulatory implementation could require us to undertake additional efforts to meet meaningful use standards, materially impact our ability to compete in the evolving healthcare IT market, materially impact healthcare providers' decisions to implement electronic health records systems or have other impacts that would be unfavorable to our business.\nWe may be subject to false or fraudulent claim laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement. In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment. Any failure of our RCM services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability including, but not limited to, criminal liability, could adversely affect demand for our services and could force us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to address the failure. Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our customer contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving customers doing business with government payers and have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn most cases where we are permitted to do so, we calculate charges for our RCM services based on a percentage of the collections that our customers receive as a result of our services. To the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent, it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has stated that it is concerned that percentage-based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices.\nA portion of our business involves billing of Medicare claims on behalf of its customers. In an effort to combat fraudulent Medicare claims, the federal government offers rewards for reporting of Medicare fraud which could encourage others to subject us to a charge of fraudulent claims, including charges that are ultimately proven to be without merit.\nIf our products fail to comply with evolving government and industry standards and regulations, we may have difficulty selling our products. We may be subject to additional federal and state statutes and regulations in connection with offering services and products via the Internet. On an increasingly frequent basis, federal and state legislators are proposing laws and regulations that apply to Internet commerce and communications. Areas being affected by these regulations include user privacy, pricing, content, taxation, copyright protection, distribution, and quality of products and services. To the extent that our products and services are subject to these laws and regulations, the sale of our products and services could be harmed.\nWe are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance, one or more of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations. Based on our reading and interpretations of relevant guidance, principles or concepts issued by, among other authorities, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Commission, we believe our current sales and licensing contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported. However, there continue to be issued interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales and licensing contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry. Future interpretations or changes by the regulators of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in changes in our revenue recognition and/or other accounting policies and practices that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have an adverse effect on our business, and our per share price may be adversely affected. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d) and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC to implement Section 404, we are required to include in our Form 10-K a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The assessment must include disclosure of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management.\nAs part of the evaluation undertaken by management and our independent registered public accountants pursuant to Section 404, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2015. However, if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting, we may discover material weaknesses that we would then be required to disclose. Any material weaknesses identified in our internal controls could have an adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to accurately or timely report on our financial results, and we might be subject to investigation by regulatory authorities. This could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which may have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nNo evaluation process can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect and correct all failures within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments. In addition, if we continue to expand, through either organic growth or through acquisitions (or both), the challenges involved in implementing appropriate controls will increase and may require that we evolve some or all of our internal control processes.\nIt is also possible that the overall scope of Section 404 may be revised in the future, thereby causing ourselves to review, revise or reevaluate our internal control processes which may result in the expenditure of additional human and financial resources.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe unpredictability of our quarterly operating results may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline. Our revenue may fluctuate in the future from quarter to quarter and period to period, as a result of a number of factors including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe size and timing of orders from customers;\n\u2022\nthe specific mix of software, hardware and services in customer orders;\n\u2022\nthe length of sales cycles and installation processes;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our customers to obtain financing for the purchase of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing policies or price reductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product announcements and product introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue recognition or other accounting guidelines employed by us and/or established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") or other rule-making bodies;\n\u2022\naccounting policies concerning the timing of the recognition of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of system components;\n\u2022\nthe financial stability of customers;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of new products, applications and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and market new products, applications and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nour success in expanding our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022\ndeferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products, applications, product enhancements, or public/private sector initiatives;\n\u2022\nexecution of or changes to our strategy;\n\u2022\npersonnel changes; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market/economic factors.\nOur software products are generally shipped as orders are received and accordingly, we have historically operated with a minimal backlog of license fees. As a result, revenue in any quarter is dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and is not predictable with any\ndegree of certainty. Furthermore, our systems can be relatively large and expensive, and individual systems sales can represent a significant portion of our revenue and profits for a quarter such that the loss or deferral of even one such sale can adversely affect our quarterly revenue and profitability.\nCustomers often defer systems purchases until our quarter end, so quarterly results generally cannot be predicted and frequently are not known until after the quarter has concluded.\nOur sales are dependent upon customers\u2019 initial decisions to replace or substantially modify their existing information systems, and subsequently, their decision concerning which products and services to purchase. These are major decisions for healthcare providers and, accordingly, the sales cycle for our systems can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to twenty-four months from initial contact to contract execution/shipment.\nBecause a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed, a variation in the timing of systems sales, implementations and installations can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result, we believe that interim period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. Further, our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for any particular period.\nWe currently recognize revenue in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance as defined by the FASB.\nThere can be no assurance that application and subsequent interpretations of these pronouncements will not further modify our revenue recognition policies, or that such modifications would not adversely affect our operating results reported in any particular quarter or year.\nDue to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In such event, the price of our common stock would likely be adversely affected.\nOur common stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares of our common stock and in litigation against us. Volatility may be caused by a number of factors including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nrumors about our performance, software solutions, or merger and acquisition activity;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulatory action;\n\u2022\nhealth care reform measures;\n\u2022\ncustomer relationship developments;\n\u2022\npurchases or sales of company stock;\n\u2022\nactivities by one or more of our major shareholders concerning our policies and operations;\n\u2022\nchanges occurring in the markets in general;\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions, both nationally and internationally; and\n\u2022\nother factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nFurthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for software, healthcare and high technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.\nMoreover, in the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nTwo current and former directors are significant shareholders, which makes it possible for them to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval and which influence may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of our other shareholders. One of our directors is a significant shareholder who beneficially owns approximately 16.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at March 31, 2015. Another former director, who owns approximately 9.4% (based on publicly filed information) of the outstanding shares of our common stock at March 31, 2015, likely maintains a large enough ownership stake to reelect himself to our Board of Directors under cumulative voting. California law and our Bylaws permit our shareholders to cumulate their votes, the effect of which is to provide shareholders with sufficiently large concentrations of our shares the opportunity to assure themselves one or more seats on our Board of Directors. The amounts required to assure a seat on our Board of Directors can vary based upon the number of shares outstanding, the number of shares voting, the number of directors to be elected, the number of \u201cbroker non-votes,\u201d and the number of shares held by the shareholder exercising the cumulative voting rights. In the event that cumulative voting is invoked, it is likely that these two individuals that are significant shareholders will each have sufficient votes to assure themselves of one or more seats on our Board of Directors. With or without cumulative voting, these two significant shareholders will have substantial influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions. This influence may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of our other shareholders. For example, in fiscal year 2013, the former director launched a proxy contest to elect a different slate of directors than what our Company proposed to shareholders. We spent approximately $1.3 million to defend against the proxy contest and elect the Company's slate of directors. In addition, such influence by one or both of these shareholders\ncould have the effect of discouraging others from attempting to acquire our Company or create actual or perceived governance instabilities that could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur future practice concerning the payment of dividends is uncertain, which could adversely affect the price of our stock. We announced our intention to pay a quarterly dividend commencing with the conclusion of our first fiscal quarter of 2008 (June 30, 2007) and pursuant to this practice our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend ranging from $0.125 to its most recent level of $0.175 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock, each quarter thereafter. We anticipate that future quarterly dividends, if and when declared by our Board of Directors pursuant to this practice, would likely be distributable on or about the fifth day of each of the months of October, January, April and July. There can be no guarantees that we will have the financial ability to fund this dividend in perpetuity or to pay it at historic rates. Further, our Board of Directors may decide not to pay the dividend at some future time for financial or non-financial reasons. Unfulfilled expectations regarding future dividends could adversely affect the price of our stock.", "PERMNO": 64961, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "NXGN"}
