{"cik": "814585", "company": "MBIA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nReferences in the risk factors to the \u201cCompany\u201d are to MBIA Inc., together with its domestic and international subsidiaries. References to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d are to MBIA Inc. or the Company, as the context requires. Our risk factors are grouped into categories and are presented in the following order: \u201cInsured Portfolio Loss Related Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cStrategic Plan Related and Other Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cCapital, Liquidity and Market Related Risk Factors\u201d and \u201cMBIA Corp. Risk Factors.\u201d Risk factors are listed in order of significance within each category.\nInsured Portfolio Loss Related Risk Factors\nSome of the state, local and territorial governments and finance authorities and other providers of public services, located in the U.S. or abroad, that issue public finance obligations we insure are experiencing unprecedented fiscal stress that could result in increased credit losses or impairments on those obligations\nAlthough the financial conditions of many state, local and territorial governments and finance authorities that issue the obligations we insure have improved since the financial crisis, some issuers continue to report unprecedented fiscal stress that has required them to significantly raise taxes or cut spending in order to satisfy their obligations. In particular, certain jurisdictions have significantly underfunded pension liabilities which are placing additional stress on their finances and are particularly challenging to restructure either through negotiation or under Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. If the issuers of the obligations in our public finance portfolio are unable to raise taxes, cut spending, or receive state or federal assistance, we may experience losses or impairments on those obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial stress experienced by certain municipal issuers could result in the filing of Chapter 9 proceedings in states where municipal issuers are permitted to seek bankruptcy protection. In these proceedings, which remain rare, the resolution of bondholder claims (and by extension, those of bond insurers) may be subject to legal challenge by other creditors.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nPuerto Rico is experiencing fiscal stress and constrained liquidity due to, among other things, Puerto Rico\u2019s structural budget imbalance, limited access to the capital markets, a stagnating local economy, net migration of people out of Puerto Rico and a high debt burden. Although Puerto Rico has tried to address its significant financial challenges through various fiscal policies and by the passage of a balanced general fund budget, it continues to experience significant fiscal stress. The Governor of Puerto Rico has stated that the island\u2019s approximately $70 billion in debt is \u201cnot payable\u201d and has actively lobbied the US Congress for bankruptcy reform and other Federal support. Furthermore, the Governor formed a working group to study and make recommendations regarding Puerto Rico\u2019s short- and long-term challenges. In September of 2015, this working group released a report that projected a sizable deficit of available cash resources to expenses and debt service over the next five years absent meaningful fiscal and structural reform, and concluded that a voluntary adjustment of the terms of the Commonwealth\u2019s debt is necessary.\nWe continue to believe, based on our analysis of Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal and structural circumstances, the details of our insured exposures, and our legal and contractual rights, that all of our insured Puerto Rico related debt will ultimately be substantially repaid. As of December 31, 2015, National had $3.9 billion of gross par outstanding ($4.3 billion of gross par outstanding when including accreted interest on capital appreciation bonds (\u201cCABs\u201d)) related to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain of its instrumentalities (\u201cPuerto Rico\u201d). Puerto Rico is experiencing fiscal stress due to, among other things, Puerto Rico\u2019s structural budget imbalance, a stagnating local economy, net migration of people and a high debt burden. However, it has attempted to address its significant economic challenges by passing a balanced general fund budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016 and approving a proposed tax reform bill. In addition, in December of 2015, National and other stakeholders entered into a restructuring support agreement with Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\u201cPREPA\u201d) addressing, among other things, the treatment of approximately 65% of $8.1 billion of outstanding PREPA bonds, including approximately $1.4 billion of PREPA bonds insured by National. Refer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures\u201d section in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional information on our Puerto Rico exposures. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth and/or its instrumentalities may be unable or unwilling to pay their obligations as and when due, in which case National would be required to pay claims of unpaid principal and interest when due under its insurance policies, which could be material. While National would seek to recover any claim payments it makes under its guarantees, there is no assurance that it will be able to recover such payments. To the extent that its claims payments are ultimately substantially greater than its claims recoveries, National may experience material losses on those obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, if the Commonwealth and/or certain of its instrumentalities were granted access to Chapter 9 under the federal Bankruptcy law, as has been proposed by various federal legislators and recommended by the Obama administration, any such filing could result in substantial delays in payments on the National insured bonds issued by such instrumentalities and could provide a mechanism to bind National and other creditors to a plan of reorganization that results in an impairment of the National insured debt for such instrumentalities. Similar risks exist if Puerto Rico is ultimately able to adopt its own bankruptcy regime, which federal courts have thus far deemed to be unconstitutional but which issue is presently before the Supreme Court of the United States.\nLoss reserve estimates and credit impairments are subject to additional uncertainties and loss reserves may not be adequate to cover potential claims.\nOur insurance companies issue financial guarantee policies that insure the financial performance of the obligations guaranteed over an extended period of time, in some cases over 30 years, and which are unconditional and irrevocable. Under substantially all of our policies, we do not have a right to cancel the policy. We do not use traditional actuarial approaches to determine our loss reserves. The establishment of the appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving numerous assumptions, estimates and subjective judgments by management, and therefore, there can be no assurance that actual paid claims in our insured portfolio will not exceed its loss reserves. If our loss reserves are not adequate to cover actual paid claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We use financial models to project future paid claims on our insured portfolio, including insured credit derivatives, and to establish loss reserves and estimate impairments on insured credit derivatives. There can be no assurance that the future loss projection and impairments based on these models will ultimately reflect the actual losses and impairment that we experience. Additionally, small changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates could significantly impact loss expectations. For example, our loss reserves are discounted to a net present value reflecting our general obligation to pay claims over time and not on an accelerated basis. Risk-free rates are used to discount our loss reserves under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and the yield-to-maturity of each insurer\u2019s investment portfolio as of year-end is used to discount each insurer\u2019s loss reserves under statutory accounting principles. Accordingly, changes in the risk-free rates or the yield in our insurers\u2019 investment portfolios may materially impact loss reserves.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nPolitical and economic conditions in the United States, the Eurozone and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs a financial guarantee company, our insured exposures and our results of operations can be materially affected by general economic conditions, both in the U.S. and around the world. General global unrest, fraud, terrorism, catastrophic events, natural disasters, pandemics or similar events could disrupt the economy in the U.S. and other countries where we have insured exposure or operate our businesses. In certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. we face higher risks of governmental intervention through nationalization or expropriation of assets, changes in regulation, an inability to enforce our rights in court or otherwise and corruption, which may cause us to incur losses on the exposures we insure or reputational harm. For a discussion of the Company\u2019s exposure to sovereign debt, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-European Sovereign Debt Exposure\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nBudget deficits at all levels of government in the U.S., recessions, increases in corporate, municipal, sovereign, sub-sovereign or consumer default rates and other general economic conditions may adversely impact the Company\u2019s prospects for future business, as well as the performance of our insured portfolios and the Company\u2019s investment portfolio. In addition, we are exposed to correlation risk as a result of the possibility that multiple credits will experience losses as a result of any such event or series of events, in particular exposures that are backed by revenues from business and personal travel, such as aircraft securitizations and bonds backed by hotel taxes and car rental fleet securitizations.\nFinancial modeling involves uncertainty over ultimate outcomes, which makes it difficult to estimate liquidity, potential paid claims, loss reserves and fair values.\nThe Company uses third-party and internal financial models to estimate liquidity, potential paid claims, loss reserves and fair values. We use internal financial models to conduct liquidity stress-scenario testing to ensure that we maintain cash and liquid securities in an amount in excess of all stress scenario payment requirements. These measurements are performed on a legal entity and operating segment basis. We also rely on financial models, generated internally and supplemented by models generated by third parties, to estimate factors relating to the highly complex securities we insure, including future credit performance of the underlying assets, and to evaluate structures, rights and our potential obligations over time. We also use internal models for ongoing portfolio monitoring and to estimate case basis loss reserves and, where applicable, to report our obligations under our contracts at fair value. We may supplement such models with third-party models or use third-party experts to consult with our internal modeling specialists. Both internal and external models are subject to model risk and information risk, and there can be no assurance that the inputs into the models received from third parties will be accurate or that the models themselves are accurate or comprehensive in estimating our liquidity, potential future paid claims, related loss reserves and fair values or that they are similar to methodologies employed by our competitors, counterparties or other market participants. Estimates of our future paid claims, in particular, may materially impact our liquidity position. We may make changes to our paid claims, loss reserve or fair value models from time to time. These changes could materially impact our financial results.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not detect or prevent future losses.\nWe assess our risk management policies and procedures on a periodic basis. As a result of such assessment, we may take steps to change our internal risk assessment capabilities and procedures, portfolio management policies, systems and processes and our policies and procedures for monitoring and assessing the performance of our insured portfolio in changing market conditions. There can be no assurance, however, that these steps will be adequate to avoid future losses. In some cases, losses can be substantial, particularly if a loss occurs on a transaction in which we have a large notional exposure or on a transaction structured with large, bullet-type principal maturities.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nStrategic Plan Related and Other Risk Factors\nAn inability to maintain high stable insurer financial strength ratings for National or to generate investor demand for our financial guarantees may adversely affect our results of operations and business prospects.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve National\u2019s ratings. Many requirements imposed by the rating agencies in order for National to maintain high insurer financial strength ratings are outside of our control, and such requirements may necessitate raising additional capital or taking other remedial actions in a relatively short time frame in order to achieve or maintain the ratings necessary to attract new business and compete with other financial guarantee insurers, which could make the conduct of the business uneconomical or materially adversely affect our business prospects. Furthermore, there is no assurance that we will successfully comply with rating agency requirements, that these requirements or the related models and methodologies will not change or that, even if we comply with these requirements, a rating agency will not lower or withdraw its financial strength ratings with respect to any of our insurance companies.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that investor demand for our guarantees will increase regardless of our ratings. Finally, our inability to comply with any rating agency and regulatory single risk limits tests may also prevent us from writing future new business in the categories of risks that are exceeded in the case of the regulatory limits, or result in an inability to achieve or maintain our desired ratings, in the case of rating agency limits, and may adversely affect our business prospects.\nFuture demand for National\u2019s financial guarantee insurance depends on market and other factors that we do not control.\nThe demand for financial guarantee insurance depends upon many factors, some of which are beyond the control of the Company. Our ability to attract and compete for financial guarantee business in the municipal market is largely dependent on the financial strength ratings assigned to National by one or more of the rating agencies. It is also affected by the overall amount of new municipal bonds issued as well as level of interest rates and the spread between insured and uninsured bonds. In addition, the perceived financial strength of other financial guarantee insurers also affects demand for financial guarantee insurance. The impact of the financial crisis on certain participants in the financial guarantee industry may have eroded investors\u2019 confidence in the benefits of bond insurance. Based on current market penetration levels and overall market conditions, we do not expect the demand for municipal financial guarantee insurance to regain its pre-financial crisis level in the near term, if ever.\nIn addition, various investors may, due to regulatory or internal guidelines, lack additional capacity to purchase securities insured by certain financial guarantors, which may provide a competitive advantage to guarantors with fewer insured obligations outstanding. Differentials in trading values or investor capacity constraints that do not favor us would have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new business at appropriate pricing levels.\nCompetition may have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nNational faces competition from other financial guarantee insurance companies and other forms of credit enhancement, including senior-subordinated structures, credit derivatives, letters of credit and guarantees (for example, mortgage guarantees where pools of mortgage loans secure debt service payments) provided by banks and other financial institutions. We have observed increased competition for business among the active financial guarantors, and opportunities to write new business with attractive returns may be limited. Increased competition, either in terms of price, alternative structures, or the emergence of new providers of credit enhancement, could have an adverse effect on our insurance companies\u2019 business prospects.\nWe believe that issuers and investors distinguish among financial guarantors on the basis of various factors, including rating agency assessment, capitalization, size, insured portfolio concentration and financial performance. These distinctions may result in differentials in trading levels for securities insured by particular financial guarantors which, in turn, may provide a competitive advantage to those financial guarantors with better trading characteristics.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nDowngrades of the ratings of securities that we insure may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIndividual credits in our insured portfolio (including potential new credits) are assessed a rating agency \u201ccapital charge\u201d based on a variety of factors, including the nature of the credits\u2019 risk types, underlying ratings, tenor and expected and actual performance. In the event of an actual or perceived deterioration in creditworthiness, a reduction in the underlying rating or a change in the rating agency capital methodology, we may be required to hold more capital in reserve against credits in the insured portfolio, regardless of whether losses actually occur, or against potential new business. Significant reductions in underlying ratings of credits in an insured portfolio can produce significant increases in assessed \u201ccapital charges.\u201d There can be no assurance that each of our insurance companies\u2019 capital position will be adequate to meet any increased rating agency reserve requirements or that each insurance company will be able to secure additional capital necessary to support increased reserve requirements, especially at a time of actual or perceived deterioration in creditworthiness of new or existing credits. Also, while MBIA Corp. does not presently intend to write new business, if National suffered material increases in capital charges and was unable to increase capital, this could result in inadequate capital to support its ratings, which could have an adverse effect on its ability to write new business.\nRegulatory change could adversely affect our businesses, and regulations limit investors\u2019 ability to effect a takeover or business combination that shareholders might consider in their best interests.\nThe financial guarantee insurance industry has historically been and will continue to be subject to the direct and indirect effects of governmental regulation, including insurance laws, securities laws, tax laws, legal precedents and accounting rules affecting asset-backed and municipal obligations, as well as changes in those laws. Also, the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could expose our insurance companies, their directors or shareholders to fines, the loss of their insurance licenses, and the inability to engage in certain business activity, as the case may be. In addition, future legislative, regulatory or judicial changes could adversely affect National\u2019s ability to pursue business, materially impacting our financial results. These laws also limit investors\u2019 ability to affect a takeover or business combination without the approval of our insurance regulators.\nChanges to laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof could subject us to further restrictions on the type of business that we are authorized to insure. Any such restrictions could have a material effect on the amount of premiums that we earn in the future. Additionally, any changes to such laws and regulations could subject our insurance companies to increase reserving and capital requirements or more stringent regulation generally, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and future business. Finally, changes to accounting standards and regulations may require modifications to our accounting methodology, both prospectively and for prior periods; and such changes could have an adverse impact on our reported financial results and/or make it more difficult for investors to understand the economics of our business, and may thus influence the types or volume of business that we may choose to pursue.\nOur insurance companies could become subject to regulatory action.\nOur insurance companies are subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions that require them to maintain qualifying investments to support their reserves and minimum surplus. Furthermore, our insurance companies may be restricted from making commutation or other payments if doing so would cause them to fail to meet such requirements, and the NYSDFS may impose other remedial actions on us as described further below to the extent our insurance companies do not meet such requirements.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nUnder New York Insurance law, the Superintendent of the NYSDFS may apply for an order directing the rehabilitation or liquidation of a domestic insurance company under certain circumstances, including upon the insolvency of the company, if the company has willfully violated its charter or New York Insurance law or if the company is found, after examination, to be in such condition that further transaction of business would be hazardous to its policyholders, creditors or the public. The Superintendent of the NYSDFS may also suspend an insurer\u2019s license, restrict its license authority, or limit the amount of premiums written in New York if, after a hearing, the Superintendent of the NYSDFS determines that the insurer\u2019s surplus to policyholders is not adequate in relation to its outstanding liabilities or financial needs. If the Superintendent of the NYSDFS were to take any such action, it could result in the reduction or elimination of the payment of dividends to MBIA Inc. See Risk Factor \u201cAn MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding could accelerate certain of the Company\u2019s other obligations and have other adverse consequences\u201d under \u201cMBIA Corp. Risk Factors\u201d for the potential impacts of an MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding.\nIn addition to the Superintendent\u2019s authority to commence a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding, if the Superintendent finds that the liabilities of MBIA Insurance Corporation exceed its admitted assets, the Superintendent could use its authority under Section 1310 of the NYIL to order MBIA Insurance Corporation to cease making claims payments (a \u201c1310 Order\u201d). See Risk Factor \u201cContinuing elevated loss payments and delay or failure in realizing expected recoveries on insured RMBS transactions as well as certain other factors may materially and adversely affect MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s ability to meet liquidity needs and could cause the NYSDFS to put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding if it is not able to pay expected claims\u201d under \u201cMBIA Corp. Risk Factors\u201d for the potential impacts of a 1310 Order.\nInterruption in information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, could harm our business.\nWe depend heavily on our information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data we use to run our businesses. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control. Further, we face the risk of operational and technology failures by others, including various financial intermediaries and of vendors and parties to which we outsource the provision of services or business operations. If this risk is realized, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and other adverse effects on our business.\nDespite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our information technology and other systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or other security breaches, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data.\nInterruption in information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, whether due to actions by us or others, could delay or disrupt our ability to do business, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and other claims, lead to a loss of clients and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nAny impairment in the Company\u2019s future taxable income can materially affect the recoverability of our deferred tax assets.\nThe recoverability of a deferred tax asset is based on an assessment of the existence of future taxable income of appropriate character. To the extent that the Company\u2019s ability to recognize future taxable income from its existing insurance portfolio through scheduled premium earnings and net investment income becomes impaired, the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets may be materially affected by a corresponding increase to its valuation allowance.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nPrivate litigation claims could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs further set forth in \u201cNote 21: Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in certain litigations, and in the ordinary course of business, may be a defendant in or party to a new or threatened legal action. Although the Company intends to vigorously defend against any current or future action, any adverse ultimate outcome could result in a loss and/or have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company is dependent on key executives and the loss of any of these executives, or its inability to retain other key personnel, could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s success substantially depends upon its ability to attract and retain qualified employees and upon the ability of its senior management and other key employees to implement its business strategy. The Company believes there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which the Company competes. Except for the departure of Mr. Chaplin, which was announced on January 22, 2016, the Company is not aware of any other planned departures. The Company relies substantially upon the services of Joseph W. Brown, Chief Executive Officer, and other senior executives. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to retain the services of key executives. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or other key members of the Company\u2019s management team could adversely affect the implementation of its business strategy.\nA different view of the Internal Revenue Service from our current tax treatment of realized losses relating to insured CDS contracts can adversely affect our financial position.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s financial guarantee business, we have insured certain credit derivative contracts. We treat these insured derivative contracts as insurance contracts for statutory accounting purposes, which is the basis for computing U.S. federal taxable income. As such, the realized losses in connection with an insured event are considered loss reserve activities for tax purposes. Because the federal income tax treatment of CDS contracts is an unsettled area of tax law, in the event that the Internal Revenue Service takes a different view with respect to the tax treatment, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOwnership Change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code can have adverse tax consequences.\nIn connection with transactions in our shares from time to time, we may in the future experience an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the aggregate ownership of certain stockholders in our stock by more than 50 percentage points over a testing period (generally three years). If an ownership change were to occur, our ability to use certain tax attributes, including certain losses, credits, deductions or tax basis, may be limited. Calculating whether a Section 382 ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainties, including the complexity and ambiguity of Section 382 and limitations on a publicly traded company\u2019s knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. The Company performs detailed calculations during each quarter to determine if an ownership change has occurred and, based on the Company\u2019s current methodology of calculation, a Section 382 ownership change has not taken place.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nCapital, Liquidity and Market Related Risk Factors\nWe are a holding company and rely to a significant degree on cash flow from our principal operating subsidiaries and access to third party capital. A disruption in the cash flow from our subsidiaries or an inability to access capital could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and ultimately adversely affect liquidity.\nAs a holding company, MBIA Inc. is largely dependent on dividends, payments under our tax sharing agreement and advances in the form of intercompany loans from its subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, make capital investments in our subsidiaries and pay dividends, to the extent payable, on our capital stock, among other items. We expect that for the foreseeable future National will be the primary source of dividends and tax sharing agreement payments. National is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions, applicable to insurance companies generally, that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans and advances that it may pay. See \u201cNew York State Dividend Limitations\u201d in Part 1, Item 1 and \u201cNote 14: Insurance Regulations and Dividends\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of dividends.\nWe may also from time to time seek to raise capital from external sources. The Company\u2019s access to external sources of financing, as well as the cost of such financing, is dependent on various factors, including (i) the long-term debt ratings of the Company, (ii) expected dividends from our subsidiaries, (iii) the insurance financial strength ratings, financial condition and long-term business prospects of our insurance companies, (iv) the perceptions of the financial strength of our insurance companies and MBIA Inc. and (v) the outcome of our undertakings to collect excess spread and recoveries in connection with ineligible mortgage loans in our insured RMBS securitizations. Our debt ratings are influenced by numerous factors, either in absolute terms or relative to our peer group, such as financial leverage, balance sheet strength, capital structure and earnings trends. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, future growth, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nTo the extent that we are unable to access external capital necessary to support our insurance companies, our insurance companies may not have sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations, may have less capacity to write business and may not be able to pay dividends to us without experiencing adverse rating agency action. Consequently, our inability to maintain access to capital on favorable terms could have an adverse impact on our ability to pay losses and debt obligations, to pay dividends on our capital stock, to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, to pay our operating expenses and to make capital investments in our subsidiaries. In addition, future capital raises for equity or equity-linked securities could result in dilution to the Company\u2019s shareholders. In addition, some securities that the Company could issue, such as preferred stock or securities issued by the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of its common shares.\nWe have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition, and our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business and satisfy our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $1.9 billion of consolidated long-term debt, $1.0 billion of consolidated medium-term note liabilities and $462 million of consolidated investment agreement liabilities. Our substantial indebtedness and other liabilities could have material consequences because:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain additional financing, should such a need arise, which may limit our ability to satisfy obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\na large portion of MBIA Inc.\u2019s financial resources must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such debt;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance debt may be limited or the associated costs may increase;\n\u2022\nour flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions could be limited, or we may be prevented from carrying out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our businesses; and\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\n\u2022\nwe are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because a portion of our liabilities are at variable rates of interest or denominated in foreign currencies.\nAdverse developments in the credit markets may materially and adversely affect MBIA Inc.\u2019s ability to post collateral and meet other liquidity needs.\nCurrently, the majority of the cash and securities of MBIA Inc. is pledged against investment agreement liabilities, intercompany financing arrangements and derivatives, which limit its ability to raise liquidity through asset sales. If the market value or rating eligibility of the assets which are pledged against MBIA Inc.\u2019s obligations were to decline, we would be required to pledge additional eligible assets in order to meet minimum required collateral amounts against these liabilities. In such event, we may sell assets, potentially with substantial losses, finance unencumbered assets through intercompany facilities, or use free cash or other assets, although there can be no assurance that these strategies will be available or adequate to meet liquidity requirements.\nThe level of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial condition and future business.\nIncreases in prevailing interest rate levels can adversely affect the value of MBIA\u2019s investment portfolio and, therefore, our financial condition. In the event that investments must be sold in order to make payments on insured exposures or other liabilities, such investments would likely be sold at discounted prices. Increases in interest rates also adversely affect the values of investments collateralizing our interest rate swap contracts in our corporate operations, which would require the Company to post additional collateral to its counterparties. Additionally, in the insurance operations, increasing interest rates could lead to increased credit stress on transactions in our insured portfolio, while a decline in interest rates could result in larger loss reserves on a present value basis. Finally, increased interest rates could also decrease attractiveness for issuers to enter into capital markets transactions, which could also result in a corresponding decreasing demand for financial guarantee insurance in the future.\nLower interest rates can result in lower net interest income since a substantial portion of assets are now held in cash and cash equivalents given the increased focus on liquidity. Additionally, since prevailing interest rate levels can affect demand for financial guarantee insurance, lower interest rates are typically accompanied by narrower spreads between insured and uninsured obligations. The purchase of insurance during periods of relatively narrower interest rate spreads will generally provide lower cost savings to the issuer than during periods of relatively wider spreads. These lower cost savings could be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in demand for financial guarantee insurance.\nIn addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk in respect of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In addition to insured liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, some of the remaining liabilities in our corporate segment are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars and the assets of our corporate segment are predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies could substantially increase our potential obligations and statutory capital exposure. Conversely, the Company makes investments denominated in a foreign currency and the weakening of the foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar will diminish the value of such non-U.S. dollar denominated asset. Exchange rates have fluctuated significantly in recent periods and may continue to do so in the future, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nMBIA Corp. Risk Factors\nContinuing elevated loss payments and delay or failure in realizing expected recoveries on insured RMBS transactions as well as certain other factors may materially and adversely affect MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s ability to meet liquidity needs and could cause the NYSDFS to put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding if it is not able to pay expected claims.\nAs an insurance company, MBIA Insurance Corporation is particularly sensitive to the risk that it will not have sufficient resources to meet contractual payment obligations when due or to make settlement payments in order to terminate insured exposures to avoid losses. Management\u2019s expected liquidity and capital forecasts for MBIA Insurance Corporation for 2016 reflect adequate resources to pay expected claims. However, there is risk to the liquidity forecast as the Company\u2019s remaining insured exposures are potentially volatile. There are risks to the capital forecast due to those potential liabilities, potential volatility in the collection of excess spread and the remaining put-back recoverable, and potential volatility associated with the remaining insured portfolio that could deteriorate and result in loss reserves and claim payments, including claims on insured exposures that in some cases may require large bullet payments. In particular, MBIA Insurance Corporation insures $776 million gross par outstanding of notes issued by Zohar II, which matures in January of 2017. While we continue to work with our advisors on remediation strategies for Zohar II, if a significant claim is presented for this insured transaction, MBIA Insurance Corporation may not have sufficient liquid assets to pay such claim. In addition, MBIA Insurance Corporation insured the class A-1 and A-2 notes issued by Zohar I 2003-1, Limited (\u201cZohar I\u201d), which matured on November 20, 2015. Zohar I failed to pay the amounts due on the A-1 and A-2 notes, and MBIA Insurance Corporation paid a claim of approximately $149 million on such insured notes on their maturity date. MBIA Insurance Corporation is entitled to seek reimbursement of such claim plus interest and expenses and to exercise certain rights and remedies. On November 22, 2015, an involuntary bankruptcy petition (the \u201cInvoluntary Petition\u201d) was filed with respect to Zohar I by Patriarch Partners XV, LLC (\u201cPatriarch) in its capacity as a holder of the A-3 notes issued by Zohar I. On February 7, 2016, Patriarch filed a motion to dismiss the Involuntary Petition. To the extent the petition is ultimately not dismissed or a similar petition is filed with respect to Zohar II, MBIA\u2019s ability to exercise its rights and remedies and to liquidate collateral supporting the notes insured by MBIA may be restricted.\nIf MBIA Insurance Corporation experiences higher than expected claims payments or is unable collect expected recoveries, it may ultimately have insufficient resources to continue paying claims, which could cause the NYSDFS, under Article 74 of the NYIL, to put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding. The determination to commence such a proceeding is not within the control of the Company. Given the separation of MBIA Inc. and MBIA Corp. as distinct legal entities, the absence of any material intercompany lending agreements or cross defaults between the entities, and the lack of reliance by MBIA Inc. on MBIA Corp. for the receipt of dividends, we do not believe that a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding of MBIA Insurance Corporation by the NYSDFS would have any significant long-term liquidity impact on MBIA Inc. or result in a liquidation or similar proceeding of MBIA UK or MBIA Mexico. An MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding could accelerate certain of the Company\u2019s other obligations and have other adverse consequences, such as the loss of control of MBIA Insurance Corporation and the imposition of unplanned expenses.\nIn addition to the Superintendent\u2019s authority to commence a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding, the Superintendent could, should the Superintendent find that the liabilities of MBIA Insurance Corporation exceed its admitted assets, use its authority under Section 1310 of the NYIL to order MBIA Insurance Corporation to cease making claims payments (a \u201c1310 Order\u201d). The issuance of a 1310 Order could result in material adverse consequences for MBIA Insurance Corporation, including that holders of some or all of the CDS insured by MBIA Insurance Corporation may potentially seek to terminate one or more of such swaps on the basis of such order (or the findings by the Superintendent underlying such order\u2019s issuance) and assert claims for market-based termination payments with respect to such terminations (which claims MBIA Insurance Corporation may not be able to pay).\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nMBIA Corp. insures certain transactions that continue to perform poorly, in particular RMBS transactions that include a substantial number of ineligible mortgage loans, and increased losses or a delay or failure in collecting expected recoveries may materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nMBIA Corp. insures certain structured finance transactions that remain volatile and could result in additional losses, which could be substantial, including RMBS, CDOs, CMBS pools and CRE transactions.\nWith respect to RMBS transactions, MBIA Corp. has recorded reserves on a number of transactions, in part due to ongoing poor performance of ineligible loans included in its insured second-lien RMBS transactions, including transactions where it has reached settlements with the sellers/servicers but continues to insure the transactions. Unpredicted losses on these transactions and in other transactions due to the inclusion of ineligible loans could occur. MBIA Corp. has also recorded significant loss reserves on its first-lien RMBS and CDO exposures, and there can be no assurance that these reserves will be sufficient, in particular if the economy deteriorates. These transactions are also subject to servicer risk, which relates to problems with the transaction servicer that could affect performance of the underlying assets. Furthermore, MBIA Corp. has recorded substantial expected recoveries on certain second-lien RMBS, and the timing and amount of those recoveries are subject to risk. Any delay or failure in collecting expected recoveries may materially and adversely affect MBIA Corp.\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2015, it recorded expected receipts of $406 million (on a present value basis) from excess spread (the difference between interest inflows on assets and interest outflows on liabilities) in our second-lien RMBS transactions, in reimbursement of our past and future expected claims. Of this amount, $382 million is included in \u201cInsurance loss recoverable\u201d and $24 million is included in \u201cLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves\u201d on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The amount of excess spread depends on future interest rates, borrower refinancing and defaults and mortgage insurance payments. There can be no assurance that this recovery will be received in its entirety or in the expected timeframe. In addition, the Company has recorded a recovery on a transaction containing ineligible loans securitized by Credit Suisse. The Company is pursuing recovery of its losses on this transaction in a litigation in which its assessment of the ineligibility of individual mortgage loans has been challenged by Credit Suisse, and there is no assurance that the Company\u2019s determinations will prevail, or that the Company will be successful in timely collecting its estimated recoveries. The litigation may take several years to resolve, during which time we will continue to be required to pay losses on the subject transaction, which may exceed the reserves established for the transaction.\nWith respect to insured CMBS pools and CRE CDOs, MBIA Corp. has experienced ratings erosion in the CMBS collateral underlying its insured static pools. Since 2013, MBIA Corp. has paid claims on a CMBS pool transaction which experienced deterioration such that all of the deductible was eliminated, and we expect to experience additional claims on this transaction in the future. Ultimate loss rates on these transactions remain uncertain. It is possible that MBIA Corp. will experience severe losses or near-term liquidity needs on its insured commercial real estate transactions, in particular if the economy does not continue to improve, there is a new recession, increased delinquencies, higher levels of liquidations of delinquent loans, or higher severities of loss upon liquidation.\nAn MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding could accelerate certain of the Company\u2019s other obligations and have other adverse consequences.\nMBIA Insurance Corporation faces a number of significant risks and contingencies, which could, if realized, result in MBIA Insurance Corporation being placed into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding by the NYSDFS. In the event of an MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding, the Company may be subject to, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nMTNs issued by GFL, which are insured by MBIA Insurance Corporation, would accelerate. To the extent GFL failed to pay the accelerated amounts under the GFL MTNs, the MTN holders would have policy claims against MBIA Insurance Corporation for scheduled payments of interest and principal;\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\n\u2022\nAn MBIA Insurance Corporation proceeding may accelerate certain investment agreements issued by MBIA Inc., including, in some cases, with make-whole payments. While the investment agreements are fully collateralized with high quality collateral, the settlements of these amounts could reduce MBIA Inc.\u2019s liquidity resources, and to the extent MBIA Inc. fails to pay the accelerated amounts under these investment agreements or the collateral securing these investment agreements is deemed insufficient to pay the accelerated amounts due, the holders of the investment agreements would have policy claims against MBIA Insurance Corporation;\n\u2022\nCDS counterparties may seek to terminate CDS contracts insured by MBIA Insurance Corporation and make market-based damage claims (irrespective of whether actual credit-related losses are expected under the underlying exposure), which claims could aggregate up to $185 million as of December 31, 2015;\n\u2022\nThe Company may be unable to carry out its tax planning strategies as a result of an MBIA Insurance Corporation proceeding. This may cause the Company to record allowances against a portion or all of its deferred tax assets. Refer to \u201cNote 11: Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. In addition, the Company currently files a consolidated tax return. An MBIA Insurance Corporation proceeding could result in challenges to the tax sharing arrangement among the MBIA affiliates that might adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to manage taxes efficiently;\n\u2022\nThe rehabilitator or liquidator would replace the Board of Directors of MBIA Insurance Corporation and take control of the operations and assets of MBIA Insurance Corporation (subject to, with respect to MBIA UK, regulatory oversight and related controls provided by the PRA and FCA, which would stay in effect following such occurrence), which would result in MBIA Inc. losing control of MBIA Insurance Corporation and possible changes to MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s strategies and management; and\n\u2022\nAn MBIA Insurance Corporation proceeding may impose unplanned costs on MBIA Inc. In addition, MBIA Insurance Corporation would be subject to significant additional expenses arising from the appointment of a rehabilitator or liquidator, as receiver, and payment of the fees and expenses of the advisors to such rehabilitator or liquidator.\nRevenues and liquidity would be adversely impacted by a decline in realization of installment premiums.\nDue to the installment nature of a significant percentage of its premium income, MBIA Corp. has an embedded future revenue stream. The amount of installment premiums actually realized by MBIA Corp. could be reduced in the future due to factors such as early termination of insurance contracts, accelerated prepayments of underlying obligations, commutation of existing financial guarantee insurance policies or non-payment. Such a reduction would result in lower revenues and reduced liquidity.", "PERMNO": 75175, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "MBI"}
