{"cik": "1303313", "company": "LHC Group, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could cause our actual results to differ materially from past or expected results and are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties that we have not predicted or assessed may also adversely affect us.\nIf any of the negative effects associated with the following risks occur, our earnings, financial condition or business could be materially harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline, resulting in the loss of all or part of stockholders\u2019 investments.\nRisk Factors Related to Reimbursement and Government Regulation\nWe cannot predict the effect that health care reform and other changes in government programs may have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe PPACA and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cActs\u201d) were signed into law by former President Obama on March 23, 2010, and March 30, 2010, respectively. The Acts dramatically alter the United States\u2019 health care system and are intended to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and reduce overall health care costs. The Acts attempt to achieve these goals by, among other things, requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, expanding Medicare and Medicaid eligibility, reducing Medicare and Medicaid payments, and tying reimbursement to the satisfaction of certain quality criteria. The Acts also contain a number of measures that are intended to reduce fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Because a majority of the measures contained in the Acts have either just recently or not yet taken effect, it is difficult to predict the impact the Acts will have on our operations. However, depending on how they are ultimately interpreted and implemented, the Acts could have an adverse effect on our business and its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe PPACA also amended the False Claims Act to provide that a provider must report and return overpayments within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or the claims for the services that generated the overpayments become false claims subject to the False Claims Act. Overpayments include payments for services for which the provider does not have proper documentation. If we were to identify documentation failures that could not be corrected, we could be required to return payments received for those claims within mandated time periods. If we fail to identify and return overpayments within the required time periods we could be subject to suits under the False Claims Act by the government or relators (whistleblowers).\nRegulations implementing the provisions of the PPACA and related initiatives may similarly increase our costs, decrease our revenues, expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct our business.\nIn addition, various health care reform proposals similar to the federal reforms described above have also emerged at the state level, including in several states in which we operate. We cannot predict with certainty what health care initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the state level, or what the ultimate effect of federal health care reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on us or on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to impacting our Medicare businesses, PPACA may also significantly affect our non-Medicare businesses. PPACA makes many changes to the underwriting and marketing practices of private payors. The resulting economic pressures could prompt these payors to seek to lower their rates of reimbursement for the services we provide.\nFinally, efforts to repeal or substantially modify provisions of the PPACA continue in Congress. The ultimate outcomes of legislative efforts to repeal, substantially amend, eliminate or reduce funding for the PPACA is unknown. In addition to the prospect for legislative repeal or revision, the President and members of his administration hostile to the PPACA could seek to impose substantial changes upon the PPACA through administrative action, including revised regulation and other Executive Branch action. The effect of any major modification or repeal of the PPACA on our business, operations, or financial condition cannot be predicted, but could be materially adverse.\nThere are continuing efforts to reform governmental health care programs that could result in major changes in the health care delivery and reimbursement system on a national and state level, including changes directly impacting the reimbursement systems for our home health and hospice care services. Though we cannot predict what, if any, reform proposals will be adopted, healthcare reform and legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows through decreasing payments made for our services.\nSignificant developments from the U.S. President could have a material effect on our business.\nOn January 30, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order entitled \"Reducing Regulation and Controlling\nRegulatory Costs\" that among other things, required that federal agencies cut two existing regulations for every new regulation they implement. The impact of any such changes to health care regulations on our financial performance and business prospects cannot be estimated at this time. It remains unclear what regulations might change, and whether any regulatory changes might affect, positively or negatively, our home health services, hospice services, home and community-based services, or facility-based services. Additionally, the Executive Order also prohibits the issuance of any new regulations not approved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda. Substantive changes to the regulations applicable to our business, in particular changes in compliance requirements or in reimbursement rates under Medicare, could have a material effect on our business and our financial performance.\nWe derive a majority of our consolidated net service revenue from Medicare. If there are changes in Medicare rates or methods governing Medicare payments for our services, or if we are unable to control our costs, our results of operations and cash flows could decline materially.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we received 63.5% and 65.4%, respectively, of our net service revenue from Medicare. Reductions in Medicare rates or changes in the way Medicare pays for services could cause our net service revenue and net income to decline, perhaps materially. See Part I, Item 1. Reimbursement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding reimbursements. Reductions in Medicare reimbursement could be caused by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nadministrative or legislative changes to the base rates under the applicable prospective payment systems,\n\u2022\nthe reduction or elimination of annual rate increases,\n\u2022\nthe imposition or increase by Medicare of mechanisms shifting more responsibility for a portion of payment to beneficiaries, such as co-payments,\n\u2022\nadjustments to the relative components of the wage index used in determining reimbursement rates,\n\u2022\nchanges to case mix or therapy thresholds,\n\u2022\nthe reclassification of home health resource groups or long-term care diagnosis-related groups, or\n\u2022\nfurther limitations on referrals to long-term acute care hospitals from host hospitals.\nWe receive fixed payments from Medicare for our services based on the level of care provided to our patients. Consequently, our profitability largely depends upon our ability to manage the cost of providing these services. We cannot be assured that reimbursement payments under governmental payor programs, including Medicare, will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Medicare currently provides for an annual adjustment of the various payment rates, such as the base episode rate for our home nursing services, based upon the increase or decrease of the medical care expenditure, which may be less than actual inflation. This adjustment could be eliminated or reduced in any given year. Also beginning on April 1, 2013 Medicare reimbursement was cut an additional 2% through sequestration as mandated by the Congressional Budget Act. Further, Medicare routinely reclassifies home health resource groups and long-term care diagnosis-related groups. As a result of those reclassifications, we could receive lower reimbursement rates depending on the case mix of the patients we service. If our cost of providing services increases by more than the annual Medicare price adjustment, or if these reclassifications result in lower reimbursement rates, our results of operations, net income and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, CMS proposed changes to the Home Health Prospective Payment System case-mix adjustment methodology through the use of a new PDGM for home health payments. This change was implemented on January 1, 2020, and also includes a change in the unit of payment from a 60-day payment period to a 30-day payment period and eliminates the use of therapy visits in the determination of payments. While the changes are intended to be implemented in a budget-neutral manner to the industry, the ultimate impact will vary by provider based on factors including patient mix and admission source. Additionally, in arriving at the calculation of a rate that is budget-neutral, CMS has made numerous assumptions about behavioral changes. The application of these assumptions could negatively impact our rates of reimbursement and have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation. Any changes in the laws and regulations governing our business, or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations, could require us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nAs a provider of health care services, we are subject to extensive regulation on the federal, state, and local levels, including with regard to:\n\u2022\nlicensure and certification,\n\u2022\nadequacy and quality of health care services,\n\u2022\nqualifications of health care and support personnel,\n\u2022\nquality and safety of medical equipment,\n\u2022\nconfidentiality, maintenance, and security issues associated with medical records and claims processing,\n\u2022\nrelationships with physicians and other referral sources,\n\u2022\noperating policies and procedures,\n\u2022\nemergency preparedness risk assessments and policies and procedures,\n\u2022\npolicies and procedures regarding employee relations,\n\u2022\naddition of facilities and services,\n\u2022\ncoding and Billing for services,\n\u2022\nrequirements for utilization of services,\n\u2022\ndocumentation required for billing and patient care, and\n\u2022\nreporting and maintaining records regarding adverse events.\nThe laws and regulations governing our operations, along with the terms of participation in various government programs, regulate how we conduct business, the services we offer, and our interactions with patients and other providers. See Part I, Item 1. Government Regulations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning applicable laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, and their interpretations, are subject to frequent change. Changes in existing laws, regulations, their interpretations or the enactment of new laws or regulations could increase our costs of doing business and cause our net income to decline. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal and state reimbursement programs.\nOn December 11, 2014, CMS proposed a star rating methodology for home health agencies to meet the PPACA\u2019s call for more transparent public information on provider quality. All Medicare-certified home health agencies would be eligible to receive a star rating (from 1 to 5 stars) based on a number of quality measures, such as timely initiation of care, drug education provided to patients, fall risk assessment, depression assessments, improvements in bed transferring, and bathing, among others. The \u201cQuality of Patient Care Star Ratings\u201d were first published in July 2015, and are updated quarterly thereafter based upon new data that is published with the ratings on the \u201cHome Health Compare\u201d section of the medicare.gov website. While we are pleased with the ratings received by our home health agencies and are striving to improve our results, failing to maintain satisfactory star rating scores could affect our rates of reimbursement and have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face reviews, audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies and private payors, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business.\nWe are subject to various routine and non-routine governmental reviews, audits and investigations. CMS engages third party contractors to conduct ADR and other third party firms, including ZPICs and RACs, to conduct extensive reviews of claims data and non-medical and other records to identify potential improper payments under the Medicare program. In recent years, federal and state civil and criminal enforcement agencies have heightened and coordinated their oversight efforts related to the health care industry, including with respect to referral practices, cost reporting, billing practices, joint ventures and other financial relationships among health care providers. Although we have invested substantial time and effort in implementing policies and procedures to comply with laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities arising from violations. A violation of the laws governing our operations, or changes in the interpretation of those laws, could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, and the termination of our rights to participate in federal and state-sponsored programs or the suspension or revocation of our licenses to operate. Our costs to respond to and defend reviews, audits, and investigations may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Moreover, an adverse review, audit, or investigation could result in:\n\u2022\nrequired refunding or retroactive adjustment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to the federal or state programs or from private payors,\n\u2022\nstate or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties, and other sanctions on us,\n\u2022\nloss of our right to participate in the Medicare program, state programs, or one or more private payor networks, or\n\u2022\ndamage to our business and reputation in various markets.\nThese results could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws that govern our employment practices. Failure to comply with these laws, or changes to these laws that increase our employment-related expenses, could adversely impact our operations.\nWe are required to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment, including occupational safety and health requirements, wage and hour requirements, employment insurance, and equal employment opportunity laws. These laws can vary significantly among states and can be highly technical. Costs and expenses related to these requirements are a significant operating expense and may increase as a result of, among other things, changes in federal or state laws or regulations requiring employers to provide specified benefits to employees, increases in the minimum wage and local living wage ordinances, increases in the level of existing benefits, or the lengthening of periods for which unemployment benefits are available. We may not be able to offset any increased costs and expenses. Furthermore, any failure to comply with these laws, including even a seemingly minor infraction, can result in significant penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, a number of states require that direct care workers receive state-mandated minimum wage and/or overtime pay. Opponents of such policies argue that the new protections will make in-home care more expensive for government programs that pay for such services, and that these new rules and regulations could result in a reduction in covered services. We will continue to evaluate the effect of these various new rules and regulations on our operations.\nCurrent economic conditions and continued decline in spending by the federal and state governments could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile our services are not typically sensitive to general declines in the federal and state economies, the erosion in the tax base caused by a general economic downturn has caused, and will likely cause, restrictions on the federal and state governments\u2019 abilities to obtain financing and a decline in spending. As a result, we may face reimbursement rate cuts or reimbursement delays from Medicare and Medicaid and other governmental payors, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse developments in the United States could lead to a reduction in federal government expenditures, including governmentally funded programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, if at any time the federal government is not able to meet its debt payments unless the federal debt ceiling is raised, and legislation increasing the debt ceiling is not enacted, the federal government may stop or delay making payments on its obligations, including funding for government programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Failure of the government to make payments under these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, any failure by the United States Congress to complete the federal budget process and fund government operations may result in a federal government shutdown, potentially causing us to incur substantial costs without reimbursement under the Medicare program, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Historically, state budget pressures have resulted in reductions in state spending. Given that Medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets, we can expect continuing cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services.\nIf any of our agencies or facilities fail to comply with the conditions of participation in the Medicare program, that agency or facility could be terminated from Medicare, which could adversely affect our net service revenue and net income.\nOur agencies and facilities must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the Medicare program. These conditions of participation vary depending on the type of agency or facility, but, in general, require our agencies and facilities to meet specified standards relating to personnel, patient rights, patient care, patient records, administrative reporting, and legal compliance. If an agency or facility fails to meet any of the Medicare conditions of participation, that agency or facility may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor. If that agency or facility then fails to institute a plan of correction to correct the deficiency within the time period provided by the state surveyor, that agency or facility could be terminated from the Medicare program. We respond in the ordinary course to deficiency notices issued by state surveyors and none of our facilities or agencies have ever been terminated from the Medicare program for failure to comply with the conditions of participation. Any termination of one or more of our agencies or facilities from the Medicare program for failure to satisfy the Medicare conditions of participation could adversely affect our net service revenue and net income.\nOn October 6, 2014, CMS issued a proposed rule that would revise the Medicare and Medicaid conditions of participation for home health agencies. The proposed rule would require home health agencies to develop, implement, and maintain an agency-wide, data-driven quality assessment and improvement program and a system of communication and integration to identify patient needs and coordinate care. The proposed rule also aims to clarify and expand current patient rights requirements and contains several other clarifications and updates largely focused on creating a more patient-centered, data-driven, outcome-oriented process for patient care. If the proposed rule is\nfinalized, we expect to face additional costs associated with compliance with such changes.\nOur revenue may be negatively impacted by a failure to appropriately document services, resulting in delays in reimbursement.\nReimbursement to us is conditioned upon providing the correct administrative and billing codes and properly documenting the services themselves, including the level of service provided, and the necessity for the services. If incorrect or incomplete documentation is provided or inaccurate reimbursement codes are utilized, this could result in nonpayment for services rendered and could lead to allegations of billing fraud. This could subsequently lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not covered, services provided were not medically necessary, or supporting documentation was not adequate. In addition, timing delays may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in achieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity. It is possible that documentation support, system problems, provider issues or industry trends may extend our collection period, which may materially adversely affect our working capital, and our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk.\nThe inability of our long-term acute care hospitals to maintain their certification as long-term acute care hospitals could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our LTACHs fail to meet or maintain the standards for Medicare certification as LTACHs, such as for average minimum patient length-of-stay and restrictions on sources of referral (e.g. the 25 Percent rule), they will receive reimbursement under the prospective payment system applicable to general acute care hospitals rather than the system applicable to long-term acute care hospitals. Payments at rates applicable to general acute care hospitals would likely result in our LTACHs receiving less Medicare reimbursement than they currently receive for their patient services. If any of our LTACHs were subject to payment as general acute care hospitals, our net service revenue and net income would decline. The 25 Percent rule is not applied to LTACH discharges occurring on or before September 30, 2018.\nThe implementation of patient criteria for our LTACHs under the BBA 2018 will reduce the population of patients eligible for LTACH-PPS and change the basis upon which we are paid which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe BBA 2018 created new Medicare criteria and payment rules for our LTACHs. Under these criteria, our LTACHs treating patients with at least a three-day prior stay in an acute care hospital intensive care unit and patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation admitted from an acute care hospital will continue to receive payment under the LTACH-PPS rate. Other patients will continue to have access to LTACH care, but our LTACH will be paid at a \u201csite-neutral rate\u201d for these patients, based on the lesser of per diem Medicare rates paid for patients with the same diagnoses under IPPS or LTACH costs.\nThe effective date of the new patient criteria was October 1, 2015, followed by a two-year phase-in period tied to each LTACH\u2019s cost reporting period. During the phase-in period, payment for patients receiving the site-neutral rate was based 50% on the current LTACH-PPS rate and 50% on the new site-neutral rate. For our two LTACHs that have a cost reporting period starting before July 1 of each year, the phase-in began on June 1, 2016. For our six LTACHs that have a cost reporting period starting on or after July 1 of each year, the phase-in began on September 1, 2016. As described in Part I, Item 1. Reimbursement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the BBA 2018 extended the site neutral phase-in period for an additional two years, based upon a 4.6% reduction in site neutral payments over seven years.\nWe continue to analyze Medicare and internal data to estimate the number of our cases that will continue to be paid under the LTACH-PPS rate. We estimate that approximately 40% of our LTACH patients will be paid at the site-neutral rate once the new criteria is fully phased-in. The site-neutral payment rates are based on the lesser of per diem Medicare rates paid for patients with the same diagnoses under IPPS or our LTACHs costs. There can be no assurance that these site-neutral payments will not be materially less than the payments currently provided under LTACH-PPS rates.\nThe additional patient criteria imposed by the BBA 2018 will reduce the population of patients eligible for LTACH-PPS rates and change the basis upon which our LTACHs are paid for other patients. In addition, the BBA 2018 will generate additional governmental regulations, including interpretations and enforcement actions surrounding those regulations. These changes could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, and the results of operations of our LTACHs.\nOur hospice operations are subject to two annual Medicare caps. If any of our hospice providers exceeds such caps, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOverall payments made by Medicare to each hospice provider number (generally corresponding to each of our hospice agencies) are subject to an inpatient cap amount and an overall payment cap amount, which are calculated and published by the Medicare fiscal intermediary on an annual basis covering the period from November 1 through October 31. If payments received under any of our hospice provider numbers exceeds either of these caps, we may be required to reimburse Medicare for payments received in excess of the caps, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the structures or operations of our joint ventures are found to violate the law, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nSeveral of our joint ventures are with hospitals and physicians, which are governed by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. These anti-kickback statutes prohibit the payment or receipt of anything of value in return for referrals of patients or services covered by governmental health care programs, such as Medicare. The OIG has published numerous safe harbors that exempt qualifying arrangements from enforcement under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. We have sought to satisfy as many safe harbor requirements as possible in structuring our joint ventures. For example, each of our equity joint ventures with hospitals and physicians is structured in accordance with the following principles:\n\u2022\nThe investment interest offered is not based upon actual or expected referrals by the hospital or physician.\n\u2022\nOur joint venture partners are not required to make or influence referrals to the joint venture.\n\u2022\nAt the time the joint venture is formed, each hospital or physician joint venture partner is required to make an actual capital contribution to the joint venture equal to the fair market value of his or her investment interest and is at risk to lose his or her investment.\n\u2022\nNeither we nor the joint venture entity lends funds to or guarantees a loan to the hospital or physician to acquire interests in the joint venture.\n\u2022\nDistributions to our joint venture partners are based solely on their equity interests and are not affected by referrals from the hospital or physician.\nDespite our efforts to meet the safe harbor requirements where possible, our joint ventures may not satisfy all elements of the safe harbor requirements. If any of our joint ventures were found to be in violation of federal or state anti-kickback or physician referral laws, we could be required to restructure them or refuse to accept referrals from the physicians or hospitals with which we have entered into a joint venture. We also could be required to repay to Medicare amounts we have received pursuant to any prohibited referrals, and we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal and state health care programs. If any of our joint ventures were subject to any of these penalties, our business could be materially adversely affected. If the structure of any of our joint ventures were found to violate federal or state anti-kickback statutes or physician referral laws, we may be unable to implement our growth strategy, which could have an adverse impact on our future net income and consolidated results of operations.\nThe application of state certificate of need and permit of approval regulations and compliance with federal and state licensing requirements could substantially limit our ability to operate and grow our business.\nOur ability to expand operations in a state will depend on our ability to obtain a state license to operate. States may have a limit on the number of licenses they issue. For example, Louisiana currently has a moratorium on the issuance of new home nursing agency licenses. We cannot predict whether the moratorium in Louisiana will be extended. In addition, we cannot predict whether any other states in which we operate, or may wish to operate in the future, may adopt a similar moratorium.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we operated in 16 states that require health care providers to obtain prior approval, known as a certificate of need or a permit of approval, for the purchase, construction, or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures, or to make changes in services or bed capacity. The failure to obtain any requested certificate of need, permit of approval or other license could impair our ability to operate or expand our business.\nQuality reporting requirements may negatively impact Medicare reimbursement.\nHospice quality reporting was mandated by PPACA, which directs the Secretary to establish quality reporting requirements for hospice programs. Failure to submit required quality data will result in a 2 percentage point reduction to the market basket percentage increase for that fiscal year. This quality reporting program is currently \u201cpay-for-reporting,\u201d meaning it is the act of submitting data that determines compliance with program requirements.\nThe Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the \u201cIMPACT Act\u201d) requires the submission of\nstandardized data by home health agencies and other providers. Specifically, the IMPACT Act requires, among other significant activities, the reporting of standardized patient assessment data with regard to quality measures, resource use, and other measures. Failure to report data as required will subject providers to a 2% reduction in market basket prices then in effect. Additionally, reporting activities associated with the IMPACT Act are anticipated to be quite burdensome.\nSimilarly, in the Calendar Year 2015 Home Health Final Rule, CMS proposed to establish a new \u201cPay-for-Reporting Performance Requirement\u201d with which provider compliance with quality reporting program requirements can be measured. Home health agencies that do not submit quality measure data to CMS are subject to a 2.0% reduction in their annual home health payment update percentage. Home health agencies are required to report prescribed quality assessment data for a minimum of 70.0% of all patients with episodes of care that occur on or after July 1, 2015. This compliance threshold increased by 10.0% in each of two subsequent periods - i.e., for episodes beginning on or after July 1, 2016 and before June 30, 2017, home health agencies must score at least 80%, and for episodes beginning on or after July 1, 2017 and thereafter, the required performance level is at least 90%.\nThere can be no assurance that all of our agencies will continue to meet quality reporting requirements in the future which may result in one or more of our agencies seeing a reduction in its Medicare reimbursements. Regardless, we, like other healthcare providers, are likely to incur additional expenses in an effort to comply with additional and changing quality reporting requirements.\nRisk Factors Related to Capital and Liquidity\nThe condition of the financial markets, including volatility and weakness in the equity, capital, and credit markets, could limit the availability and terms of debt and equity financing sources to fund the capital and liquidity requirements of our business.\nFinancial markets may experience significant disruptions, which could impact liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, significantly reducing the availability of certain types of debt financing. While we have not experienced any individual lender limitations to extend credit under our revolving credit facility, the obligations of each of the lending institutions in our revolving credit facility are independent and the availability of future borrowings under our revolving credit facility could be impacted by further volatility and disruptions in the financial credit markets or other events. Our inability to access our revolving credit facility or refinance the revolving credit facility would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nBased on our current plan of operations, including acquisitions, we believe our existing cash balance, when combined with expected cash flows from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet our anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. If our future net service revenue or cash flow from operations is less than we currently anticipate, we may not have sufficient funds to implement our growth strategy. Further, we cannot readily predict the timing, size, and success of our acquisition and internal development efforts and the associated capital commitments. If we do not have sufficient cash resources, our growth could be limited unless we are able to obtain additional equity or debt financing.\nThe agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains, and future debt agreements may contain, various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nThe agreement and instruments governing our revolving credit facility contain, and the agreements and instruments governing future debt agreements may contain various restrictive covenants that, among other things, require us to seek consent or comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios in order to:\n\u2022\nincur more debt,\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase stock, pay dividends or make other distributions,\n\u2022\nmake certain investments,\n\u2022\ncreate liens,\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates,\n\u2022\nmake unapproved acquisitions,\n\u2022\nenter into joint ventures,\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate,\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets, and/or\n\u2022\nmake fundamental changes in our corporate existence and principal business.\nIn addition, events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with and maintain such financial tests and ratios. Any failure by us to comply with or maintain all applicable financial tests and ratios and to comply with all applicable covenants could result in an event of default with respect to our revolving credit facility or any other future debt agreements. An event of default could lead to the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding loans and the termination of the commitments to make further extensions of credit. Even if we are able to comply with all applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to operate our business at our sole discretion could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities.\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect the local economies in which we operate or disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur operations along coastal areas in the United States are particularly susceptible to adverse weather events, such as hurricanes. Adverse weather events could disrupt our business and results of operations, result in damage to our properties, and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. Although we maintain insurance coverage, we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any losses or that we will be able to maintain insurance at a reasonable cost in the future. If our losses from business interruption or property damage exceed the amount for which we are insured, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe may be more vulnerable to the effects of a public health catastrophe than other businesses due to the nature of our patients.\nThe majority of our patients are older individuals and others with complex medical challenges, many of whom may be more vulnerable than the general public during a pandemic or other public health catastrophe. Our employees are also at greater risk of contracting contagious diseases due to their increased exposure to vulnerable patients. For example, if a flu pandemic were to occur, we could suffer significant losses to our consumer population or a reduction in the availability of our employees and, at a high cost, be required to hire replacements for affected workers. Accordingly, certain public health catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDelays in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems.\nOur business is characterized by delays in reimbursement, from the time we request payment for our services to the time we receive reimbursement or payment. Beginning in 2020, a portion of our estimated reimbursement (20% for existing home health providers) for each Medicare episode is billed at the commencement of the episode and we typically receive payment within approximately seven days. The remaining reimbursement is billed upon completion of the episode and is typically paid within 14 to 17 days from the billing date. If we have information system problems or issues arise with Medicare or other payors, we may encounter further delays in our payment cycle. For example, in the past we have experienced delays resulting from problems arising out of the implementation by Medicare of new or modified reimbursement methodologies or as a result of natural disasters, such as hurricanes. We have also experienced delays in reimbursement resulting from our implementation of new information systems related to our accounts receivable and billing functions.\nIn addition, timing delays in billings and collections may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in achieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity. It is possible that documentation support, system problems, Medicare, state Medicaid, or other payor issues, or industry trends may extend our collection period, which may materially adversely affect our working capital, and our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk. CMS's inability to have its systems ready to properly reimburse home health providers under the new PDGM could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn May 31, 2018, CMS issued a notice indicating its intention to re-launch a home health agency pre-claim review demonstration project. Now called the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services, the revised demonstration will give home health agencies in the demonstration states 3 options: (1) pre-claim review of all claims, (2) post-payment review of all claims, or (3) minimal post-payment review with a 25% payment reduction for all home health services. The demonstration initially will apply to home health providers in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas, with the option to expand after 5 years to other states in the Medicare Administrative Contractor Jurisdiction M (Palmetto). Compliance with this process could result in increased administrative costs or delays in reimbursement for home health services in states subject to the demonstration.\nChanges in units of payment for home health agencies could reduce our Medicare home health reimbursement levels.\nAs required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, the new PDGM will change the unit of payment for home health agencies from a 60-day episode of care to 30-day periods of care. This change was implemented January 1, 2020, and is stated to be\neffectuated in a budget-neutral manner, whereby the move to the PDGM is not supposed to result in lower net reimbursement. However, CMS has made assumptions about behavioral changes which have not been finalized or proven, for example that home health agencies will change their documentation and coding practices. CMS may take into account expected behavioral effects of policy changes related to the implementation of the proposed rule, resulting in lower reimbursement levels in some cases. Accordingly, the implementation of the PDGM could negatively impact our rates of reimbursement beginning January 1, 2020, and have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1, \u201cRisk Factors Related to Reimbursement and Government Regulation\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the PDGM.\nRisk Factors Related to Operations and our Growth Strategy\nWe could be required to record a material non-cash charge to income if our recorded goodwill or intangible assets are impaired.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of the assets on our balance sheet and are assessed for impairment annually or whenever circumstances indicate potential impairment. The goodwill assessment includes comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the assets assigned to the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit were to exceed our estimate of fair value of the reporting unit, we would be required to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities within the reporting unit to ascertain the fair value of goodwill. If we determine that the fair value is less than our book value, we could be required to record a non-cash impairment charge to our consolidated statements of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, debt covenants and ability to access capital.\nWe assess other intangible assets, such as trade names and licenses, at the applicable market or component level based on expected revenue and cash flows to be generated by those assets or collection of assets. Specific economic factors and conditions attributed to local markets or underlying agencies could cause these expected revenue and cash flows to decrease. If we determine that the fair value is less than the carrying value, we could be required to record material non-cash impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, debt covenants and ability to access capital.\nOur implicit price concessions may not be sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts.\nOn an ongoing basis, we estimate the amount of Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance receivables that we will not be able to collect. This allows us to calculate the expected loss on our receivables for the period we are reporting. Our implicit price concessions may underestimate actual uncollectible receivables for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in our estimates as a result of changes in payor mix and related collection rates,\n\u2022\ninability to collect funds due to missed filing deadlines or inability to prove that timely filings were made,\n\u2022\nadverse changes in the economy generally exceeding our expectations, or\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies.\nIf our implicit price concessions are insufficient to cover losses on our receivables, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in the case mix of patients, as well as payor mix and payment methodologies, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe sources and amounts of our patient revenue are determined by a number of factors, including the mix of patients and the rates of reimbursement among payors. Changes in the case mix of the patients, payment methodologies, or payor mix among private pay, Medicare, and Medicaid may significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nShortages in qualified nurses and other health care professionals could increase our operating costs significantly or constrain our ability to grow.\nWe rely on our ability to attract and retain qualified nurses and other health care professionals. The availability of qualified nurses nationwide has declined in recent years and competition for these and other health care professionals has increased and, therefore, salary and benefit costs have risen accordingly. Our ability to attract and retain nurses and other health care professionals depends on several factors, including our ability to provide desirable assignments and competitive benefits and salaries. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified nurses or other health care professionals in the future. In addition, the cost of attracting and retaining these professionals and providing them with\nattractive benefit packages may be higher than anticipated which could cause our net income to decline. Moreover, if we are unable to attract and retain qualified professionals, the quality of services offered to our patients may decline or our ability to grow may be constrained. In addition, if we expand our operations into geographic areas where health care providers historically have been unionized, or if any of our care center employees become unionized, being subject to a collective bargaining agreement may have a negative impact on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel and may increase our operating costs.\nIf we are required to either repurchase or sell a substantial portion of the equity interests in our joint ventures, our capital resources and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\nUpon the occurrence of fundamental changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our joint ventures, or if a substantial number of our joint venture partners were to exercise the buy/sell provisions contained in many of our joint venture agreements, we may be obligated to purchase or sell the equity interests held by us or our joint venture partners. In some instances, the purchase price under these buy/sell provisions is based on a multiple of the historical or future earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization of the equity joint venture at the time the buy/sell option is exercised. In other instances, the buy/sell purchase price will be negotiated by the joint ventures partners but will be subject to a fair market valuation process. In the event the buy/sell provisions are exercised and we lack sufficient capital to purchase the interest of our joint venture partners, we may be obligated to sell our equity interest in these joint ventures. If we are forced to sell our equity interest, we will lose the benefit of those particular joint venture operations. If these buy/sell provisions are exercised and we choose to purchase the interest of our joint venture partners, we may be obligated to expend significant capital in order to complete such acquisitions. If either of these events occurs, our net service revenue and net income could decline or we may not have sufficient capital necessary to implement our growth strategy.\nIf we are unable to maintain relationships with existing referral sources or establish new referral sources, our growth and net income could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on referrals from physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers in the communities in which we deliver our services. Our referral sources are not obligated to refer business to us and may refer business to other health care providers. We believe many of our referral sources refer business to us as a result of the quality of patient care provided by our local employees in the communities in which our agencies and facilities are located. If we are unable to retain these employees, our referral sources may refer business to other health care providers. Our loss of, or failure to maintain, existing relationships or our failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and operate profitably.\nWe face competition, including from competitors with greater resources, which may make it difficult for us to compete effectively as a provider of post-acute health care services.\nWe compete with national, regional, and local home nursing and hospice companies, hospitals and other businesses that provide post-acute health care services, some of which are large, established companies that have significantly greater resources than we do. We expect our competitors to develop joint ventures with providers, referral sources, and payors, which could result in increased competition. The introduction by our competitors of new and enhanced service offerings, in combination with industry consolidation and the development of strategic relationships by our competitors, could cause a decline in our net service revenue and loss of market acceptance of our services. Future increases in competition from existing competitors or new entrants may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share. Additionally, we compete with a number of non-profit organizations that can finance acquisitions and capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis or receive charitable contributions that are unavailable to us. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and competitive pressures may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nManaged care organizations and other third party payors continue to consolidate, which enhances their ability to influence the delivery of health care services. Consequently, the health care needs of patients in the United States are increasingly served by a smaller number of managed care organizations, and these organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers. Our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if these organizations do not contract with us as a provider and/or engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive providers. In addition, should private payors, including managed care payors, seek to negotiate additional discounted fee structures or the assumption by health care providers of all or a portion of the financial risk through prepaid capitation arrangements, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to react competitively to new developments, our operating results may suffer. State CON or POA laws often limit the ability of competitors to enter into a given market, are not uniform throughout the United States and are frequently\nthe subject of efforts to limit or repeal such laws. If states remove existing CONs or POAs, we could face increased competition in these states. There can be no assurances that states will not seek to eliminate or limit their existing CON or POA programs, which could lead to increased competition in these states. Further, we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may close additional underperforming agencies in the future.\nWe regularly review the performance of our various agencies. Our review considers the current financial performance, market penetration, forecasted market growth and current and future reimbursement payment forecasts. We will continue to monitor the performance of our agencies on an ongoing basis, and closures may from time to time occur in the future. If we take any further action to close agencies, we will incur additional costs and expenses, which may require us to record significant charges in future periods. While any such closures would be made in connection with our constant efforts to improve our profitability, associated charges would have a negative impact on our revenue and possibly our operating results during the short-term.\nFuture acquisitions may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities. Further, our acquisition and internal development activity may impose strains on our existing resources.\nOur growth strategy involves the acquisition of agencies throughout the United States. These acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees or patients of acquired agencies, the delay in payments associated with change in ownership, control, and the internal process of the Medicare fiscal intermediary, and the exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired agencies. Further, the financial benefits we expect to realize from many of our acquisitions are largely dependent upon our ability to improve clinical performance, overcome regulatory deficiencies, and improve the reputation of the acquired business in the community and control costs. We may not be able to fully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our current business structure in an efficient and cost-effective manner, having a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe generally structure our acquisitions as asset purchase transactions in which we expressly state that we are not assuming any pre-existing liabilities of the seller and obtain indemnification rights from the previous owners for acts or omissions arising prior to the date of such acquisitions. However, the allocation of liability arising from such acts or omissions between the parties could involve the expenditure of a significant amount of time, manpower, and capital. Further, the former owners of the agencies and facilities we acquire may not have the financial resources necessary to satisfy our indemnification claims relating to pre-existing liabilities. If we were unsuccessful in a claim for indemnification from a seller, the liability imposed could materially adversely affect our operations.\nIn addition, as we continue to expand our markets, our growth could strain our resources, including management, information and accounting systems, regulatory compliance, logistics, and other internal controls. Our resources may not keep pace with our anticipated growth. If we do not manage our expected growth effectively, our future prospects could be affected adversely.\nWe may face increased competition for attractive acquisition and joint venture candidates.\nWe intend to continue growing through the acquisition of additional home-based agencies and the formation of joint ventures with hospitals for the operation of home-based agencies. We face competition for acquisition and joint venture candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition and joint venture opportunities available to us or lead to the payment of higher prices for our acquisitions and joint ventures. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or joint venture opportunities in the future or that any such opportunities, if identified, will be consummated on favorable terms, if at all. Without successful acquisitions or joint ventures, our future growth rate could decline. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions or joint ventures, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nThe company may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger with Almost Family or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. The combined company may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the two businesses.\nThe ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on the combined company\u2019s ability to successfully integrate the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. As a result, the combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with the business practices and operations of Almost Family. The integration process may disrupt the\nbusiness of the combined company and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could adversely impact the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, loss of customers, and diversion of the attention of the combined company\u2019s management and employees. The challenges of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from the combination,\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems, including information technology systems,\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing effective uniform controls, standards, systems, procedures, and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies,\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the acculturation of employees,\n\u2022\ndifficulties managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company,\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers,\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting new joint venture partners and acquisition targets,\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel, including personnel that are considered key to the future success of the combined company, and\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping key business relationships in place.\nMany of these factors are outside of the control of the combined company, and any one of them could result in increased costs and liabilities, decreases in the amount of expected revenue and earnings, and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of our business and the business of Almost Family are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities, or cash flows that are expected, and the combined company will also be subject to additional risks that could impact future earnings. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business with the business of Almost Family. All of these factors could cause dilution of the earnings per share of the combined company, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger, negatively impact the price of the combined company\u2019s stock, impair the ability of the combined company to return capital to its stockholders, or have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the combined company.\nFederal regulation may impair our ability to consummate acquisitions or open new agencies.\nChanges in federal laws or regulations may materially adversely impact our ability to acquire home nursing agencies or open new start-up home nursing agencies. For example, CMS has adopted a regulation known as the \u201c36 Month Rule\u201d that is applicable to home health agency acquisitions. Subject to certain exceptions, the 36 Month Rule prohibits buyers of certain home health agencies - those that either enrolled in Medicare or underwent a change in ownership fewer than 36 months prior to the acquisitions - from assuming the Medicare billing privileges of the acquired agency. Instead, the acquired home health agencies must enroll as new providers with Medicare. As a result, the 36 Month Rule may further increase competition for acquisition targets that are not subject to the rule, and may cause significant Medicare billing delays for the purchases of home health agencies that are subject to the rule.\nPortions of our HCI segment compete in relatively new and developing markets, face larger more well-capitalized competitors, and rely on small numbers of relatively large customers.\nThe Company's HCI segment is used to report on the Company's developmental activities other than home health, hospice, HCBS, and facility-based services. The HCI segment includes (a) Imperium Health Management, LLC, an ACO enablement and management company, (b) Long Term Solutions, Inc., an in-home assessment company serving the long-term care insurance industry, and (c) certain assets operated by Advanced Care House Calls, which provides primary medical care for home-bound or home-limited patients with chronic and acute illnesses who have difficulty traveling to a doctor's office. Portions of our HCI segment compete in new and developing markets with new competitors or solutions developed and introduced to the market regularly. Such new products may capture market share more quickly or may have access to more capital than the capital we have allocated for such projects. Our efforts to bring new solutions to the market may prove unsuccessful, may prove to be unprofitable, or may prove to be costlier to bring to market than anticipated. Our investments in these activities are highly speculative in nature and subject to loss. Specifically, our assessment subsidiary competes with larger, better capitalized competitors, while also being particularly reliant on a small number of large customers, the loss of which could significantly and adversely impact its\nresults.\nWe have invested in development stage companies which may require further funding to support their respective business plans, which may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\nIn conjunction with the Merger, we obtained controlling interests in (a) Imperium Health Management, LLC, an Accountable Care Organization (\"ACO\") enablement and management company, (b) Long Term Solutions, Inc., a provider of in-home nursing assessments for the long-term care insurance industry, and (c) certain assets operated by Advanced Care House Calls, which provides primary medical care for home-bound or home-limited patients with chronic and acute illnesses who have difficulty traveling to a doctor's office. These investments are highly speculative, at risk and we may choose to make further investments, all of which may ultimately provide no return and could lead to a total loss of our investment.\nOur HCI segment provides strategic health management services to ACOs that have been approved to participate in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (\u201cMSSP\u201d). ACOs are entities that contract with CMS to serve the Medicare fee-for-service population with the goal of better care for individuals, improved health for populations and lower costs. ACOs share savings with CMS to the extent that the actual costs of serving assigned beneficiaries are below certain trended benchmarks of such beneficiaries and certain quality performance measures are achieved. In addition to our ownership interests in ACOs, we also have management service agreements with ACOs that provide for sharing of MSSPs received by the ACOs, if any.\nNotwithstanding our efforts, our ACOs may be unable to meet the required savings rates or may not satisfy the quality measures and efforts to drive other revenue may not cover operating costs of these investments. In addition, as the MSSP is a young program, it presents challenges and risks associated with the timeliness and accuracy of data and interpretation of complex rules, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to recoup any of our investments. Further, there can be no assurance that we will maintain positive relations with our ACO partners or significant customers, which could result in a loss of our investment.\nIn addition, CMS, the OIG, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Trade Commission, US Department of Justice, and various states have adopted or are considering adopting new legislation, rules, regulations and guidance relating to formation and operation of ACOs. Such laws may, among other things, require ACOs to become subject to financial regulation such as maintaining deposits of assets with the states in which they operate, the filing of periodic reports with the insurance department and/or department of health, or holding certain licenses or certifications in the jurisdictions in which the ACOs operate. Failure to comply with legal or regulatory restrictions may result in CMS terminating the ACO's agreement with CMS and/or subjecting the ACO to loss of the right to engage in some or all business in a state, payments fines or penalties, or may implicate federal and state fraud and abuse laws relating to anti-trust, physician fee-sharing arrangements, anti-kickback prohibitions, prohibited referrals, any of which may adversely affect our operations and/or profitability.\nIf we are subject to substantial malpractice or other similar claims, it could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe services we offer have an inherent risk of professional liability and substantial damage awards. At December 31, 2019, we have approximately 30,400 employees. In addition, we employ direct care workers on a contractual basis to support our existing workforce. We, and the nurses and other health care professionals who provide services on our behalf, may be the subject of medical malpractice claims. These nurses and other health care professionals could be considered our agents and, as a result, we could be held liable for their medical negligence. We cannot predict the effect that any claims of this nature, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees. We maintain malpractice liability insurance that provides primary coverage on a claims-made basis of $1.0 million per incident and $3.0 million in annual aggregate amounts. In addition, we maintain multiple layers of umbrella coverage in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million that provide excess coverage for professional malpractice and other liabilities. We are responsible for deductibles and amounts in excess of the limits of our coverage. Claims that could be made in the future in excess of the limits of such insurance, if successful, could materially adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, our insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates, in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms.\nFailure of, or problems with, our critical software or information systems could harm our business and operating results.\nWe depend upon reliable and secure information systems to provide valuable tools by which we manage our business, comply with legal requirements, provide services, and bill and collect for our services. In addition to our Service Value Point system, our business is also substantially dependent on non-proprietary software provided by third-party vendors. For example, we utilize third-party software information systems for billing and maintaining patient claim receivables.\nOur business also depends on a comprehensive payroll and human resources system for basic payroll functions and reporting, payroll tax reporting, managing wage assignments and garnishments. Our business also supports the use of Electronic Visit Verification (\"EVV\") to collect visit submission information through our delivery of HCBS, and we rely on third-party software vendors to provide continual maintenance, enhancements, as well as security of collected data. To the extent that our EVV vendors fail to support these processes, our internal operations could be negatively affected.\nOur agencies also depend upon our information systems for accounting, billing, collections, risk management, quality assurance, payroll, education tracking, and operational performance. If we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability, availability, or accuracy of our information systems, our operations and financial performance, and ability to report timely and accurate information, could be adversely affected.\nOur systems require constant maintenance, upgrades, and enhancements to preserve system capabilities and security and to meet our operational needs. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. Problems with, or the failure of, our information systems or software could negatively impact our clinical performance and our management and reporting capabilities. To the extent third-party software vendors fail to support our licensed software or systems, or if we lose our licenses, our operations could be materially and negatively affected. Any significant problems with or failures of our information systems or software could materially and adversely affect our operations and reputation, result in significant costs to us, cause delays in our ability to bill and collect from Medicare or other payors for our services, or impair our data capture, medical documentation, or ability to provide our services in the future. The costs incurred in correcting any errors or problems with our proprietary and non-proprietary software may be substantial and could adversely affect our net income.\nAdditionally, operations that we acquire must be integrated into our various information systems in an efficient and effective manner. For certain aspects, we rely upon third party contractors to assist us with those activities. If we are unable to integrate and transition any acquired business into our information systems, due to our failures or any failure of our third party contractors, we could incur unanticipated expenses, suffer disruptions in service, experience regulatory issues, and lose revenue from the operation of such business.\nOur information systems are networked via public network infrastructure and standards based encryption tools that meet regulatory requirements for transmission of protected health information over such networks. We have built redundancy into our networks and installed privacy protection systems on our network and point-of- care devices to prevent unauthorized access to proprietary, sensitive, and legally protected information. However, our technology may fail to adequately secure the confidential health information and personally identifiable information we maintain in our databases. Additionally, threats from computer viruses, instability of the public network on which our data transit relies, or other instances that might render those networks unstable or disabled would create operational difficulties for us, including difficulties effectively transmitting claims and maintaining efficient clinical oversight of our patients, as well as disrupting revenue reporting and billing and collections management, which could adversely affect our business or operations. If personal information or protected information of our patients, employees, or others with whom we do business is tampered with, stolen, or otherwise improperly accessed, we may incur fines and penalties associated with the breach of security or be required to take other action in response to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident, including under HIPAA or other judicial acts.\nOur information systems are also subject to damage or service interruption due to natural disasters, floods, fires, loss of power, loss of telecommunications connectivity, and other events that may be beyond our immediate control. While we maintain and test various disaster recovery plans and procedures, our failure to successfully implement and execute upon such plans and procedures, and restore the full operational capabilities of our information systems and software in an effective and efficient manner, could have a material adverse effect on the functionality of our information systems and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and cause a possible significant disruption of our operations and services.\nWe develop and maintain portions of our clinical systems in-house. Failure of, or problems with, these systems could harm our business and operating results.\nWe develop and maintain proprietary software systems to collect assessment data, log patient visits, generate medical orders, and monitor treatments and outcomes in accordance with established medical standards. These systems integrate billing and collections functionality as well as accounting, human resource, payroll, and employee benefits programs provided by third parties. Problems with, or the failure of, such technologies and systems could negatively impact data capture, billing, collections, and management and reporting capabilities. Any such problems or failures could adversely affect our operations and reputation, result in significant costs to us, and impair our ability to provide our services in the future. The costs incurred in correcting any errors or problems may be substantial and could\nadversely affect our profitability.\nOur ability to maintain the security of patient, employee, third-party, or company information could have an impact on our reputation, our financial position, and the results of our operations.\nWe have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to attempts of computer hacking, vandalism and theft, malware, computer viruses, ransomware, and other malicious codes, phishing, employee error and malfeasance, catastrophes, unforeseen events, or other cyber-attacks. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks or events. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of patient, employee, third-party or Company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. The proliferation of ever-evolving threats mean that we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any operations we acquire. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises, or misuses of data.\nA cybersecurity or ransomware attack or other incident that affects our information systems security could cause a security breach that may lead to a material disruption to our information systems infrastructure or business and may involve a significant loss of business or patient health information. If a cybersecurity attack or other unauthorized attempt to access our systems or facilities were to be successful, it could result in the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential information or intellectual property, and could cause operational or business delays that may materially impact our ability to provide various healthcare services. Any successful cybersecurity attack or other unauthorized attempt to access our systems or facilities also could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation or brand with our patients, referral sources, payors, or other third parties and could subject us to substantial sanctions, fines, and damages and other additional civil and criminal penalties under HIPAA, HITECH, the Omnibus Rule and other federal and state privacy laws, in addition to litigation with those affected.\nWe provide our employees with training and regular reminders on important measures they can take to prevent breaches or phishing schemes. However, given the rapidly evolving nature and proliferation of cyber threats, there can be no assurance our training and network security measures or other controls will detect, prevent, or remediate security or data breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access to, damage to, or interruption of our systems and operations.\nWe may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches, including unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information stored in our information systems, and the introduction of computer viruses or other malicious software programs to our systems, and cyber-attacks, email phishing schemes, malware, and ransomware. Moreover, a security breach, or threat thereof, could require that we expend significant resources to repair or improve our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. In the case of a material breach or cyber-attack, the associated expenses and losses may exceed our current insurance coverage for such events. Some adverse consequences are not insurable, such as reputational harm and third-party business interruption. Failure to maintain proper function, security, or availability of our information systems or protect our data against unauthorized access could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur failure to negotiate favorable managed care contracts, or our loss of existing favorable managed care contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOne of our strategies is to diversify our payor sources by increasing the business we do with managed care companies, and we strive to secure favorable contracts with managed care payors. However, we may not be successful in these efforts. Additionally, there is a risk that any favorable managed care contracts that we can secure may be terminated on short notice, since managed care contracts typically permit the payor to terminate without cause, typically on 60 days' notice. Such provisions can provide payors with leverage to reduce volume or obtain favorable pricing. Our failure to negotiate, secure, and maintain favorable managed care contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Related to our Ownership and Management\nAs a holding company, we have no material assets or operations of our own.\nWe are a holding company, whereby our material assets and operations are held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to service our debt, if any, is dependent upon the earnings from the business conducted by our subsidiaries. The distributions of those earnings or advances or other distributions of funds by these subsidiaries to us are contingent upon\nthe subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and are subject to various business considerations. In addition, distributions by subsidiaries could be subject to statutory restrictions, including state laws requiring that the subsidiary be solvent, or contractual restrictions. If our subsidiaries are unable to make sufficient distributions or advances to us, we may not have the cash resources necessary to service our debt.\nThe loss of certain executive management or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nOur success depends upon the continued employment of our executive management team and key employees and our ability to retain and motivate these individuals. If we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our business, achieve our business goals, or replace them with equally qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nOur executive officers and directors and their affiliates hold a substantial portion of our outstanding shares of common stock and could exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of the wishes of other stockholders.\nOur executive officers and directors and individuals or entities affiliated with them, beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 5.13% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2019. The interests of these stockholders may differ from other stockholders\u2019 interests. If they were to act together, these affiliated stockholders would be able to significantly influence all matters that our stockholders vote upon, including the election of directors, business combinations, the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and other significant corporate actions.\nCertain provisions of our charter, bylaws, and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nDelaware law and our governing documents contain provisions that may enable our Board of Directors to resist a change in control of us. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nstaggered terms for our Board of Directors,\n\u2022\nlimitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders,\n\u2022\nthe authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval,\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting for directors,\n\u2022\ndirector vacancies are filled by remaining directors (including vacancies resulting from removal), and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures required for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction to acquire us and may permit our Board of Directors to choose not to entertain offers to purchase us, even if such offers include a substantial premium to the market price of our stock. Therefore, our stockholders may be deprived of opportunities to profit from a sale of control. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors or cause us to take other corporate actions.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, our stockholders' ability to achieve a return on investment will depend solely on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not pay dividends on our shares of common stock and intend to retain all future earnings to finance the continued growth and development of our business and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, credit facility limitations, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nIf we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our business and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nWe are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Under Section 404, we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and report our conclusion in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to report its conclusion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could require us and our auditor to conclude\nthat our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. If material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our financial reporting, which could have an adverse effect on our business and price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90734, "SIC": 8082, "TIC": "LHCG"}
