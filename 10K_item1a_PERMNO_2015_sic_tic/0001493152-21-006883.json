{"cik": "1642375", "company": "Guardion Health Sciences, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in the Company\u2019s common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included or referred to in this Form 10-K, before purchasing shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. There are numerous and varied risks that may prevent the Company from achieving its goals. If any of these risks actually occurs, the business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline and investors in the Company\u2019s common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nAs the Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows since our inception, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to reach and sustain profitability. If it cannot, the Company will be required to secure additional financing, which the Company may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all.\nThe Company has incurred net losses since inception in 2009 and cannot be certain if or when the Company will produce sufficient revenue from operations to support costs. The Company had a net loss of $8,571,657 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and a net loss of $10,878,308 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $54,083,328 as of December 31, 2020. The Company expects to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flows in the near-term. At December 31, 2020, the Company had cash on hand of $8,518,732 and working capital of $8,021,152. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company sold an aggregate of 7,566,733 shares of its common stock for net proceeds of approximately $33,600,000 in two offerings, one completed in January 2021, and one completed in February 2021. In addition, in January and February 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,647,691 shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants and received cash proceeds of $3,608,509. Notwithstanding the net loss for 2020, management believes that its current cash balance, plus the net proceeds from issuance of common stock and exercise of warrants in January and February 2021, is sufficient to fund operations for at least one year from the date the Company\u2019s 2020 financial statements are issued.\nThe Company will continue to incur significant expenses related to commercialization of its products and with respect to efforts to build its infrastructure, expand its operations, and execute on its business plans. The Company may also utilize cash to fund acquisitions.\nEven if profitability is achieved in the future, the Company may not be able to sustain profitability on a consistent basis. The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company does not have any credit facilities as a source of present or future funds, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. The Company may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings and debt financings. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting the ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, would increase expenses and require that Company assets secure such debt. Moreover, any debt the Company incurs must be repaid regardless of our operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, operating performance and investor sentiment. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, the Company may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue our operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms, which would likely have a material adverse effect on its business, stock price and relationships with third parties, at least until additional funding is obtained. If the Company does not have sufficient funds to continue operations, the Company could be required to seek other alternatives that would likely result in our stockholders losing some or all of their investment.\nThe Company\u2019s future success is largely dependent on the successful commercialization of Lumega-Z\u00ae and GlaucoCetinTM medical foods, its line of nutraceuticals, the MapcatSF\u00ae medical device, and the CSV-1000 and CSV-2000 medical devices.\nThe future success of the Company\u2019s business is largely dependent upon the successful commercialization of its medical foods, nutraceuticals and medical devices. If the Company is unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to do so, it may be unable to successfully commercialize its products. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues the Company may be able to generate from sales. If this occurs, it will have an adverse impact on operations and the Company\u2019s ability to fund future development and commercialization efforts.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic could adversely impact our business, including the commercialization of our medicines, our supply chain, our clinical trials, our liquidity and access to capital markets and our business development activities.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization made the assessment that a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, can be characterized as a pandemic. The President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency and many states and municipalities in the Unites States have announced aggressive actions to reduce the spread of the disease, including limiting non-essential gatherings of people, ceasing all non-essential travel, ordering certain businesses and government agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations and issuing \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders which direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence (subject to limited exceptions). The effects of government actions and our policies and those of third parties to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact productivity and our ability to market and sell our products, cause disruptions to our supply chain and impair our ability to execute our business development strategy. These and other disruptions in our operations and the global economy could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe commercialization of our products may be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and actions taken to slow its spread. For example, patients may postpone visits to healthcare provider facilities, certain healthcare providers have temporarily closed their offices or are restricting patient visits, healthcare provider employees may become generally unavailable and there could be disruptions in the operations of payors, distributors, logistics providers and other third parties that are necessary for our products to be recommended and administered to patients.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities upon which we rely, or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt the supply chain for our products.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and actions taken to reduce its spread may also materially affect us economically. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread, the global credit and financial markets have recently experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. If the equity and credit markets continue to deteriorate, it may make any additional debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly or more dilutive. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, there could be a significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity and financial position or our business development activities.\nCOVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact the commercialization of our products, our supply chain, our access to capital and our business development activities, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the pandemic, the duration of the pandemic and the efforts by governments and business to contain it, business closures or business disruptions and the impact on the economy and capital markets.\nThe Company has limited experience in developing medical foods, medical devices and nutraceuticals and it may be unable to commercialize some of the products and services it develops or acquires.\nDevelopment and commercialization of medical foods, nutraceuticals, and medical devices involves a lengthy and complex process. The Company has limited experience in developing products and has only two commercialized medical food products on the market, Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin. The Company cannot assure you that it is possible to successfully commercialize the MapcatSF. The Company launched the CSV-2000 in Q1 2020, but there is no assurance the introduction of the instrument will be successful. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the NutriGuard nutraceuticals will be marketable or that the Company will achieve commercial success with the product line.\nEven if the Company develops or acquires products for commercial use, these products may not be accepted by the medical and pharmaceutical marketplaces or be capable of being offered at prices that will enable the Company to become profitable. The Company cannot assure you that its products will be approved by regulatory authorities, if required, or ultimately prove to be useful for commercial markets, meet applicable regulatory standards, or be successfully marketed.\nThe Company\u2019s ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt its current operations.\nThe Company has invested and expects to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. Such endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on the Company\u2019s investments, distraction of management from current operations, and unidentified issues not discovered in its due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause the Company to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe Company and its suppliers and manufacturers are subject to a number of existing laws, regulations and industry initiatives and the regulatory environment of the healthcare industry is continuing to change. If it is determined that the Company or its suppliers or manufacturers are not in compliance with the laws and regulations to which they are respectively subject, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs a participant in the healthcare industry, the Company\u2019s operations and relationships, and those of the Company\u2019s customers, are regulated by a number of federal, state, local, and foreign governmental entities with oversight of various aspects of product manufacture, distribution, sale, and use. The regulations are very complex, have become more stringent over time, and are subject to changing and varying interpretations. Regulatory restrictions or changes could limit our ability to carry on or expand our operations or result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales. The FDA and other federal and state governmental agencies regulate numerous elements of our business, including:\n\u25cf Product design and development;\n\u25cf pre-clinical and clinical testing;\n\u25cf labeling, and storage;\n\u25cf establishment registration and product listing;\n\u25cf product safety, including product recalls or other field-safety actions;\n\u25cf marketing, manufacturing, sales, and distribution;\n\u25cf premarket clearance or approval;\n\u25cf record keeping procedures;\n\u25cf advertising and promotion;\n\u25cf post-market surveillance, including reporting of adverse events; and\n\u25cf product import and export.\nWe may be subject to similar foreign laws that govern all of the above elements of our business, including pre-market and post marketing obligations for our medical foods and nutraceuticals. The time required to obtain authorization to sell our products in foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required by the FDA, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements. In the European Union (EU), member states are responsible for enforcing the EU\u2019s rules and for ensuring that only compliant products are placed on the market in their jurisdictions. Member states have powers to suspend the marketing and use, or demand the recall, of unsafe or non-compliant medical products. They also have the power to bring enforcement action against companies or individuals for breaches of the rules governing certain medical products.\nThe FDA, states, and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, state, or regulatory authorities, which may include the following:\n\u25cf untitled letters or warning letters;\n\u25cf fines, disgorgement, restitution, or civil penalties;\n\u25cf injunctions (e.g., total or partial suspension of production) or consent decrees;\n\u25cf product recalls, administrative detention, or seizure;\n\u25cf customer notifications or repair, replacement, or refunds;\n\u25cf operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf delays in or refusal to grant requests for future product approvals, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nAny of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFoods and nutraceuticals do not require premarket approval by FDA before they may be distributed in the United States (with limited exceptions). Unless an exemption applies, medical devices distributed in the United States must receive either premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, grant of a de novo classification request, or premarket approval of a premarket application before they may be commercially distributed. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes - Class I, Class II, or Class III - depending on the degree of risk associated with the device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Medical devices deemed to pose relatively low risk are placed in Class I, which generally do not require premarket notification or premarket approval.\nIn the US, the FDA and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) largely govern the promotion of food, supplements, and medical devices, and the Company\u2019s products must be promoted in compliance with the laws and regulations of these and other regulators. FDA defines a \u201cdrug\u201d as an article that is intended for use in the cure, treatment, prevention or mitigation of a disease. A medical food is defined as \u201ca food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.\u201d While the Company believes Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin are medical foods, if the FDA determines Lumega-Z or GlaucoCetin to be a drug, the Company and the product would be subject to considerable additional FDA regulation.\nThe Company believes the MapcatSF is classified as a Class I medical device that does not require premarket approval. The Company also believes the CSV-2000 is a Class I medical device that does not require premarket approval. If, however, the FDA were to determine that the MapcatSF or CSV-2000 is a Class II medical device, the products would be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including premarket approval.\nThe NutriGuard line of products are nutraceuticals and are regulated as dietary supplements under the Dietary Supplement, Health and Education Act of 1994 (\u201cDSHEA\u201d). DSHEA places dietary supplements in a special regulatory category under the general umbrella of \u201cfoods,\u201d with differing requirements from consumer food products and medical foods. Dietary supplements are supposed to enhance the diet and not be represented as a conventional food or as the sole item of a meal or diet. Nutraceuticals are not intended to cure or treat disease, but they may be intended to affect the structure or function of the body. Dietary supplements that contain structure/function claims on their labels must bear the disclaimer: \u201cThis statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\u201d The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and truthfulness of product claims; product claims are not approved by FDA. Dietary supplements also are subject to the Nutrition, Labeling and Education Act (\u201cNLEA\u201d), which regulates health claims, ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in a product.\nThe Company cannot anticipate how changes in regulations or determinations by regulatory agencies may evolve. Thus, application of many foreign, state and federal regulations to the Company\u2019s business operations is uncertain. Further, there are federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws and limitations on physician referrals and laws related to off-label promotion of prescription drugs that may or may not be directly or indirectly applicable to the Company\u2019s operations and relationships or the business practices of its customers. It is possible that a review of its business practices or those of its customers by courts or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that may adversely affect the Company. In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts existing operations or growth. The healthcare industry is expected to continue to undergo significant changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company cannot predict the effect of possible future legislation and regulation.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s good manufacturing practice regulations or fail to adequately, timely, or sufficiently respond to an FDA Form 483 or subsequent Warning Letter, this could impair our ability to market our products in a cost-effective and timely manner and could result in FDA enforcement action.\nThe FDA requires facilities that manufacture FDA-regulated products to comply with cGMP regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our product. The Company does not manufacture any of its products internally and instead relies on contract manufacturers to manufacture its products. We and our third-party manufacturers are required to comply with cGMP. The FDA audits compliance with cGMP and related regulations through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. The FDA may conduct these inspections at any time.\nThe Company may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions or other administrative actions if it is deemed to be promoting its nutritional or medical foods products as a drug, or if it\u2019s using false or misleading claims in its promotional materials.\nThe Company\u2019s business and future growth depend on the development, use and ultimate sale of products that are subject to FDA regulation. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, the Company is prohibited from promoting its nutritional and medical foods products for treatment of a condition or disease. Our promotional materials and marketing activities must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including laws and regulations prohibiting marketing claims that promote the off-label use of our products or that make false or misleading statements. FDA also could conclude that a performance claim is misleading if it determines that there are inadequate non-clinical and/or clinical data supporting the claim.\nThere is a risk that the FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities could determine that the nature and scope of our sales and marketing activities may constitute the promotion of our products for use as a drug in violation of applicable law, or that our promotional materials include false or misleading statements. The Company also faces the risk that the FDA or other regulatory authorities might pursue enforcement based on past activities that the Company discontinued or changed, including sales activities, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs and other activities.\nGovernment investigations are typically expensive, disruptive, burdensome and generate negative publicity. If its promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if the Company agrees to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, the Company would likely face significant fines and penalties and would likely be required to substantially change its sales, promotion and educational activities. In addition, were any enforcement actions against the Company or its senior officers to arise, the Company could be excluded from participation in U.S. government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nThe Company\u2019s products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent any required regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval.\nIf the Company\u2019s products, including Lumega-Z, GlaucoCetin or the NutriGuard line of products, are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, the Company may need to abandon its development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. The Company also may have to remove a commercialized product from the market as consequence of serious adverse events associated with the product. Any serious adverse or undesirable side effects identified during the development of the Company\u2019s products, could interrupt, delay or halt commercialization and/or could result in the additional regulatory requirements by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and in turn prevent the Company from commercializing its product candidates and generating revenues from their sale.\nA key part of the Company\u2019s business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and develop its product candidates. The Company may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships, which may significantly limit its ability to develop and commercialize its products successfully, if at all.\nA key part of the Company\u2019s business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and fund development of its product candidates. The Company is currently a party to several collaborative relationships.\nWhile the Company believes that these collaborative relationships help further validate our products, these relationships are not material to the Company because none of these relationships is exclusive, there are many potential collaborative partners available, and the Company and each collaborator is free to enter into other collaborative relationships as needed.\nThe Company may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all, and if it does enter into collaborations, these collaborations may not be successful. The Company\u2019s current and future success depends in part on its ability to enter into successful collaboration arrangements. If the Company is unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements, the Company may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of its product candidates, undertake development and commercialization activities at its own expense or find alternative sources of capital. Consequently, if it is unable to enter into, maintain or extend successful collaborations, the Company\u2019s business may be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s long-term success may depend upon the successful development and commercialization of products other than its current products.\nThe Company\u2019s long-term viability and growth may depend upon the successful development and commercialization of products other than its current line of products. Product development and commercialization is very expensive and involves a high degree of risk. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. Product development is a complex and time-consuming process. If the Company fails to adequately manage the research, development, execution and regulatory aspects of new product development it may fail to launch new products altogether.\nPatent litigation is common in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Any litigation or claim against the Company may cause it to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain on its financial resources, divert the attention of management from its business and harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nWhile the Company is not a pharmaceutical or a biopharmaceutical company, as a health sciences company, the Company\u2019s medical foods, nutraceuticals or its medical devices may come into competition with products in the medical foods and related industries, such as pharmaceuticals, biologics or dietary supplements. There has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights. For the most part, these lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability and infringement of patents. The Company expects it will rely upon patents, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position. The Company may find it necessary to initiate claims to defend its intellectual property rights as a result. Other parties may have issued patents or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of the Company\u2019s products or know-how or require the Company to license such patents and pay significant fees or royalties to produce its products. In addition, future patents may issue to third parties which the Company\u2019s technology may infringe. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which the Company is unaware that may later result in issued patents that the Company\u2019s products may infringe.\nIntellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If such a dispute were to be resolved against us, the Company may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees to the party claiming infringement if the Company were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent. The Company may also have to develop non-infringing technology, stop selling any products it develops, cease using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. The Company\u2019s failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm its business. Modification of any products the Company develops or development of new products thereafter could require the Company to become subject to other requirements of the FDA and other regulatory bodies, which could be time-consuming and expensive. In addition, parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent the Company from selling any products it develops, which could harm its business.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors may develop products similar to the Company\u2019s medical foods, medical devices and nutraceuticals, and the Company may therefore need to modify or alter its business strategy, which may delay the achievement of its goals.\nCompetitors may develop products with similar characteristics to our products. Such similar products marketed by larger competitors could hinder the Company\u2019s efforts to penetrate the market.\nMany large competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing experience and resources than we do and represent substantial long-term competition for us. Such companies may develop products that are safer, more effective or less costly than any that we may develop. Such companies also may be more successful than we are in manufacturing, sales and marketing.\nAs a result, the Company may be forced to modify or alter its business and regulatory strategy and sales and marketing plans, as a response to changes in the market, competition and technology limitations, among others. Such modifications may pose additional delays in achieving the Company\u2019s goals.\nIf the Company is unable to develop its own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or if it is not successful in contracting with third parties for these services on favorable terms, or at all, revenues from product sales could be limited.\nThe Company currently has a sales force consisting of a sales manager and four salespeople. To commercialize our products successfully, we have to develop more robust capabilities internally or collaborate with third parties that can perform these services for us. In the process of commercializing our products, we may not be able to hire the necessary experienced personnel and build sales, marketing and distribution operations capable of successfully launching new products and generating sufficient product revenues. In addition, establishing such operations takes time and involves significant expense.\nIf the Company decides to enter into co-promotion or other licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be unable to identify acceptable partners because the number of potential partners is limited and because of competition from others for similar alliances with potential partners. Even if we are able to identify one or more acceptable partners, we may not be able to enter into any partnering arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. If we enter into any partnering arrangements, our revenues are likely to be lower than if we marketed and sold our products ourselves.\nIn addition, any revenues the Company receives would depend upon our partners\u2019 efforts which may not be adequate due to lack of attention or resource commitments, management turnover, and change of strategic focus, further business combinations or other factors outside of our control. Depending upon the terms of our agreements, the remedies we have against an under-performing partner may be limited. If we were to terminate the relationship, it may be difficult or impossible to find a replacement partner on acceptable terms, or at all.\nProduct liability lawsuits against the Company could divert its resources and could cause it to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of Company products.\nWe face a risk of product liability exposure related to the use of our products, including Lumega-Z, GlaucoCetin and the NutriGuard product line of nutraceuticals. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we develop;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf loss of revenue; and\n\u25cf reduced time and attention of our management to pursue our business strategy.\nOur insurance policies may not fully cover liabilities that we may incur in the event of a product liability lawsuit. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nThe Company may be unsuccessful in expanding its product distribution outside the United States.\nTo the extent we continue to offer our products outside the United States, we expect that we may be dependent on third-party distribution relationships. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations. If distributors do not perform adequately, or we are unable to locate distributors in particular geographic areas, our ability to realize long-term international revenue growth would be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our products may require regulatory clearances and approvals from jurisdictions outside the United States. We expect that we will be subject to and required to comply with local regulatory requirements before selling our products in those jurisdictions. We are not certain that we will be able to obtain these clearances or approvals or compliance requirements on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe now sell our products to customers outside the U.S. and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations. As a result, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by location, include the following:\n\u25cf governmental laws, regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic and macroeconomic conditions, such as increases in taxes, austerity measures that may impact consumer spending, monetary policies that may impact inflation rates, currency fluctuations and sustainability of resources;\n\u25cf changes in environmental, health and safety regulations, such as the continued implementation of the European Union\u2019s REACH regulations and similar regulations that are being evaluated and adopted in other markets, and the burdens and costs of our compliance with such regulations;\n\u25cf increased environmental, health and safety regulations or the loss of necessary environmental permits in certain countries, arising from growing consumer sensitivity concerning the inclusion of flavor additives in food products and the fact that regulators perceive nutraceuticals, medical foods and functional food products as having medicinal attributes;\n\u25cf the imposition of or changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, by the U.S. or other Countries, which could adversely affect our cost or ability to import raw materials or export our flavors and fragrance products to surrounding markets;\n\u25cf risks and costs arising from language and cultural differences;\n\u25cf changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in the countries in which we operate, including the risk of expropriation or nationalization, and the costs and ability to repatriate the profit that we generate in these countries;\n\u25cf risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, bribery and corruption, anti-American sentiment, and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate;\n\u25cf difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained local personnel;\n\u25cf natural disasters, pandemics or international conflicts, including terrorist acts, or national and regional labor strikes in the countries in which we operate, which could interrupt our operations or endanger our personnel; or\n\u25cf the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights.\nManufacturing risks and inefficiencies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to produce products.\nWe engage third parties to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, while maintaining product quality, acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with regulatory requirements. In determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on historical experience, inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we require. If we are unable to obtain from one or more of our vendors the needed materials or components that meet our specifications on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products. While we have not arranged for alternate suppliers, and it may be difficult to find alternate suppliers in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us, we believe that there are multiple alternative sources, suppliers and manufacturers available for our products and devices in the event of a termination or a disagreement with any current vendor. Additionally, our supply chain may be jeopardized for a period of time due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information and expose it to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and business partners, including personally identifiable information of our customers, some of which is stored on our network and some of which is stored with our third-party E-commerce vendor. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our network and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe Company\u2019s products and facility and the facilities of its manufacturers are subject to federal laws and regulations and certain requirements in the State of California. Failure to comply with any applicable law or regulation could result in penalties and restrictions on the Company\u2019s manufacturers\u2019 ability to manufacture and the Company\u2019s ability to distribute products. If any such action were to be imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAlthough medical foods do not require pre-market approval by the FDA, manufacturers of medical foods and dietary supplements must be registered with the FDA under a provision promulgated by the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (the \u201cBioterrorism Act\u201d). Manufactures of medical devices also are required to be registered with the FDA. Manufacturers of FDA-regulated products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and state health authorities. The manufacture of our nutraceuticals, medical foods, and devices is outsourced in its entirety to three third-party manufacturers. We are evaluating additional manufacturers for selection as second source or back-up providers.\nOur products have not been reviewed by the FDA. There is no certainty that the FDA will favorably review our products or our manufacturers\u2019 facilities. If the outcome of an inspection is negative or if we or our manufacturers fail to comply with any law or regulation, we could be subject to penalties and restrictions on our manufacturers\u2019 ability to manufacture and distribute products. Any such action may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For a more complete discussion of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, see the section of this annual report titled \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s billings and revenues are derived from a limited number of customers and the loss of any one or more of them may have an immediate adverse effect on its financial results.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s billings were derived from a limited number of individual customers and distributors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had one customer who accounted for approximately 47% of the Company\u2019s sales; and during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had one customer who accounted for approximately 22% of the Company\u2019s sales. Customers may stop purchasing our products with little or no warning. Loss of customers may have an immediate adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf customers do not accept the Company\u2019s products or delay in deciding whether to recommend the Company\u2019s products and services, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur business model depends on our ability to sell our products. Acceptance of our products requires physicians to use our MapcatSF to measure the macular protective pigment in their patients\u2019 eyes, understand and appreciate the benefits of Lumega-Z and GlaucoCetin and nutraceuticals in order to recommend them to their patients, and to understand the benefits of visual acuity testing using the CSV-2000 device. We cannot assure you that physicians will integrate our products into their treatment plans or patient recommendations. Achieving market acceptance for our products and services will require substantial sales and marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry. If we fail to achieve broad acceptance of our products by physicians, and other healthcare industry participants or if we fail to position our products as an ocular health remedy, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf the Company is deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, it could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing its products and services.\nWe could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and if our products or the functionality of our products overlap with patents of our competitors. While we do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us or that those claims will be unsuccessful. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims whether or not such claims are ultimately successful. Furthermore, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. In addition, we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on its intellectual property rights, and if it is unable to protect them, its competitive position may suffer.\nOur business plan is predicated on our proprietary technology. Accordingly, protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position. Our goal is to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures. We generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology. We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position.\nOur success, competitive position, and future revenues will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes, and other technologies; to preserve our trade secrets; to obtain trademarks for our name, logo and products; to prevent third parties from infringing our proprietary rights; and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. To counter infringement or unauthorized use by third parties, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming.\nThe patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u25cf Claims of issued patents, and the claims of any patents which may be issued in the future and be owned by or licensed to the Company may be challenged by third parties, resulting in patents being deemed invalid, unenforceable, or narrowed in scope, a third party may circumvent any such issued patents, or such issued patents may not provide any significant commercial protection against competing products;\n\u25cf Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and many of which have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the United States or in international markets; and\n\u25cf The legal systems of some foreign countries do not encourage the aggressive enforcement of patents, and countries other than the United States may have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products. Thus, the Company\u2019s foreign patents may not be enforceable to the same extent as the counterpart U.S. patents.\nIn addition, the USPTO, and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or any of our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nThe Company must attract and retain quality management and employees in order to manage its growth. Failure to do so may result in slower expansion.\nIn order to support the growth of our business and the additional obligations that come with being an exchange-listed company, we will need to expand our senior management team and attract and retain quality employees. There is no assurance that we will be capable of attracting and retaining quality executives and integrating those individuals into our management system. Without experienced and talented management and employees, the growth of our business may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors may be impacted due to new state laws, including recently enacted gender quotas.\nIn September 2018, California enacted SB 826 requiring public companies headquartered in California to maintain minimum female representation on their boards of directors as follows: by the end of 2019, at least one woman on its board, by the end of 2020, public company boards with five members will be required to have at least two female directors, and public company boards with six or more members will be required to have at least three female directors.\nIn September 2020, California enacted AB 979, which requires that by the end of 2021 California-headquartered public companies have at least one director on their boards who is from an underrepresented community, defined as \u201can individual who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Alaska Native, or who self-identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.\u201d\nIn addition to that initial 2021 requirement, the law mandates that the number of directors from underrepresented communities be increased by the end of calendar year 2022, depending on the size of the board.\nIn addition, NASDAQ has proposed to adopt new listing rules related to board diversity and disclosure. If approved by the SEC, the new listing rules would require all companies listed on Nasdaq\u2019s U.S. exchanges to publicly disclose consistent, transparent diversity statistics regarding their board of directors. Additionally, the rules would require most Nasdaq-listed companies to have, or explain why they do not have, at least two diverse directors, including one who self-identifies as female and one who self-identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+.\nFailure to achieve designated minimum gender and diversity levels in a timely manner exposes such companies to financial penalties and reputational harm. We cannot assure that we can recruit, attract and/or retain qualified members of the board and meet gender and diversity quotas as a result of the California laws or future NASDAQ rules, which may expose us to penalties and/or reputational harm.\nOur acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.\nWe are regularly engaged in acquisition discussions with other companies and anticipate that one or more potential acquisition opportunities, including those that would be material or could involve businesses with operating characteristics that differ from our existing business operations, may become available in the near future. If and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available, we intend to pursue them actively. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including:\n\u25cf failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results, as well as the potential impairment of the acquired assets if operating results decline after acquisition;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25cf additional financing, if necessary and available, which could increase leverage and costs, dilute equity, or both;\n\u25cf the potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles;\n\u25cf difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u25cf initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire after the acquisition;\n\u25cf the high cost and expenses of identifying, negotiating and completing acquisitions; and\n\u25cf risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have faced, and expect to continue to face, intense competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit our ability to make acquisitions and may lead to higher acquisition prices. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, acquire or manage profitably any acquisition opportunity.\nIn order to expand the Company\u2019s business into additional jurisdictions, it may need to comply with regulatory requirements specific to such states and there can be no assurance that it will be able to initially meet such requirements or that it will be able to maintain compliance on an on-going basis.\nWhile we believe Lumega-Z\u00ae and Glauco-CetinTM to be medical foods and not drugs, they are only available under the supervision of a physician. While not available in pharmacies, we are mindful that the act of physicians prescribing, particularly if conducted across state lines, could potentially be subject to certain pharmacy regulations. Each state has its own regulations concerning physician dispensing, restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine, anti-kickback and false claims. In addition, each state has a board of pharmacy that regulates the sale and distribution of drugs and other therapeutic agents. Some states require a physician to obtain a license to dispense prescription products. While we do not believe these pharmacy requirements are applicable, should a pharmacy board or medical board determine otherwise, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the regulations of particular states into which we may expand or that we will be able to maintain compliance with the states in which we currently distribute our products. We currently have Lumega-Z customers in Alabama, Alaska, California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Mississippi, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Hawaii Malaysia and Alberta, Canada. Our inability to maintain compliance with the regulations of California and these other jurisdictions or expand our business into additional states may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFor distribution of products in Malaysia, China and throughout Asia, our nutritional compounds are affected by the regulatory agencies in each country. Each country has unique requirements related to the amount of ingredients allowed in the product and the labelling of each product. We believe that by obtaining regulatory approval in advance of marketing and distribution in each country, we will be protected from these regulatory restrictions affecting our ongoing operations. However, many factors can affect our ability to maintain compliance that are out of our control, including the availability of approved ingredients and sudden changes in regulatory restrictions imposed by each country.\nThe Company is subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If it fails to comply with these laws, it could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, be precluded from developing manufacturing and selling certain products outside the U.S. or be required to develop and implement costly compliance programs, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business (including in Malaysia) and may do business in the future, particularly as we expand our sales and operations to foreign markets. The Bribery Act, FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us, our officers, and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Compliance with the FCPA, in particular, is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nWe may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and we may participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. If we expand our operations outside of the U.S., we will need to dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate.\nIn addition, various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nWe may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The Securities and Exchange Commission also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions. Any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by U.K., U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Bylaws designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of state law actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nArticle XI of our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, or our Bylaws, dictates that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the sole and exclusive forum for certain state law based actions including certain derivative actions or proceedings brought on behalf of the Company; an action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by an officer, a director, employee or to the shareholders of the Company; any claim arising under Delaware corporate law; and any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws for which there is exclusive federal or concurrent federal and state jurisdiction.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Industry\nAny failure to comply with all applicable federal and state privacy and security requirements for the protection of patient information may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, Title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the \u201cHITECH Act\u201d), and related regulations promulgated by the Secretary (\u201cHIPAA Regulations\u201d) grant a number of rights to individuals as to their identifiable confidential medical information (called \u201cProtected Health Information\u201d) and restrict the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information. Failure to comply with these confidentiality requirements may result in penalties and sanctions. In addition, certain state laws may impose independent obligations upon us with respect to patient-identifiable medical information. Moreover, various new laws relating to the acquisition, storage and transmission of patient medical information have been proposed at both the federal and state level. These laws (collectively, the \u201cState and Federal Privacy and Security Laws\u201d) present different risks as to our sale of medical foods.\nWhen a physician recommends one or more of the Company\u2019s medical foods to a patient, the Company typically receives an order from the customer, but does not usually receive medical information. As part of the operation of its business, it is possible, however, that during communication with customers or with physicians the Company might receive patient-identifiable medical information. To the extent the Company obtains access to Protected Health Information, it must ensure it complies with the State and Federal Privacy and Security Laws. Any failure to comply may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect its results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with all applicable federal and state physician self-referral law (the \u201cStark Law\u201d) may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nCongress enacted significant prohibitions against physician self-referrals in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. This law and its supporting regulations, which have been amended and expanded substantially, are commonly referred to as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d and prohibit a physician from making any referral of a Stark Designated Health Service (\u201cDHS\u201d) to an entity with which the physician has any kind of financial relationship, unless all the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception are met. Stark covered DHS include both outpatient prescription drugs and diagnostic testing that are reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have similar laws, some of which can apply to all payors and not just governmental payors. While the Company believes that its arrangements with its customers are in compliance with the federal and any state Stark Laws, the Stark Laws present different levels of risks as to two of the Company\u2019s lines of business: (1) sale of the Company\u2019s medical foods and (2) sale of the Company\u2019s medical devices.\nMedical foods and medical devices are neither prescription drugs nor are they reimbursable under any federal program at present. Therefore, the Company believes that the federal Stark Law is not applicable. Further, the Company\u2019s believes that these products are also not covered under any potentially applicable state Stark Laws. The federal Stark Law, however, includes an exception for the provision of in-office ancillary services, including a physician\u2019s dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs, provided that the physician meets specified requirements. To the extent that the products might become reimbursable under a federal program, or otherwise become covered under the Stark Law, the Company believes that the physicians who use the Company\u2019s medical devices or recommend its medical foods to their patients are aware of these requirements. However, the Company does not monitor their compliance and has no assurance that the physicians are in material compliance with the Stark Law. If it were determined that the physicians who use the Company\u2019s medical device or prescribe medical foods purchased from the Company were not in compliance with Stark II, it could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with all applicable federal and state anti-kickback laws may result in fines and other liabilities, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and reputation.\nThe federal anti-kickback statute (the \u201cAKS\u201d) applies to Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal programs. AKS prohibits the solicitation, offer, payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referrals or the purchase, or in return for recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase, of goods, including drugs, covered by the federal health care programs. At present, the Company does not participate in any federal programs and its products are not reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or any other state or federal program. The AKS is a criminal statute with criminal penalties, as well as potential civil and administrative penalties. The AKS, however, provides a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory \u201csafe harbors\u201d for particular types of transactions. Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws and their own anti-kickback laws, some of which can apply to all payors, and not just governmental payors. While the Company believes that it is in material compliance with both federal and state AKS laws, the AKS laws present different levels of risks as to two of the Company\u2019s lines of business: (1) sale of the Company\u2019s medical foods, and (2) sale of the Company\u2019s medical devices.\nAt present, the Company\u2019s products are not reimbursable under any federal program. If, however, that changes in the future and it were determined that the Company was not in compliance with the AKS, the Company could be subject to liability, and its operations could be curtailed, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if the activities of its customers or other entity with which the Company has a business relationship were found to constitute a violation of the AKS and the Company, as a result of the provision of products or services to such customer or entity, were found to have knowingly participated in such activities, the Company could be subject to sanctions or liability under such laws, including civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as exclusion from government health programs. As a result of exclusion from government health programs, neither products nor services could be provided to any beneficiaries of any federal healthcare program.\nIncreased government involvement in healthcare could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nU.S. healthcare system reform under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and other initiatives at both the federal and state level, could increase government involvement in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the business environment of our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship. While no federal price controls are included in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act, any legislation that reduces physician incentives to dispense medications in their offices could adversely affect physician acceptance of our products. We cannot predict whether or when future healthcare reform initiatives at the federal or state level or other initiatives affecting our business will be proposed, enacted or implemented or what impact those initiatives may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship could react to these initiatives and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for our products. Additionally, government regulation could alter the clinical workflow of physicians, hospitals and other healthcare participants, thereby limiting the utility of our products and services to existing and potential customers and curtailing broad acceptance of our products and services. Additionally, new safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and corresponding exceptions to such law may alter the competitive landscape.\nRisks Related to The Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and it has elected to comply with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements which could make its common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we have elected to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which we refer to as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are only required to provide two years of audited financial statements. As a result of these reduced reporting and disclosure requirements our financial statements may not be comparable to SEC registrants not classified as emerging growth companies. We may be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the first sale our equity securities in a public offering (April 2019), although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, we would immediately cease to be an emerging growth company. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of our second annual report or the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other SEC registrants that are not emerging growth companies.\nInvestors may find our common stock less attractive as a result of our election to utilize these exemptions, which could result in a less active trading market for our common stock and/or the market price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future. Additionally, over the course of the past year, our shareholder base has increased in size due to the prevalence of new platforms and ease of access to stock trading brought on by new technologies. We may incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition, the recent outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused broad stock market and industry fluctuations. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf investor reaction to our business strategy;\n\u25cf investor reaction to our acquisition strategy;\n\u25cf the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf our continued compliance with the listing standards of NASDAQ;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, especially changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products;\n\u25cf actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our products, manufacturing process or sales and marketing terms;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf the success of our efforts to acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates;\n\u25cf developments concerning our collaborations or partners;\n\u25cf declines in the market prices of stocks generally;\n\u25cf trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of our suppliers or result in political or economic instability; and\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Further, recent increases are inconsistent with any improvements in actual or expected operating performance, financial condition or other indicators of value. Since the stock price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past, has been recently volatile and may be volatile in the future, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current prices or that future sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors.\nAdditionally, recently, securities of certain companies have experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. While we have no reason to believe our shares would be the target of a short squeeze, there can be no assurance that we won\u2019t be in the future, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.\nThe Company does not intend to pay cash dividends to its stockholders, so you may not receive any return on your investment in the Company prior to selling your interest in the Company.\nWe have never paid any dividends to our common stockholders and do not foresee doing so as a public company. We currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and, therefore, do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If we determine that we will pay cash dividends to the holders of our common stock, we cannot assure that such cash dividends will be paid on a timely basis. The success of your investment in the Company will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation. As a result, you will not receive any return on your investment prior to selling your shares in our Company and, for the other reasons discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, you may not receive any return on your investment even when you sell your shares in our Company.\nThe Company may require additional capital in the future to support its operations, and this capital has not always been readily available.\nWe may require additional debt or equity financing to fund our operations, including, but not limited to, working capital. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business model and future prospects. Accordingly, investors should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development, as we have, in fact, encountered. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a new company with a limited operating history and with limited funds, will face. In particular, while we do not have current plans to re-prioritize our business plan, potential investors should consider that there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:\n\u25cf implement or execute our current business plan, which may or may not be sound;\n\u25cf maintain our anticipated management and advisory team;\n\u25cf raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to effectuate our business plan; and\n\u25cf identify, acquire or successfully integrate any acquisition candidate.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our existing capital stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our current operations and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited. If we cannot access the capital necessary to support our business, we would be forced to curtail our business activities or even shut down operations. If we cannot execute any one of the foregoing or similar matters relating to our business, the business may fail, in which case you would lose the entire amount of your investment in the Company.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could cause our investors to lose confidence in us and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If our internal controls are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. As discussed in Item 9A - \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K, we have re-evaluated our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they were not effective as of December 31, 2020.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness we identified was inadequate segregation of duties within accounting processes.\nThe Company is committed to remediating its material weaknesses as promptly as possible. Implementation of the Company\u2019s remediation plans has commenced and is being overseen by the audit committee. However, there can be no assurance as to when these material weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Any failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or the development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of its common stock.\nOn September 20, 2019, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications staff (the \u201cStaff\u201d) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer satisfied the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cBid Price Rule\u201d).\nIn accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company was afforded 180 days, or until March 18, 2020, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by evidence of a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. Thereafter, the Company had been afforded a second 180-calendar day compliance period (which 180-day period was extended due to circumstances related to COVID-19), or until November 30, 2020, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule.\nThe Company was unable to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by November 30, 2020. Accordingly, on December 1, 2020, the Company received a letter from the Staff notifying it that its Common Stock would be subject to delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company timely appealed Nasdaq\u2019s determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d). The Company timely appealed Nasdaq\u2019s determination to the Panel.\nOn January 26, 2021, the Company received written notification that the Panel granted the Company an extension for continued listing through March 15, 2021.\nOn March 1, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effectuate a one-for-six (1:6) reverse stock split (the \u201cReverse Stock Split\u201d) of its common stock without any change to its par value. Proportional adjustments for the Reverse Stock Split were made to the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock, stock options, and warrants as if the split occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented in this Annual Report.\nOn March 15, 2021, we received a letter from the Staff notifying us that we had regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule. The letter stated the staff had determined that for the prior 10 consecutive business days the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock had been at $1.00 per share or greater and that accordingly, the Company had regained compliance under the Bid Price Rule, and that the matter was now closed.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq in the future, including the Bid Price Rule, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. A delisting would adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume and likely the price of our common stock, causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the purchase price.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf changes in our industry;\n\u25cf competitive pricing pressures;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf operating results that fall below expectations; and\n\u25cf regulatory developments;\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 18555, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "GHSI"}
