{"cik": "935494", "company": "NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. The vast majority of our sales outside of North America are denominated in local currencies, and accordingly, the U.S. dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates. (See Financial Risk Management under Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for further discussion on the effect changes in the foreign currency exchange rates have on our operating results.)\nDuring 2014, there was sharp volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and most of the major currencies in the markets in which we do business. Toward the end of 2014 and in January of 2015, we saw a sharp and broad appreciation of the U.S. dollar against many of the currencies we do business in bringing the U.S. dollar index to a ten year high. We expect the strength of the U.S. dollar to have a negative impact on the U.S. dollar equivalent of our foreign currency denominated sales. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect the strong U.S. dollar will reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent of our foreign currency denominated sales by approximately 5%. We are also concerned about the current negotiations between Greece and other members of the eurozone regarding the terms of the Greek bailout. Any outcome of these negotiations that leads to a default of Greece\u2019s debt or an exit by any member from the eurozone could result in a significant adverse impact on the financial markets throughout Europe and as a result could have material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations.\nWe cannot predict to what degree or how long this volatility in the foreign currency exchange markets will continue. In the past, we have noted that significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates in the markets in which we do business has had a significant impact on the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated firm commitments, on our ability to forecast our U.S. dollar equivalent revenues and expenses and on the effectiveness of our hedging programs. In the past, these dynamics have also adversely affected our revenue growth in international markets and may pose similar challenges in the future. We recognize the local currency as the functional currency in virtually all of our international subsidiaries.\nUncertain Global Economic Conditions Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations. Our operations and performance are sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions, both in the U.S. and globally. We continue to see the adverse impact of the sanctions against Russia by the European Union (EU) and the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2014, orders in our Emerging Markets region decreased by 2%, year over year, driven in large part by a sharp decline in orders in Russia. The ongoing uncertainty created by volatile currency markets, the impact of the sanctions against Russia and declining oil prices, alone or in combination, may continue to have a material adverse effect on our revenues and the financial results of our operations. In addition, we remain concerned about the geopolitical instability in the Middle East as well as the continued volatility of the equity markets. These factors as well as others we may not contemplate could have a material adverse effect on the spending patterns of businesses including our current and potential customers which could have a material adverse effect our revenues and our results of operations. Other factors that could adversely influence demand for our products include declining oil prices, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer and business confidence, and other macroeconomic factors that could have a negative impact on capital investment and spending behavior.\nHistorically, our business cycles have generally followed the expansion and contraction cycles in the global industrial economy as measured by the PMI. In the three months ended December 31, 2014, the average of the PMI was 51.9 and the average of the new order element of the PMI was 52.4, both indicating economic expansion. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, the PMI in the U.S. and the Eurozone maintained readings above 50. The average of the global PMI during 2014 was 52.4 compared to an average of 51.5 during 2013. While this is an indication of overall improvement in the economic climate for the broad industrial economy, we remain concerned with other economic and political events as we begin 2015. We are unable to predict whether the industrial economy, as measured by the PMI, will remain above the neutral reading of 50, strengthen or contract during 2015. If the industrial economy as measured by the PMI begins to contract, it could have an adverse effect on the spending patterns of businesses including our current and potential customers which could adversely affect our revenues and result of operations.\nRevenue Derived from Large Orders Could Adversely Affect our Gross Margin and Could Lead to Greater Variability in our Quarterly Results. We define our large order business as orders with a value greater than $100,000. As a percent of our overall business, orders over $100,000 represented 22%, 21%, and 21% of our total orders during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. These orders may be more sensitive to changes in the global industrial economy, may be subject to greater discount variability, lower gross margins, and may contract at a faster pace during an economic downturn. Excluding the impact of our largest customer, large orders increased by 9%, 19%, and 23% in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Historically, our gross margins have been relatively stable from period to period. To the extent that the amount of our revenue derived from larger orders increases in future periods, either in absolute dollars or as a percentage of our overall business, our gross margins could decline, and we could experience greater volatility and see a greater negative impact from future downturns in the global industrial economy. This dynamic may also have an adverse effect on the historical seasonal pattern of our revenues and our results of operations. These types of orders also make managing inventory levels more difficult as we have in the past and may have to in the future build large quantities of inventory in anticipation of future demand that may not materialize.\nOrders With a Value of Greater than One Million Dollars Expose Us to Significant Additional Business and Legal Risks that Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition. In recent years, we have made a concentrated effort to increase our revenue through the pursuit of orders with a value greater than $1.0 million. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we received $60 million, $37 million, and $76 million, respectively, in new orders from our largest customer. In the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we recognized net revenue of $52 million, $35 million, and $68 million, respectively, from these orders. These types of orders expose us to significant additional business and legal risks compared to smaller orders. Our very large customers frequently require contract terms that vary substantially from our standard terms of sale. These orders can be accompanied by critical delivery commitments and severe contractual liabilities can be imposed on us if we fail to provide the quantity of product at the required delivery times. These customers may also impose product acceptance requirements and product performance evaluations which create uncertainty with respect to the timing of our ability to recognize revenue from such orders. In addition, these larger orders are more volatile, are subject to greater discount variability and may contract at a faster pace during an economic downturn. These contracts may also have supply constraint requirements which mandate that we allocate large product inventories for a specific contract. These inventory requirements expose us to higher risks of inventory obsolescence and can adversely impact our ability to provide adequate product supply to other customers.\nFulfillment of these contracts can severely challenge our supply chain capabilities at the component acquisition, assembly and delivery stages. Our contracts with such customers may allow the customer to cancel or delay orders without liability which exposes our business and financial results to significant risk. These contracts can require us to develop specific product mitigation plans for product delivery constraints caused by unexpected or catastrophic situations to help assure quick production recovery. We can attempt to manage this risk but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts. These customers may demand most favored customer pricing, significant discounts, extended payment terms and volume rebates and such terms can adversely impact our revenues, margins and financial results and may also negatively impact our days sales outstanding to the extent these orders become a larger proportion of our overall revenue. These customers may request broad indemnity obligations and large direct and consequential damage provisions in the event their contracts with us are breached, and these provisions may expose us to risk and liabilities in excess of our standard terms and conditions of sale. While we attempt to limit the number of contracts that contain the non-standard terms of sale described above and attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts, we have been and expect to be required to agree to some or all of such provisions to secure these customers and to continue to grow our business. Such actions expose us to significant additional risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Product Revenues are Dependent on Certain Industries and Contractions in these Industries Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Results of Operations. Sales of our products are dependent on customers in certain industries, particularly the telecommunications, semiconductor, consumer electronics, automotive, energy, automated test equipment, defense and aerospace industries. As we have experienced in the past, and as we may continue to experience in the future, downturns characterized by diminished product demand in any one or more of these industries may result in decreased sales, and a material adverse effect on our operating results. We cannot predict when and to what degree contractions in these industries may occur, however any sharp or prolonged contraction in one or more of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are Subject to Various Risks Associated with International Operations and Foreign Economies. Our international sales are subject to inherent risks, including:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties and the high tax costs associated with the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in local economies;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\ngreater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;\n\u00b7\ncosts and risks of localizing products for foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ntariffs and other trade barriers; and,\n\u00b7 the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.\nIn many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies. Any violation of foreign or U.S. laws by our employees, contractors or agents, even if such violation is prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We must also comply with various import and export regulations. The application of these various regulations depends on the classification of our products which can change over time as such regulations are modified or interpreted. As a result, even if we are currently in compliance with applicable regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not have to incur additional costs or take additional compliance actions in the future. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or termination of import and export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally, the regulatory environment in some countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the U.S. dollar.\nOur Current Domestic Cash Position May Not Be Sufficient to Fund our Domestic Cash Needs in the Next Twelve Months and We May Need to Borrow Under our Credit Agreement, Seek Funding from External Sources or Repatriate Foreign Earnings. At December 31, 2014, we had $471 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of which $380 million was held in operating and investment accounts of our foreign subsidiaries. On May 9, 2013, we entered into a Loan Agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Loan Agreement provides for a $50 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a scheduled maturity date of May 9, 2018 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d). Proceeds of loans made under the Loan Agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may choose to borrow funds against this line of credit in future periods in order to have sufficient domestic cash to fund continued dividends to our stockholders, to fund potential acquisitions, to purchase shares under our board authorized share repurchase program or other domestic general corporate purposes without the need to repatriate foreign earnings. Future dividends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, and our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any amounts outstanding or due as a result of borrowings under this line of credit.\nWe may also seek to pursue additional financing or to raise additional funds by selling equity or debt to the public or in private transactions. If we elect to raise additional funds, we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of our existing stockholders would be reduced. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. We may also choose to repatriate foreign earnings which would be subject to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% and therefore, would likely have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and on our net income and earnings per share. We could also choose to reduce certain expenditures or payments of dividends or suspend our program to repurchase shares of our common stock. Historically, we have not had to rely on debt, public or private, to fund our operating, financing or investing activities.\nOur Success Depends on New Product Introductions and Market Acceptance of Our Products. The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs and frequent new product introductions, and is therefore highly dependent upon timely product innovation. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products, and on increasing penetration in domestic and international markets. As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, we have experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products. Any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of a product and other related products and could impede continued sales of predecessor products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. There can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce new products in accordance with announced release dates, that our new products will achieve market acceptance or that any such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period. Failure of our new products to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Moreover, there can be no assurance that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our efforts to increase foreign market penetration.\nWe Operate in Intensely Competitive Markets. The markets in which we operate are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors, some of which are divisions of large corporations having far greater resources than we have, and we may face further competition from new market entrants in the future. A key competitor is Keysight Technologies Inc. (\u201cKeysight\u201d) which was formerly part of Agilent. In 2013, Agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies; one in life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets that would retain the Agilent name and Keysight that would concentrate solely on the test and measurement industry. Agilent completed the spin off of Keysight in November 2014. Keysight offers hardware and software products that provide solutions that directly compete with our virtual instrumentation products including its own line of PXI based hardware. Keysight is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with our products. Because of Keysight\u2019s strong position in the instrumentation business, changes in its marketing strategy or product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe believe our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control, including:\n\u00b7\ngeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain and grow our business with our largest customer;\n\u00b7\nour ability to meet the volume and service requirements of our very large customers;\n\u00b7\nindustry consolidation, including acquisitions by our competitors;\n\u00b7\ncapacity utilization and the efficiency of manufacturing operations;\n\u00b7\nsuccess in developing new products;\n\u00b7\ntiming of our new product introductions;\n\u00b7\nnew product introductions by competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of competitors to more fully leverage low cost geographies for manufacturing and/or distribution;\n\u00b7\nproduct pricing;\n\u00b7\neffectiveness of sales and marketing resources and strategies;\n\u00b7\nadequate manufacturing capacity and supply of components and materials;\n\u00b7\nstrategic relationships with our suppliers;\n\u00b7\nproduct quality and performance;\n\u00b7\nprotection of our products by effective use of intellectual property laws;\n\u00b7\nthe financial strength of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe outcome of any future litigation or commercial dispute;\n\u00b7\nbarriers to entry imposed by competitors with significant market power in new markets; and,\n\u00b7\ngovernment actions throughout the world.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.\nWe Have Established a Budget and Variations From Our Budget Will Affect Our Financial Results. We have an operating budget for 2015. Our budget was established based on the estimated revenue from sales of our products which are based on anticipated economic conditions in the markets in which we do business as well as the timing and volume of our new products and the expected penetration of both new and existing products in the marketplace. If demand for our products in 2015 is less than the demand we anticipated in setting our 2015 budget, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nIf we exceed our budgeted level of expenses or if we cannot reduce expenditures in response to a decrease in revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our spending could exceed our budget due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nunanticipated foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nless than expected capacity utilization of our new manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia;\n\u00b7\nincreased manufacturing costs resulting from component supply shortages or component price fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nadditional marketing costs for new product introductions or for conferences and tradeshows;\n\u00b7\nthe timing, cost or outcome of any future intellectual property litigation or commercial disputes;\n\u00b7\nincreased component costs resulting from vendors increasing their sales price; or\n\u00b7\nadditional costs related to acquisitions, if any.\nOur Quarterly Results are Subject to Fluctuations Due to Various Factors that May Adversely Affect Our Business and Result of Operations. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the global economy or global credit markets;\n\u00b7\nincreasing concentration in the amount of revenue derived from very large orders and the pricing, margins, and other terms of such orders;\n\u00b7\nchanges in capacity utilization including at our new facility in Malaysia;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the mix of products sold;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and pricing of components from third parties (especially limited sources);\n\u00b7\nthe difficulty in maintaining margins, including the higher margins traditionally achieved in international sales;\n\u00b7\nchanges in pricing policies by us, our competitors or suppliers;\n\u00b7\nthe timing, cost or outcome of any future intellectual property litigation or commercial disputes;\n\u00b7\ndelays in product shipments caused by human error or other factors; and,\n\u00b7\ndisruptions in transportation channels.\nOur Revenues are Subject to Seasonal Variations. In previous years, our revenues have been characterized by seasonality, with revenues typically growing from the first quarter to the second quarter, being relatively constant from the second quarter to the third quarter, growing in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and declining in the first quarter of the following year from the fourth quarter of the preceding year. This historical trend has been affected and may continue to be affected in the future by broad fluctuations in the global industrial economy as well as the timing of new product introductions or any acquisitions. In addition, revenue derived from very large orders, including those from our largest customer, have had a significant impact on our historical seasonal trends as these orders may be more sensitive to changes in the global industrial economy, may be subject to greater volatility in timing and amount, greater discount variability, lower gross margins, and may contract at a faster pace during economic downturns. For example, in 2013, our sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter was 4% compared to the previous ten year average of 10%. Most of the weakness during the fourth quarter of 2013 was in larger orders, particularly in the emerging markets. Our historical seasonal variation could be significantly impacted if we cannot maintain or grow our very large order business. Our total operating expenses have in the past tended to increase in each successive quarter and have fluctuated as a percentage of revenue based on the seasonality of our revenue. See Uncertain Global Economic Conditions Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations, above for additional discussion on economic risk factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Reported Financial Results May be Adversely Affected by Changes in Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the U.S. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB\u201d) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. A change in these policies or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that will require a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This new standard will also require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within that period, beginning after December 15, 2016, our fiscal year 2017. We have not yet determined the potential effects of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur Tax Returns and Other Tax Matters are Subject to Examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and Other Tax Authorities and Governmental Bodies and the Results of These Examinations Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition. We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements using prescribed recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns. These uncertain tax positions are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We recognized a tax benefit of $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of the examination of our U.S. income tax returns for 2010 and 2011. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any future examinations. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nTax Law Changes in U.S. Could Have a Negative Impact on our Effective Tax Rate, Earnings and Results of Operations. In 2014, our effective tax rate benefited from the research tax credit in the U.S. This credit expired at the end of 2014 and unless it is extended, we will not be able to take this credit in 2015 or beyond which will have a material negative impact on our effective tax rate in future periods.\nTax Law Changes in Hungary Could Have a Negative Impact on our Effective Tax Rate, Earnings and Results of Operations. The profit from our Hungarian operation benefits from the fact that it is subject to an effective income tax rate that is lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%. Our earnings in Hungary are subject to a statutory tax rate of 19%. The difference between this rate and the statutory U.S. rate of 35% resulted in income tax benefits of $8 million, $8 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, effective January 1, 2010, certain qualified research and development expenses became eligible for an enhanced tax deduction. The enhanced tax deduction for research and development expenses resulted in income tax benefits to us of $12 million, $12 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. This tax benefit may not be available in future years due to changes in political conditions in Hungary or changes in tax laws in Hungary and in the U.S. The reduction or elimination of these benefits in Hungary or future changes in U.S. law pertaining to the taxation of foreign earnings could result in an increase in our future effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur Income Tax Rate could be Affected by the Expiration of a Tax Holiday in Malaysia. Potential future profits from our new manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia are free of tax under a 15 year tax holiday effective January 1, 2013. The tax holiday resulted in an income tax benefit of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. If we fail to satisfy the conditions of the tax holiday, this tax benefit may be terminated early. The expiration of the tax holiday in Malaysia or future changes in U.S. law pertaining to the taxation of foreign earnings could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nA Substantial Majority of our Manufacturing, Warehousing and Distribution Capacity is Located Outside of the United States. We manufacture a substantial majority of our product volume at our facilities in Debrecen, Hungary and Penang, Malaysia. Additional production, primarily of RF products and of low volume, complex or newly introduced products is done in Austin, Texas, however, we will be transitioning all of our Austin, Texas based manufacturing activities to our manufacturing facilities in Hungary and Malaysia over the next six to 12 months. As of December 31 2014, we had successfully transferred approximately 45% of our Austin based production into Hungary and Malaysia. In 2015, our site in Malaysia is expected to produce approximately 30% of our global production. This production is being generated by transferring existing products from our Austin production facility in support of anticipated growth in our business and introducing new products directly into our Malaysian facility. Our site in Hungary is expected to produce approximately 65% of our global production in 2015.\nIn order to enable timely shipment of products to our customers we also maintain the vast majority of our inventory at our international locations. In addition to being subject to the risks of maintaining such a concentration of manufacturing capacity and global inventory, these facilities and their operations are also subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n\u00b7\nthe volatility of the Hungarian forint and the Malaysian ringgit relative to the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7\nchanging and potentially unstable political environment;\n\u00b7\nsignificant and frequent changes in the corporate tax law;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in managing manufacturing operations in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nchallenges in expanding capacity to meet increased demand;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in achieving or maintaining product quality;\n\u00b7\ninterruption to transportation flows for delivery of components to us and finished goods to our customers;\n\u00b7\na restrictive labor code; and,\n\u00b7\nincreasing labor costs.\nNo assurance can be given that our efforts to mitigate these risks will be successful. Any failure to effectively deal with the risks above could result in an interruption in the operations of our facilities in Hungary or Malaysia which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur centralization of inventory and distribution from a limited number of shipping points is subject to inherent risks, including:\n\u00b7\nburdens of complying with additional and/or more complex VAT and customs regulations; and,\n\u00b7\nconcentration of inventory increasing the risks associated with fire, natural disasters and logistics disruptions to customer order fulfillment.\nAny difficulties with the centralization of our distribution or delays in the implementation of the systems or processes to support this centralized distribution could result in an interruption of our normal operations, including our ability to process orders and ship products to our customers. Any failure or delay in distribution from our facilities in Hungary and Malaysia could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur Manufacturing Facility in Penang, Malaysia Could Adversely Affect our Gross Margin, Results of Operations and Earnings if Anticipated Demand is Not Achieved. Our new facility in Malaysia is intended to support our long term manufacturing and warehousing capacity needs. In 2015, our site in Malaysia is expected to produce approximately 30% of our global production. If demand for our products does not grow as expected or if it contracts in future periods, we will have excess warehousing and manufacturing capacity which will cause an increase in overhead that will likely negatively impact our gross margins and results of operations in future periods.\nOur Business is Dependent on Key Suppliers and Distributors and Disruptions in these Businesses Could Adversely Affect our Business and Results of Operations. Our manufacturing processes use large volumes of high-quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources. Several of these components are only available through limited sources. Limited source components purchased include custom ASICs, chassis and other components. We have in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with limited source components, and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future. Accordingly, our failure to receive components from limited suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results. In the event that any of our limited source suppliers experience significant financial or operational difficulties due to adverse global economic conditions or otherwise, our business and operating results would likely be adversely impacted until we are able to secure another source for the required materials.\nIn some countries, we use distributors to support our sales channels. In the event that any of our distributors experience significant financial or operational difficulties due to adverse global economic conditions or if we experience disruptions in the use of these distributors, our business and operating results would likely be adversely impacted until we are able to secure another distributor or establish direct sales capabilities in the affected market.\nWe May Experience Component Shortages that May Adversely Affect Our Business and Result of Operations. As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, supply shortages of components used in our products, including limited source components, can result in significant additional costs and inefficiencies in manufacturing. If we are unsuccessful in resolving any such component shortages in a timely manner, we will experience a significant impact on the timing of revenue, a possible loss of revenue, and/or an increase in manufacturing costs, any of which would have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Uncertain Conditions in the Global Financial Markets May Adversely Affect Our Business and Result of Operations. By virtue of our holdings of cash, investment securities and foreign currency derivatives, we have exposure to many different counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks and investment banks. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default of our counterparties. We continue to monitor the stability of the financial markets, particularly those in the European region and have taken steps to limit our direct and indirect exposure to these markets; however, we can give no assurance that we will not be negatively impacted by any adverse outcomes in those markets. There can be no assurance that any losses or impairments to the carrying value of our financial assets as a result of defaults by our counterparties, would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe Rely on Management Information Systems and Interruptions in our Information Technology Systems Could Adversely Affect our Business. We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. We rely on a primary global center for our management information systems and on multiple systems in branches not covered by our global center. As with any information system, unforeseen issues may arise that could affect our ability to receive adequate, accurate and timely financial information, which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions. Furthermore, it is possible that our global center for information systems or our branch operations could experience a complete or partial shutdown. A significant system or network disruption could be the result of new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts. If such a shutdown or disruption occurred, it would adversely impact our product shipments and revenues, as order processing and product distribution are heavily dependent on our management information systems. Such an interruption could also result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or partner, customer or employee personal data. Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the disruptions or security breaches. Accordingly, our operating results in such periods would be adversely impacted.\nWe are continually working to maintain reliable systems to control costs and improve our ability to deliver our products in our markets worldwide. Our efforts include, but are not limited to the following: firewalls, antivirus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups with offsite retention of storage media, system audits, data partitioning and routine password modifications. No assurance can be given that our efforts will be successful.\nWe are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Website. We devote significant resources to maintain our Website, ni.com, as a key marketing, sales and support tool and expect to continue to do so in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our attempt to leverage the Web to increase sales. Failure to properly maintain our Website may interrupt normal operations, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We host our Website internally. Any failure to successfully maintain our Website or any significant downtime or outages affecting our Website could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nAdoption of Complex Health Care Legislation and Related Regulations and Financial Reform Could Increase our Operating Costs and Adversely Affect Our Result of Operations. The adoption of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and the regulations resulting from such legislation have increased the costs of providing health care to our employees as well as caused us to incur additional administrative burdens and costs to comply with certain provisions of this legislation. We are unable to predict the ultimate amount or timing of any such increased costs or to what extent we may need to divert other resources to comply with various provisions of this legislation. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has resulted in increased costs to us as a result of fees as well as incremental efforts we have had to undertake to comply with provisions of this law which are applicable to our derivative contracts or other financial instruments. In addition to the fees and efforts we have already incurred and undertaken to comply with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we may incur additional costs in future periods as new rules are published and become effective.\nOur Products are Complex and May Contain Bugs or Errors. As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, our new software products or new operating systems of third parties on which our products are based often contain bugs or errors that can result in reduced sales or cause our support costs to increase, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur Business Depends on Our Proprietary Rights and We Have Been Subject to Intellectual Property Litigation. Our success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights relative to the technologies used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may have in the past infringed or violated certain of our intellectual property rights. We from time to time engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights. In monitoring and policing our intellectual property rights, we have been and may be required to spend significant resources. We from time to time may be notified that we are infringing certain patent or intellectual property rights of others. There can be no assurance that any future intellectual property dispute or litigation will not result in significant expense, liability, injunction against the sale of some of our products, and a diversion of management\u2019s attention, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur Business Depends on the Continued Service of Key Management and Technical Personnel. Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management, sales, marketing, research and development and operational personnel, including Dr. Truchard, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and other members of our senior management and key technical personnel. We have no agreements providing for the employment of any of our key employees for any fixed term and our key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We also believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management, technical, marketing, research and development, and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies, as well as training, motivating and supervising employees. The market for hiring and retaining certain technical personnel, including software engineers, has become more competitive and intense in recent periods. Failure to attract a sufficient number of technical personnel, including software engineers or retain our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur Manufacturing Operations are Subject to a Variety of Environmental Regulations and Costs that May Have a Material Adverse Effect on our Business and Results of our Operations. We must comply with many different governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing operations in the U.S., Hungary, and Malaysia. Although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines, suspension of production or a cessation of operations. Any such environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations. Any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.\nOur Acquisitions are Subject to a Number of Related Costs and Challenges that Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations. In recent years, we have completed several acquisitions. Achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition depends upon whether the integration of the acquired business, products or technology is accomplished efficiently and effectively. In addition, successful acquisitions generally require, among other things, integration of product offerings, manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and R&D efforts. These difficulties can become more challenging due to the need to coordinate geographically separated organizations, the complexities of the technologies being integrated, and the necessities of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. The integration of operations following an acquisition also requires the dedication of management resources, which may distract attention from our day-to-day business and may disrupt key R&D, marketing or sales efforts. Our inability to successfully integrate any of our acquisitions could harm our business. The existing products previously sold by entities we have acquired may be of a lesser quality than our products and/or could contain errors that produce incorrect results on which users rely or cause failure or interruption of systems or processes that could subject us to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial position. Furthermore, products acquired in connection with acquisitions may not gain acceptance in our markets, and we may not achieve the anticipated or desired benefits of such transactions.\nWe Are Subject to the Risk of Product Liability Claims. Our products are designed to provide information upon which users may rely. Our products are also used in \u201creal time\u201d applications requiring extremely rapid and continuous processing and constant feedback. Such applications give rise to the risk that a failure or interruption of the system or application could result in economic damage or bodily harm. We attempt to assure the quality and accuracy of the processes contained in our products, and to limit our product liability exposure through contractual limitations on liability, limited warranties, express disclaimers and warnings as well as disclaimers contained in our \u201cshrink wrap\u201d license agreements with end-users. If our products contain errors that produce incorrect results on which users rely or cause failure or interruption of systems or processes, customer acceptance of our products could be adversely affected. Further, we could be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial position. Although we maintain liability insurance for product liability matters, there can be no assurance that such insurance or the contractual limitations used by us to limit our liability will be sufficient to cover or limit any claims which may occur.\nProvisions in Our Charter Documents and Delaware Law May Delay or Prevent an Acquisition of Us. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include a classified Board of Directors, prohibition of stockholder action by written consent, prohibition of stockholders to call special meetings and the requirement that the holders of at least 80% of our shares approve any business combination not otherwise approved by two-thirds of the Board of Directors. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer.\nCompliance With Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is Costly and Challenging. As required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, this Form 10-K contains our management\u2019s certification of adequate disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014. This annual report on Form 10-K also contains a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. This report on Form 10-K also contains an attestation and report by our external auditors with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. While these assessments and reports did not reveal any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, compliance with Sections 302 and 404 is required for each future fiscal year end. We expect that ongoing compliance with Sections 302 and 404 will continue to be costly and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in future periods. Any adverse results from such ongoing compliance efforts could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.", "PERMNO": 81501, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "NATI"}
