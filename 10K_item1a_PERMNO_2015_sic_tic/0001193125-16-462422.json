RISK FACTORS\nThe statements in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section describe material risks to our business and should be considered carefully. You should review carefully the risk factors listed below, as well as those factors listed in other documents we file with the SEC. In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our disclosure and analysis in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our annual report to shareholders contain some forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management\u2019s current plans and assumptions.\nThere are a number of important factors, many of which are beyond our control that could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour business is highly cyclical;\n\u2022\na weakening of the global economy, including capital and credit markets, could adversely affect our business and financial results and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity;\n\u2022\ncyclical fluctuations in the price and supply of our raw materials, particularly fiber, could adversely affect our business;\n\u2022\nwe face intense competition in our markets;\n\u2022\nwe are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nwe are subject to extensive environmental regulation and we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nour business is subject to risks associated with climate change and social and government responses thereto;\n\u2022\nour new ERP system may cost more than expected, be delayed, fail to perform as planned and interrupt operational transactions during and following the implementation, which could adversely affect our operations and results of operations;\n\u2022\nwe periodically use derivatives to manage certain risks which has caused significant fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nour operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to maintain adequate capital resources to provide for such capital requirements;\n\u2022\nfuture acquisitions may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities;\n\u2022\nwe rely on government grants and participate in German statutory energy programs;\n\u2022\nwe are subject to risks related to our employees;\n\u2022\nwe are dependent on key personnel;\n\u2022\nwe may experience material disruptions to our production (including as a result of, among other things, planned and unplanned maintenance downtime);\n\u2022\nif our long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges that could have a material impact on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nwe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks or natural disasters;\n\u2022\nour insurance coverage may not be adequate;\n\u2022\nwe rely on third parties for transportation services;\n\u2022\nfailures or security breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business;\n\u2022\nthe price of our common stock may be volatile;\n\u2022\na small number of our shareholders could significantly influence our business;\n\u2022\nour international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations; and\n\u2022\nwe are exposed to interest rate fluctuations.\nFrom time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\nStatements in the future tense, and all statements accompanied by terms such as \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cproject\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cassume\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cdesign\u201d, \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d and variations thereof and similar terms are intended to be forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities law. You can find examples of these statements throughout this annual report on Form 10-K, including in the description of business in Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d and Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d. While these forward-looking statements reflect our best estimates when made, the following risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections.\nWe intend that all forward-looking statements we make will be subject to safe harbor protection of the federal securities laws pursuant to Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nYou should consider the limitations on, and risks associated with, forward-looking statements and not unduly rely on the accuracy of predictions contained in such forward-looking statements. As noted above, these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date when they are made. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements. Moreover, in the future, we may make forward-looking statements that involve the risk factors and other matters described in this document as well as other risk factors subsequently identified.\nOur business is highly cyclical in nature.\nThe pulp business is highly cyclical in nature and markets are characterized by periods of supply and demand imbalance, which in turn can materially affect prices. Pulp markets are sensitive to cyclical\nchanges in the global economy, industry capacity and foreign exchange rates, all of which can have a significant influence on selling prices and our operating results. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time but generally reflect changes in macro-economic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Pulp is a commodity that is generally available from other producers. Because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition is generally based upon price, which is generally determined by supply relative to demand.\nIndustry capacity can fluctuate as changing industry conditions can influence producers to idle production capacity or permanently close mills. In addition, to avoid substantial cash costs in idling or closing a mill, some producers will choose to operate at a loss, sometimes even a cash loss, which can prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply. Oversupply of our products can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable pricing trends. Certain integrated pulp and paper producers have the ability to discontinue paper production by idling their paper machines and selling their NBSK pulp production on the market, if market conditions, prices and trends warrant such actions.\nCurrently, there have been publicly announced significant increases to expand chemical pulp capacity worldwide. Producers have announced projects to increase hardwood kraft pulp capacity by an aggregate of about 3.6 million ADMTs in 2016 and 2017, primarily in South America and Asia. Further capacity increases of about 2.7 million ADMTs have been announced for 2018. This increase in bleached hardwood kraft pulp is largely targeted at the growing demand for pulp in developing markets, particularly in China, by producers of tissues, specialty papers and packaging. If such additional bleached hardwood kraft pulp supply is not absorbed by such demand growth, as a result of generally lower prices for bleached hardwood kraft pulp, this supply increase could put downward pressure on NBSK pulp prices.\nProducers have also announced increases to NBSK pulp capacity in 2016 and 2017 of an estimated 1.1 million ADMTs, along with another 0.8 million ADMTs of southern softwood and fluff pulp capacity. Further capacity increases of about 0.9 million ADMTs have been announced for 2018. At this time, we cannot predict how much of the publicly announced capacity will come on line and when. If such new capacity, particularly for NBSK pulp, is not absorbed in the market or offset by curtailments or closures of older, high-cost NBSK pulp mills, the increase could put downward pressure on NBSK pulp prices and materially adversely affect our results of operations, margin, and profitability.\nDemand for pulp has historically been determined primarily by general global macroeconomic conditions and has been closely tied to overall business activity. NBSK pulp prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile and can fluctuate widely over time. Between 2005 and 2015, European list prices for NBSK pulp have fluctuated between a low of approximately $575 per ADMT in 2009 to a high of $1,030 per ADMT in 2011.\nA producer\u2019s actual sales price realizations are list prices net of customer discounts, rebates and other selling concessions. Over the last three years, these have increased as producers compete for customers and sales. Our sales price realizations may also be affected by NBSK price movements between the order and shipment dates.\nAccordingly, prices for pulp are driven by many factors outside our control, and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which are often volatile. Because market conditions beyond our control determine the price for pulp, prices may fall below our cash production costs, requiring us to either incur short-term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our mills. Therefore, our profitability depends on managing our cost structure, particularly raw materials which represent a significant component of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our\ncontrol. If the prices of our products decline, or if prices for our raw materials increase, or both, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nA weakening of the global economy, including capital and credit markets, could adversely affect our business and financial results and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.\nAs demand for pulp has principally historically been determined by general global macroeconomic activities, demand and prices for our product have historically decreased substantially during economic slowdowns. A significant economic downturn may affect our sales and profitability. Further, our suppliers and customers may also be adversely affected by an economic downturn. Additionally, restricted credit and capital availability restrains our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our products resulting in lower revenues. Depending on their severity and duration, the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to raise capital, if needed, and otherwise negatively impact our business and financial results.\nOur level of indebtedness could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $638.0 million of indebtedness outstanding. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our high debt levels may have important consequences for us, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes or to fund future operations may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all;\n\u2022\na significant amount of our operating cash flow is dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby diminishing funds that would otherwise be available for our operations and for other purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to current and future adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\na substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or increase in our expenses could make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements, which could force us to modify our operations;\n\u2022\nour leveraged capital structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage by hindering our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions or by making us vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u2022\ncausing us to offer debt or equity securities on terms that may not be favorable to us or our shareholders;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal or interest due in respect of our indebtedness.\nThe indentures that govern our 2019 and 2022 Senior Notes and our bank credit facilities contain restrictive covenants which impose operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These restrictions will affect, and in many respects will limit or prohibit, our ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock, make investments or acquisitions, create liens and enter into mergers,\nconsolidations or transactions with affiliates. The terms of our indebtedness also restrict our ability to sell certain assets, apply the proceeds of such sales and reinvest in our business.\nCertain of the agreements governing our indebtedness have covenants that require us to maintain prescribed financial ratios and tests. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in events of default and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future financial and operating performance. Our performance, in turn, will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, as well as financial, business, legislative, regulatory, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to meet our future debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we can successfully implement our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized. Over the next several years, we will require financing to refinance maturing debt obligations (unless extended), and such refinancing may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nCyclical fluctuations in the price and supply of our raw materials, particularly fiber, could adversely affect our business.\nOur main raw material, which is fiber in the form of wood chips and pulp logs, represents approximately 62% of our cash production costs. Fiber is a commodity and both prices and supply are cyclical. Fiber pricing is subject to regional market influences and our costs of fiber may increase in a region as a result of local market shifts. The cost of wood chips and pulp logs is primarily affected by the supply and demand for lumber. Demand for these raw materials is generally determined by the volume of pulp and paper products produced globally and regionally. Governmental regulations related to the environment, forest stewardship and \u201cgreen\u201d or renewable energy can also affect the supply of fiber. In Germany, governmental initiatives to increase the supply of renewable energy have led to more renewable energy projects in Europe, including Germany. Demand for wood residuals from such energy producers, combined with lower harvesting rates, has generally put upward pressure on prices for wood residuals, such as wood chips, in Germany and its neighboring countries. This has resulted in higher fiber costs for our German mills and such trend could continue to put further upward pressure on wood chip prices. Wood chip supply in Germany was stable during the course of 2014 and 2015 due to stable sawmill production and lower demand from pellet producers and board manufacturers; however, there is no assurance that wood chip supply will continue to be stable or that supply will not be reduced or that fiber costs will not increase in the future.\nSimilarly, North American sawmill activity declined significantly during the recession, reducing the supply of chips and availability of pulp logs to our Celgar mill. Additionally, North American energy producers are exploring the viability of renewable energy initiatives and governmental initiatives in this field are increasing, all of which could lead to higher demand for sawmill residual fiber, including chips. A recovery in U.S. housing starts, which commenced in the latter part of 2012 and has continued through 2015, resulted in increased sawmill activity. This increased the supply of wood chips for the Celgar mill and reduced its need for pulp logs, which are generally a higher cost for the mill than wood chips. Sawmill activity was stable in Canada during 2014 and 2015; however, there is no assurance that sawmill activity will continue to remain stable or that fiber prices will not increase in the future.\nAvailability of fiber may be further limited by adverse responses to and prevention of wildfires, weather, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, wind storms, flooding and other natural causes. In addition, the quantity, quality and price of fiber we receive could be affected by man-made causes such as those resulting from industrial disputes, material curtailments or shut-down of operations by suppliers,\ngovernment orders and legislation (including new taxes or tariffs). Any or a combination of these can affect fiber prices in a region.\nThe cyclical nature of pricing for fiber represents a potential risk to our profit margins if pulp producers are unable to pass along price increases to their customers or we cannot offset such costs through higher prices for our surplus energy.\nWe do not own any timberlands or have any material long-term governmental timber concessions and we currently have few long-term fiber contracts at our German operations. Fiber is available from a number of suppliers and we have not historically experienced material supply interruptions or substantial sustained price increases. However, our requirements have increased and may continue to do so as we expand capacity through capital projects or other efficiency measures at our mills. As a result, we may not be able to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our production requirements at prices acceptable to us during times of tight supply. An insufficient supply of fiber or reduction in the quality of fiber we receive would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIn addition to the supply of fiber, we are, to a lesser extent, dependent on the supply of certain chemicals and other inputs used in our production facilities. Any disruption in the supply of these chemicals or other inputs could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation. Any material increase in the cost of these chemicals or other inputs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe face intense competition in our markets.\nWe sell our pulp globally, with a large percentage sold in Europe, Asia and North America. The markets for pulp are highly competitive. A number of other global companies compete in each of these markets and no company holds a dominant position. Our pulp is considered a commodity because many companies produce similar and largely standardized products. As a result, the primary basis for competition in our markets has been price. Many of our competitors have greater resources and lower leverage than we do and may be able to adapt more quickly to industry or market changes or devote greater resources to the sale of products than we can. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be competitive in the future. Prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which are often volatile. Our ability to maintain satisfactory margin depends, in large part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control.\nThe global pulp market has historically been characterized by considerable swings in prices which have and will result in variability in our earnings.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe have manufacturing operations in Germany and Canada. Most of the operating costs and expenses of our German mills are incurred in euros and those of our Celgar mill in Canadian dollars. However, the majority of our sales are in products quoted in dollars. Our results of operations and financial condition are reported in dollars. As a result, our costs generally benefit from a strengthening dollar but are adversely affected by a decrease in the value of the dollar relative to the euro and to the Canadian dollar. Such shifts in currencies relative to the euro and the Canadian dollar reduce our operating margins and the\ncash flow available to fund our operations and to service our debt. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, while a strengthening dollar generally lowers our costs and expenses, it increases the cost of NBSK pulp to our customers and generally puts downward pressure on pulp prices and reduces our energy and chemical sales revenues as they are sold in euros and Canadian dollars.\nAlthough we report in dollars, we hold certain assets and liabilities, including our mills, in euros and Canadian dollars. We translate foreign denominated assets and liabilities into dollars at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date. Equity accounts are translated using historical exchange rates. Unrealized gains or losses from these translations are recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and do not affect our net earnings, operating income or Operating EBITDA.\nCertain intercompany dollar advances between Mercer Inc. and its foreign subsidiaries are held in euros. When such advances are translated by the subsidiaries into dollars at the end of each reporting period, the gains or losses thereon are reflected in net earnings.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation and we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nOur operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as well as permits, guidelines and policies relating to the protection of the environment. These laws, regulations, permits, guidelines and policies govern, among other things:\n\u2022\nunlawful discharges to land, air, water and sewers;\n\u2022\nwaste collection, storage, transportation and disposal;\n\u2022\nhazardous waste;\n\u2022\ndangerous goods and hazardous materials and the collection, storage, transportation and disposal of such substances;\n\u2022\nthe clean-up of unlawful discharges;\n\u2022\nland use planning;\n\u2022\nmunicipal zoning; and\n\u2022\nemployee health and safety.\nIn addition, as a result of our operations, we may be subject to remediation, clean-up or other administrative orders or amendments to our operating permits, and we may be involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings or inquiries. Future orders, proceedings or inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental laws and land use laws and regulations are constantly changing. New regulations or the increased enforcement of existing laws could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, compliance with regulatory requirements is expensive, at times requiring the replacement, enhancement or modification of equipment, facilities or operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our profitability by offsetting any increased costs of complying with future regulatory requirements.\nWe are subject to liability for environmental damage at the facilities that we own or operate, including damage to neighboring landowners, residents or employees, particularly as a result of the\ncontamination of soil, groundwater or surface water and especially drinking water. The costs of such liabilities can be substantial. Our potential liability may include damages resulting from conditions existing before we purchased or operated these facilities. We may also be subject to liability for any offsite environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances that we or our predecessors arranged to transport, treat or dispose of at other locations. In addition, we may be held legally responsible for liabilities as a successor owner of businesses that we acquire or have acquired. Except for Stendal, our facilities have been operating for decades and we have not done invasive testing to determine whether or to what extent any such environmental contamination exists. As a result, these businesses may have liabilities for conditions that we discover or that become apparent, including liabilities arising from non-compliance with environmental laws by prior owners. Because of the limited availability of insurance coverage for environmental liability, any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures as a result of complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nFurther, enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws and regulations might require significant capital expenditures. We may be unable to generate sufficient funds or access other sources of capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with climate change and social and government responses thereto.\nOur operations and those of our suppliers are subject to climate change variations which can impact the productivity of forests, the abundance of species, harvest levels and lumber. Further, over the last few years, changing weather patterns and climate conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the frequency and unpredictability of natural disasters like earthquakes, storms, wildfires and snow and ice storms. One or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our fiber supply which is our largest cash production cost. There are differing scientific studies and opinions relating to the severity, extent and speed at which climate change is or may be occurring around the world. As a result, we are currently unable to identify and predict all of the specific consequences of climate change on our business and operations.\nFurther, governmental initiatives in response to climate change also have an impact on operations.\nIn Germany, government and social focus on and demand for \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d energy has created greater demand and competition for the wood residuals or fiber that is consumed by our pulp mills as part of their production process. This has helped drive up the cost of fiber for German mills. In addition, further or new governmental initiatives or legislation may also increase both the demand and prices for wood residuals. As governments pursue \u201cgreen\u201d energy initiatives, they may implement financial, tax, pricing or other legislated incentives for renewable energy producers that \u201ccannibalize\u201d or materially adversely affect fiber supplies for existing traditional users, such as lumber and pulp and paper producers.\nSuch additional demand for wood residuals and/or governmental initiatives may materially increase the competition and prices for wood residuals over time. This could increase our fiber costs and/or restrict our ability to acquire fiber at competitive prices or at all during times of shortages. If our fiber costs increase and we cannot pass on these costs to our customers or offset them through higher prices for our sales of surplus energy, it will negatively affect our operating margins, results of operations and financial position. If we cannot obtain the fiber required to operate our mills, we may have to curtail and/or shut down production. This could have a material adverse effect on operations, financial results and financial position.\nOther potential risks to our business from climate change include:\n\u2022\na greater susceptibility of northern softwood forests to disease, fire and insect infestation, which could diminish fiber availability;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of transportation systems and power supply lines due to more severe storms;\n\u2022\nthe loss of fresh water transportation for logs and pulp due to lower water levels;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the quantity and quality of processed water for our mill operations;\n\u2022\nthe loss of northern softwood forests in areas in sufficient proximity to our mills to competitively acquire fiber; and\n\u2022\nlower harvest levels decreasing the supply of harvestable timber and, as a consequence, wood residuals.\nThe occurrence of any or a combination of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or financial results.\nOur new ERP system may cost more than expected, be delayed, fail to perform as planned and interrupt operational transactions during and following the implementation, which could adversely affect our operations and results of operations.\nIn January 2014, we commenced the implementation of a new ERP solution to replace our existing business software applications at a total estimated cost of $12.0 million. The project was designed to be completed in stages over the following two years. Such projects are inherently complex, resource intensive and lengthy. As a result, we could experience unplanned or unforeseen issues that could adversely affect the project, our business and/or our results of operations, including:\n\u2022\ncosts of implementation that materially exceed our expectation;\n\u2022\ndelays in the go-live of one or more of the stages of the project, resulting in additional costs or time for completion;\n\u2022\nerrors in implementation resulting in errors in the commencement or reporting of business transactions;\n\u2022\nfailure in the deliverables of our key partners, suppliers and implementation advisors, resulting in an inferior product, reduced business efficacy and the project not providing expected benefits;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the training of employees in the use of the new solution, resulting in errors in the recording of data or transactions, leading to delays in input deliveries and production impairment;\n\u2022\na control failure during or post implementation, which may result in a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting; and\n\u2022\nother implementation issues leading to delays and impacts on our business.\nWe periodically use derivatives to manage certain risks which has caused significant fluctuations in our operating results.\nIn 2002, Stendal entered into the Stendal Interest Rate Swap Contract to fix interest payments under its indebtedness until 2017, which prevented Stendal from benefiting from the general decline in interest\nrates that ensued. Because we effectively fixed the rate on Stendal\u2019s indebtedness under such contract, the value of our derivative position moves inversely to interest rates. The Stendal Interest Rate Swap Contract remains in place after we refinanced Stendal\u2019s indebtedness in 2014.\nWe also periodically use other derivatives related to currency exchange rates, pulp prices and energy prices.\nWe record unrealized gains or losses on our derivative instruments when they are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and realized gains or losses on them when they are settled. These unrealized and realized gains and losses can materially impact our operating results for any reporting period.\nIf any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize is not effective, we may incur losses which may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The purpose of our derivative activity may also be considered speculative in nature; we do not use these instruments with respect to any pre-set percentage of revenues or other formula, but either to augment our potential gains or reduce our potential losses depending on our perception of future economic events and developments.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to maintain adequate capital resources to provide for such capital requirements.\nOur business is capital intensive and requires that we regularly incur capital expenditures to maintain our equipment, improve efficiencies and, as a result of changes to environmental regulations that require capital expenditures, bring our operations into compliance with such regulations. In addition, we may approve projects in the future that will require significant capital expenditures. Increased capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations. If our available cash resources and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to fund our operating needs and capital expenditures, we would have to obtain additional funds from borrowings or other available sources or reduce or delay our capital expenditures. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health, limit our operations or impair our ability to raise additional capital. If this occurs, we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot maintain or upgrade our equipment as may be required from time to time, we may become unable to manufacture products that compete effectively. An inability to make required capital expenditures in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on our growth, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business.\nIn order to grow our business, we may seek to acquire additional assets or companies. Our ability to pursue selective and accretive acquisitions will be dependent on management\u2019s ability to identify, acquire, and develop suitable acquisition targets in both new and existing markets. In pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities, we face competition from other companies having similar growth strategies, many of which may have substantially greater resources than us. Competition for these acquisitions or investment targets could result in increased acquisition or investment prices, higher risks and a diminished pool of businesses or assets available for acquisition.\nAcquisitions also frequently result in recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the costs of integrating acquired businesses (including restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions, as well as other acquisition costs, such as accounting fees, legal fees and investment banking fees) could significantly impact our operating results.\nAlthough we perform diligence on the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses. We may not be able to ascertain the value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired businesses and their operations until we assume operating control of the assets and operations of these businesses.\nFurthermore, any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nproblems with the effective integration of operations;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs;\n\u2022\nexposure to substantial unanticipated liabilities; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings.\nIn addition, geographic and other expansions, acquisitions or joint ventures may require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from our other operations. If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nCredit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets, increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, including the 2019 and 2022 Senior Notes.\nWe rely on government grants and participate in German statutory energy programs.\nWe currently benefit from a subsidized capital expenditure program as a result of German federal and state government grants. Should either the German federal or state governments be prohibited from honoring legislative grants, or should we be required to repay any such legislative grants, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nSince 2005, our German mills have benefited from sales of emission allowances under the EU ETS. Since our German mills receive stipulated special tariffs under the Renewable Energy Act, the amount of emissions allowances granted to our German mills under the EU ETS has been reduced. Additionally, such emission allowances are subject to statutory amendment or change in the future.\nIn 2014, in response to an investigation by the European Commission into whether portions of the Renewable Energy Act constituted unpermitted state aid, the German government amended the Renewable Energy Act. After such amendment, our German mills continued to sell \u201cgreen\u201d energy into the market at stipulated prices or \u201ctariffs\u201d. Furthermore, they were exempted, as \u201cexisting installations\u201d, from certain surcharges on the consumption of energy that they generate, or \u201cauto-generation\u201d. This exemption is set to be re-considered in 2017. The German government has publicly announced that it intends to further amend\nthe Renewable Energy Act in 2016 so that funding for renewable energy is to be allocated through an auction system starting in 2017. The auction system is expected to be primarily designed to create a competitive bidding process for new installations of wind and solar energy. While the current funding system is expected to continue to apply to biomass energy, the current governmental paper proposes to develop tender mechanisms for biomass installations, for which funding under the current system has run out. At this time, the final proposed amendments to the Renewable Energy Act, and in particular those that affect biomass producers like our German mills, have not been released. As a result, we cannot predict the effect of any promulgated amendments to the Renewable Energy Act on our German mills\u2019 sale or consumption of energy.\nOur costs of energy for our operations in Germany could increase in the event that the auto-generation surcharge exemption is removed or reduced in the future. Additionally, if the stipulated tariffs for energy sold by our German mills are reduced in the future as a result of legislative changes, our energy sales in Germany may not be as profitable. Any of the foregoing situations or any combination of them could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to our employees.\nThe majority of our employees are unionized and we have collective agreements in place with our employees at all of our mills. Although we have not experienced any material work stoppages in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable collective agreements or other satisfactory arrangements with our employees upon the expiration of our collective agreements. This could result in a strike or work stoppage by the affected workers. The registration or renewal of the collective agreements or the outcome of our wage negotiations could result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members. Additionally, changing demographics may make it more difficult for us to recruit skilled employees in the future. Accordingly, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher on-going labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, whenever we seek to reduce workforce at any of our mills, the affected mill\u2019s labor force could seek to hinder or delay such actions, we could incur material severance or other costs, and our operations could be disrupted.\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nOur future success depends, to a large extent, on the efforts and abilities of our executive and senior mill operating officers. Such officers are industry professionals many of whom have operated through multiple business cycles. Our officers play an integral role in, among other things:\n\u2022\nsales and marketing;\n\u2022\nreducing operating costs;\n\u2022\nidentifying capital projects which provide a high rate of return; and\n\u2022\nprioritizing expenditures and maintaining employee relations.\nThe loss of one or more of our officers could make us less competitive in these areas which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We do not maintain any key person life insurance for any of our executive or senior mill operating officers.\nWe may experience material disruptions to our production.\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our pulp and energy sales and/or negatively impact our results of operations. Any of our mills could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\n\u2022\nunscheduled maintenance outages;\n\u2022\nprolonged power failures;\n\u2022\nequipment failure;\n\u2022\nemployee errors or failures;\n\u2022\ndesign error or employee or contractor error;\n\u2022\nchemical spill or release;\n\u2022\nexplosion of a boiler;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railway tracks, tunnels, canals and ports;\n\u2022\nfires, floods, earthquakes or other natural catastrophes;\n\u2022\nprolonged supply disruption of major inputs;\n\u2022\nlabor difficulties;\n\u2022\ncapital projects that require temporary cost increases or curtailment of production; and\n\u2022\nother operational problems.\nAny such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If any of our facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production capacity targets and satisfy customer requirements would be impaired and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges that could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Should the markets for our products deteriorate or should we decide to invest capital differently or should other cash flow assumptions change, it is possible that we will be required to record non-cash impairment charges in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, terrorist attacks or natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks or natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to manage or operate our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate.\nWe have obtained insurance coverage that we believe would ordinarily be maintained by an operator of facilities similar to our mills. Our insurance is subject to various limits and exclusions. Damage or destruction to our facilities could result in claims that are excluded by, or exceed the limits of, our insurance coverage. Additionally, the weak global and financial markets have also reduced the availability and extent of credit insurance for our customers. If we cannot obtain adequate credit insurance for our customers, we may be forced to amend or curtail our planned operations which could negatively impact our sales revenues, results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely on third parties for transportation services.\nOur business primarily relies upon third parties for the transportation of pulp to our customers, as well as for the delivery of our raw materials to our mills. Our pulp and raw materials are principally transported by truck, barge, rail and sea-going vessels, all of which are highly regulated. Increases in transportation rates can also materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nFurther, if our transportation providers fail to deliver our pulp in a timely manner, it could negatively impact our customer relationships and we may be unable to sell it at full value. If our transportation providers fail to deliver our raw materials in a timely fashion, we may be unable to manufacture pulp in response to customer orders. Also, if any of our transportation providers were to cease operations, we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailures or security breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.\nWe use information technologies to securely manage our operations and various business functions. We rely on various technologies to process, store and report on our business and to communicate electronically between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers. We also use information technologies to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. Despite our security design and controls, and those of our third party providers, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues or may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such interruption or breach could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data that could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, litigation or have a negative impact on our reputation. There can be no assurance that such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions will not negatively impact our cash flows and materially affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above and the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors\u2019 operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nour growth rate and our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\nthe financial market and general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations.\nIn addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and would divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nA small number of our shareholders could significantly influence our business.\nThere are a few significant shareholders of our common stock who own a substantial percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock. These few significant shareholders, either individually or acting together, may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of the company or our assets. This concentration of ownership may make it more difficult for other shareholders to effect substantial changes in the company, may have the effect of delaying, preventing or expediting, as the case may be, a change in control of the company, and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the possibility that one or more of these significant shareholders may sell all or a large portion of their common stock in a short period of time could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Also, the interests of these few shareholders may not be in the best interests of all shareholders.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nAs a result of our international sales and operations, we are subject to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the United States, Canada and other governments or organizations, including prohibitions in the U.S. against foreign competitors\u2019 (including our operating subsidiaries) receipt of certain unlawful foreign governmental benefits. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Changes in trade sanctions laws could restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions including fines, loss of authorizations needed to conduct our international business, the imposition of tariffs or duties, and other penalties, which could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to interest rate fluctuations.\nInterest on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at \u201cfloating\u201d rates. As a result, increases in interest rates will increase our costs of borrowing and reduce our operating margins.", "PERMNO": 75578, "SIC": 2611, "TIC": "MERC"}
