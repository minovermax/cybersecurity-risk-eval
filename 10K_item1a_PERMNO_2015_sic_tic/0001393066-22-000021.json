{"cik": "1393066", "company": "Resolute Forest Products Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC, you should carefully consider the following factors, among others, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, future results, reputation as well as the market price of our securities. In particular, the risks described below could cause actual events to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.\nRisks related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nWe are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties related to pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, its resulting variants, illnesses, and related impacts, the nature, intensity and duration of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. These risks are expected to continue to negatively affect our business, results of operations and market price of our securities, in a number of ways, including the following as described below.\nWhile we have been able and expect to continue to operate in all of our business segments in Canada and the U.S., we had to reduce our operational footprint to levels consistent with sanitary constraints or reduced needs, including the temporary or indefinite idling of certain machines or facilities and implementing temporary or permanent layoffs. Further adjustments to our operational footprint, temporary or permanent, could be made as the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic conditions develop.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the secular demand decline for paper products we manufacture as widespread confinement and increasing remote work conditions alter consumer habits, which has had, and could continue to have an impact on pulp demand and availability of recycled fiber. The decline in demand and altered habits could have a permanent effect.\nWhile pandemic conditions have had some favorable impact on volumes and prices of wood products during certain periods, it is difficult to predict volumes and prices in the future and consequently their impact on our results. Any construction or repair and modeling slowdown in North America may result in a decline in demand for wood products.\nThere is lower demand for our away-from-home tissue products usually found in hotels, restaurants, schools, office buildings and other businesses or premises, and our ability to convert our tissue for the retail market may be limited. We are unable to predict when the away-from-home market may recover.\nThere is increased risk that we may not obtain raw materials, chemicals and other required supplies or services in a timely fashion, at all, or at favorable prices due to inflation, the impact of reduced economic activity and worker shortages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic on our suppliers and service providers, which could affect our production output and profitability. The worker shortages in transportation and logistics services are impacting our ability to ship our products to our customers on a timely and cost efficient basis.\nAdditional trade restrictions or barriers could also negatively affect our supply chain as well as the sales or distribution of our products. For example, proposed or mandatory vaccination of truck drivers at the border between Canada and the U.S. could increase the shortage of available drivers already affecting transportation and logistics services.\nThe current health restrictions, including social distancing measures, impact how our employees fulfill their duties, and limits the number of employees we can have at our operations, which in turn could impact our production output and costs. Mandatory vaccination in jurisdictions where we operate could further impact workforce shortages if employees or prospective employees refuse vaccination and become unable to work. Mandatory testing may also increase our operational costs. We could face personnel shortages if employees become ill, are quarantined or no longer available or amenable to return to work.\nAny reduced operations and staffing at our facilities, remote working conditions and increased risk of obtaining supplies or services could increase the risk of non-compliance and incidents.\nStrategies to increase earnings power or generate additional cash flow, including capital projects, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions could be delayed or not materialize given the current economic uncertainty and the difficulties relating to workforce shortages and their impact on completion of our projects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental responses and economic impacts, market disruptions and changes in consumer habits, has heightened the risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors below, and should be read in conjunction therewith. The outbreak of future pandemics is difficult to predict and could have similar or greater impacts.\nStrategic Risks\nStrategic risks relate to our future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with the global macro-environment in which we operate, trends in our industry, demand for our products, competitive threats, product innovation, public policy developments, changes to consumption habits, resource allocation, and strategic initiatives, including mergers and acquisitions, dispositions, and restructuring activity.\nDevelopments in non-print media and changes in consumer habits regarding the use of paper are expected to continue to adversely affect the demand for some of our products.\nTrends in non-print media are expected to continue to adversely affect demand for traditional print media, including our papers, and our customers\u2019 products. Neither the timing nor the extent of these trends can be predicted with certainty. Our newspaper, magazine, book and catalog publishing customers could increase their use of, and compete with, non-print media, including multimedia technologies, electronic storage and communication platforms such as websites and social media, which could further reduce their consumption of newsprint, commercial printing papers or other products we manufacture, including market pulp. The demand for our paper products has weakened significantly over the past decade and this trend has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic as confinement and work from home has altered consumer habits, which could become permanent and also impact the demand for pulp. For example, over the 10 years ended December 31, 2021, according to industry statistics, North American newsprint demand fell by 68%, and fell by 7% in 2021.\nWe face intense competition in the forest products industry.\nWe compete with numerous forest products companies, some of which have greater financial resources. The trend toward consolidation in the forest products industry has led to the formation of sizable global producers that have greater flexibility in pricing and financial resources for marketing, investment, research and development, innovation, and expansion. Because the markets for our products are highly competitive, actions by competitors can affect our ability to compete and the volatility of prices at which our products are sold. For example, favorable market price conditions of wood, pulp or paper products could attract investments from competitors, including the reopening of plants in markets where we compete, which in turn could have an impact on our sales, profitability and cash flows.\nThe forest products industry is capital intensive, and we require significant investment to remain competitive. Some of our competitors may be lower-cost producers in some of the businesses in which we operate. For example, the sizable low-cost hardwood and softwood grade pulp capacity in South America, which continues to grow as a result of ongoing investment and whose costs are thought to be very competitive, and the actions those mills take to gain market share, could continue to adversely affect our competitive position in similar grades. This in turn could impact our sales and cash flows, and push us to consider significant capital investments to remain competitive. Failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to offer products certified to globally recognized forestry management and chain of custody standards or meet customers\u2019 product specifications, it could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nBased on market interest, we offer a number of our products, including pulp and paper, wood and tissue, with specific designations to one or more globally recognized forest management and chain of custody standards as well as product specifications to meet customers\u2019 requirements. Our ability to conform to new or existing guidelines for certification depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as: changes to the standards or the interpretation or the application of the standards; the collaboration of our suppliers in timely sharing product information; the adequacy of government-implemented conservation measures; and the existence of territorial disputes between Indigenous peoples and governments. If we are unable to offer certified products, for which demand is growing, or to meet commitments to supply certified products or meet the product specifications of our customers, it could adversely affect the marketability of our products and our ability to compete with other producers.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our strategies to increase earnings power.\nOur corporate strategy is focused on value creation by growing in wood and pulp products, investing in product innovation, and maximizing cash generation from our paper assets, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. The implementation of our corporate strategy is subject to uncertainty and could require significant capital investments. In addition, strategic initiatives could have unintended consequences, including, for example, a loss of certain pulp customers if our tissue segment becomes competitive with tissue products sold by those customers.\nAs part of our corporate strategy, we pursue acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions and projects to complement, expand or optimize our business. In connection with any acquisition, divestiture, strategic transaction or project, we may not successfully integrate an acquired business, assets, technologies, processes, controls, policies, and operations with ours or realize some or all of the anticipated benefits and synergies of the acquisition, divestiture, strategic transaction or project. In connection with such transactions, we may face challenges associated with entering into a new market, production location, product category or meeting customers\u2019 demands. We may also face issues with the separation of processes and loss of synergies following the divestiture of businesses, or idling or closure of facilities. In addition, we may not be able to successfully negotiate potential acquisitions, divestitures, strategic transactions or projects that we identify, or may not be able to obtain financing that may be needed. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, and substantial goodwill. The negotiation of any transaction and its completion may be complex, costly, and time consuming. To the extent we are unsuccessful in implementing our corporate strategy or our efforts do not achieve the anticipated outcomes, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nChanges in the political or economic conditions in the U.S., Canada or other countries in which we sell our products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe manufacture products in the U.S. and Canada, and we sell products throughout the world. The economic and political policies of the countries and regions in which we do business have a significant impact on our costs and the prices of, and demand for, our products. Changes in regional economies and economic policies can affect demand for our products, manufacturing and distribution costs, pricing, sales volume and the availability or cost of insurance. These changes, in turn, can affect our results of operations. Changes to regional economies and economic policies that can bring about such effects include, among others, changes in the terms of, or countries that are parties to, bilateral and multi-lateral trade agreements and arrangements, limitations on the ability of potential customers to import products or obtain foreign currency for payment of imported products, and political and economic instability, including pandemics, significant civil unrest, acts of war or terrorist activities, or unstable or unpredictable governments in countries in which we operate or trade.\nOur business is subject to global economic conditions and is highly cyclical; soft conditions could cause a number of the risks we face to increase in likelihood, magnitude and duration.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. During periods of weak or weakening global economic conditions, we would expect any increase in unemployment or lower gross domestic product growth rates to adversely affect demand for our products as our customers delay or reduce their expenditures. For example, during an economic downturn, end consumers may reduce printed newspaper and magazine subscriptions as a direct result of their financial circumstances, contributing to lower demand for print advertisements and for our products by our customers. In addition, demand for our market pulp products is generally associated with the production rates of paper producers, as well as consumption trends for products such as tissue, toweling and absorbent products.\nAn economic downturn in the U.S. or Canada could also negatively affect the U.S. or Canadian housing industry, which is a significant driver of demand for our lumber and other wood-based products. For example, a decline in housing starts or in the repair and remodeling segment could create a low level of primary demand for our lumber and other wood-based products, which we would expect to result in our wood products business operating at a lower level until there is a meaningful recovery in new residential construction demand or in the repair and remodeling sector. In addition, with less lumber demand, sawmills could generate fewer wood chips that we use in our pulp and paper mills, which could lead those mills to increase their supply from the open market, where prices can fluctuate with market conditions. This could also lead to reduced availability of wood residue for internal use, which would increase our fossil fuel consumption and, as a result, our costs and environmental impact, and affect our sustainability efforts.\nThe forest products industry is also highly cyclical and it is difficult to predict the intensity and duration of the economic cycles that affect our business and the specific impact on our different products. The overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture, and consequently, our sales and profitability, reflect fluctuations in levels of end user demand. In addition to end user demand, we have experienced cyclical changes in prices, sales volume and margins for our commodity products as a result of changing market trends and the effect of capacity fluctuations on supply and demand as well as the relative competitiveness of producers. Because our commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition is based mainly on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand, which is in turn affected by the factors described above.\nOperational Risks\nOperational risks arise from external events, processes, people and systems that affect the operation of our businesses. These include risks affecting, among other things, marketing and sales, woodlands management, production, supply chains, information management, data protection and security, including cybersecurity, human resources and reputation.\nOur manufacturing businesses may have difficulty obtaining timber, wood fiber and market pulp at favorable prices, or at all.\nWood fiber is the principal raw material we use in our business. We primarily use wood chips and logs for our pulp and paper mills. Our wood products business is also dependent on our timber supply.\nWe depend heavily on harvesting rights and timber supply guarantees over government-owned land in Ontario and Quebec, respectively. The volume of harvest permitted under these licenses is subject to limits, which are generally referred to as the AAC. The AAC is reviewed regularly, typically every five years in Quebec and every 10 years in Ontario. The next AAC revision in Quebec is scheduled to take place in 2023 while Ontario has completed AAC revisions in 2021 for the forests in which we operate. About 25% of the total allowable harvesting rights in Quebec are allocated through an open auction system. The prices generated by the auction system are used to set pricing for the remainder of the AAC. The timber requirements for our U.S. sawmills are met mostly by purchasing timber from timberland owners and third-party harvesters.\nIn addition, regulatory developments, activist campaigns and litigation advanced by Indigenous groups or other stakeholders have caused, and may cause in the future, significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest in Canada, or that meet standards required for third-party certifications. Future regulation, particularly by Ontario, Quebec, or the federal Canadian government, as well as litigation, changes in forest management certification standards, and actions taken by activists to influence the availability of timber for commercial harvest could focus on any one or more of the use of timberlands, forest management practices, forest management and chain of custody certification standards, consultation with Indigenous groups, protection of habitats and endangered or other species, including the woodland caribou, promotion of forest biodiversity, and the response to, and prevention of, catastrophic wildfires. Increased pressures on the Canadian provincial and federal governments to increase the protection of the woodland caribou, its habitat, and the boreal forest, could impact timber supply.\nOur access to timber may also be affected by factors such as fire and fire prevention, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, wind storms, drought, flooding, climate change effects and other natural and man-made causes, which could potentially reduce supply and increase prices.\nThough timber is our primary source of fiber, wood fiber is a commodity and we also buy a significant portion of our fiber requirements on the open market. Prices for wood fiber are cyclical and subject to market influences, which could be concentrated in one or more regions due to market shifts.\nFollowing the indefinite idling of our pulp and paper operations at Calhoun, we may have greater difficulty sourcing the pulp required for our operating tissue facilities at comparable costs, which could impact the profitability of our tissue operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of timber, wood fiber or market pulp at favorable prices for any of the reasons described above, our business operation could be materially and adversely affected.\nInflation or a sustained increase in the cost of purchased energy, other raw materials and services would lead to higher manufacturing costs, which could reduce our margins.\nOur operations consume large amounts of energy, such as electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and wood residue, a substantial proportion of which we buy on the open market. The main raw materials we require in our manufacturing processes are wood fiber and chemicals. The prices for raw materials and energy are volatile, affected by inflation, and may change rapidly, which impacts our manufacturing costs, directly affects our results of operations and may contribute to earnings volatility. We also rely on service providers and contractors in our operations, the costs of which have also increased due to workforce shortages and inflation.\nFor our commodity products, the relationship between industry supply and demand, rather than changes in the cost of raw materials, determines our ability to increase prices. Consequently, we may be unable to pass along increases in our operating costs to our customers. Any sustained increase in energy, chemical, or raw material prices without any corresponding increase in product pricing would reduce our operating margins and potentially require us to limit or cease operations of one or more of our facilities.\nWe also generate electricity at our hydroelectric and co-generation facilities. There can be no certainty that we will be able to maintain the water rights necessary for our hydroelectric power generating facilities, or to renew such rights or power sales contracts on favorable conditions. The closure of certain machines or facilities located in Quebec could trigger the exercise of termination rights by the Quebec government under water rights agreements. The amount of electricity we can generate at our hydroelectric facilities is also subject to the volume of rain or snowfall and is therefore variable from one year to the next.\nWe are subject to the potential loss of important customers and accounts receivable credit risk exposure.\nLosing important customers or increased accounts receivable credit risk exposure due to financial difficulties of our customers, could adversely affect our sales, financial condition, future results, as well as the market price of our securities.\nWe are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, transition and litigation risks associated with global, regional, and local weather conditions, and climate change.\nOur operations and the operations of our suppliers are subject to climate variations, which impact the productivity of forests, the frequency and severity of wildfires, the availability of water, the distribution and abundance of species, and the spread of disease or insect epidemics, which in turn may adversely or positively affect timber production and availability. Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, drought, flooding, snow, ice storms, the spread of disease, and insect infestations. Any of these natural disasters or other conditions could also affect woodlands or cause variations in the cost of raw materials, such as virgin fiber. Changes in precipitation could make wildfires more frequent or more severe, and could adversely affect timber harvesting or our hydroelectric generation. The effects of global, regional and local weather conditions, and climate change, including the costs of complying with evolving climate change regulations and any related litigation could also adversely impact our results of operations.\nImplementation of climate-change mitigation programs could increase our costs in the short term, including as a result of potential GHG emissions reporting obligations in the U.S. and more detailed mandatory reporting in both Ontario and Quebec all of which may require additional resources for monitoring, tracking, calibrating and reporting information, as well as training and verification. Carbon price mechanisms, such as the cap and trade system in Quebec, have an impact on the operational costs of covered facilities, as well as the cost of fuel from distributors operating under the programs. The price of carbon in Canada could continue to increase, and a price on carbon could be introduced in the U.S. International reporting protocols could change their standards for reporting GHG emissions, including changing the distinction that is currently made between CO2 emissions from biomass combustion at stationary sources and CO2 generated from fossil fuels. Regulatory bodies could also change their position on the carbon-neutrality of biomass energy, which would significantly alter our carbon footprint. Adopting and incorporating new technologies to help with the transition toward a low-carbon economy are also transitional risks that could represent significant costs to the Company or may expose us to unforeseen risks.\nThere is increased focus on sustainability reporting and the importance of ESG scores from investors, customers and other stakeholders, which may impact our business.\nSustainability/ESG reporting frameworks are numerous and evolving rapidly. Sustainability governance, performance and disclosures are reviewed and monitored by investors, customers, stakeholders and ESG scoring service providers using different methodologies, which may impact how investors, creditors and stakeholders perceive, justifiably or not, our company as an investment, debtor, supplier or business partner. In the event we were unable to achieve our stated sustainability targets, goals and commitments or if our sustainability statements were challenged as erroneous, inaccurate or incomplete, whether justified or not, we could sustain damage to our reputation and expose ourselves to litigation and liability. Evolving standards and regulations related to climate change, sustainability and ESG reporting may also result in additional compliance costs, impose strain on our human capital resources, and expose us to a new type of credit risk.\nWe could experience disruptions in operations or increased labor costs due to labor disputes or occupational health and safety issues.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 6,900 people, of whom approximately 4,000 were represented by various unions, primarily Unifor, and the CNTU in Canada, and predominantly by the USW in the U.S. In the past year, we renewed or entered into a number of agreements with unions, covering approximately 500 employees in Canada. Additional collective agreements covering approximately 2,000 employees in Canada are scheduled to expire in 2022, involving pulp and paper mills and sawmills.\nWhile we intend to renew collective agreements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew agreements on satisfactory terms, or that we will maintain continuously satisfactory agreements with all of our unionized employees. Should\nwe be unable to do so, it could result in strikes, work stoppages, or disturbances by affected employees, which could cause us to experience a disruption of operations and affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOccupational health and safety issues could also cause disruptions in operations or otherwise affect labor-related costs. More specifically, our operations have been and could continue to be negatively affected by workforce availability and logistics constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions.\nDifficulties in our employee relations or difficulties identifying, attracting, and retaining employees for work, particularly in remote locations and certain positions with specialized skills, could lead to operational disruptions or increase our costs.\nOur ability to achieve our future goals and objectives is dependent, in part, on maintaining good relations with our employees and minimizing employee turnover at our corporate offices, mills, and woodlands operations. Work stoppages, excessive employee turnover, or difficulty in attracting and retaining employees, particularly for work in remote locations and certain positions with specialized skill sets, could lead to operational disruptions or increased costs. As experienced workers retire, we could encounter loss of knowledge and specialized skills sets, which could lead to operational disruptions or increased costs.\nDisruptions to our supply chain, operations, or the delivery of our products, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe success of our businesses is largely contingent on the availability of, and direct access to, raw materials, as well as our ability to ship products on a timely and cost-efficient basis. As a result, any event that disrupts or limits transportation or delivery services or the operations of our suppliers, including workforce shortages and economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and adversely affect our business, including increasing our inventory levels. In addition, our operating results depend on the continued operation of our various production facilities and our ability to complete construction and maintenance projects on schedule. Interruptions of operations at our facilities, including interruptions caused by the events described below, could materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or our business as a whole, during and after the period of such operational difficulties.\nOur operations, supply chain, and transportation and delivery services are subject to potential hazards, including explosions, fires, accidental release of toxic materials, severe weather and natural disasters, climate change effects, mechanical and power failures, structural failures at any of our dams or hydroelectric facilities, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other difficulties, public health measures to prevent, manage or eradicate epidemics or pandemics, transportation interruptions, remediation complications, environmental and workplace risks, and terrorist or other violent acts.\nSome of these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, equipment, or the environment, and can result in, among other things: the suspension of operations; the shutdown of affected facilities; reputational damage; the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; workers\u2019 compensation; and other claims against us with respect to workplace exposure, exposure of contractors and others located on or off our premises.\nWe are subject to disruptions impacting the information technology systems used to manage our operations and other business processes, including cybersecurity and privacy incidents that could involve sensitive company, employee, customer, vendor, and shareholder information.\nWe use information technology to securely manage operations and various business functions. We rely on technologies, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, store, and report on our business and interact with employees, customers, vendors, and shareholders. The secure and reliable processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security design and controls, and those of our third-party providers, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to interruptions, breakdowns, cyberattacks or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance, hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, as well as other disruptions. Cybersecurity and privacy related incidents and vulnerabilities may remain undetected for an extended period of time. A cybersecurity breach in our systems, in those of our service providers or anyone in our supply chain could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data or personal information and could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, litigation, or have a negative impact on our reputation. We may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or cyberattacks, or to remediate problems caused by such breaches, attacks, or other disruptions. We have been, as well as some of our service providers, the subject of cyberattacks from time to time, none of which, to our knowledge, have had a material impact on our business information systems or operations. There can be no assurance that such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions will not negatively impact our cash flows and materially affect our results of operations or financial condition. Recent developments in cybersecurity and privacy legislation in different jurisdictions are imposing additional obligations on us and could expand our potential liability in the event of a cybersecurity or privacy incident.\nWe are currently transitioning from certain legacy system applications, and during the transition, such legacy systems may be more vulnerable to attack or failure and implementation of the transition may cause disruptions to our business information systems.\nWe are currently in the process of replacing certain legacy system applications with an integrated business management software platform. Prior to the completion of this upgrading process, we may not have supplier or third-party support for legacy systems in the event of failure or required updates, and such legacy systems may be more vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. We may also experience difficulties maintaining or replacing the hardware infrastructure required to operate these legacy systems. Such legacy systems, if not properly functioning prior to their replacement, could adversely affect our business.\nDuring the process of replacing legacy systems, we could experience disruptions to our business information systems and normal operating processes because of the projects\u2019 complexity. The potential adverse consequences could include delays, loss of information, decreased management reporting capabilities, damage to our ability to process transactions, harm to our control environment, diminished employee productivity, business interruptions, and unanticipated increases in costs. Further, our ability to achieve anticipated operational benefits from new platforms is not assured.\nNegative publicity, even if unjustified, could have a negative impact on our brand and the marketability of our products.\nWhile we believe that we have established a reputation for transparent communications, social and corporate governance, responsible forestry practices, and overall sustainability leadership, negative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to our operations and our business or to our industry, could tarnish our reputation or reduce the value of our brand and market demand for our products. In addition, the actions of activists, including legislative initiatives or other campaigns affecting boreal-sourced forest products, whether justified or not, could impede or delay our ability to access raw materials or obtain third-party certifications with respect to forest management and chain of custody standards that we seek in order to supply certified products to our customers. Activist campaigns could affect our revenues and require us to incur significant expenses and dedicate substantial resources to defend ourselves, rebuild our reputation, and restore the value of our brand.\nFinancial Risks\nFinancial risks relate to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks, including: volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation, commodity prices, capital structure, as well as credit and liquidity risk, including risk related to cash management, extension of credit, collections, credit ratings, and availability and cost of funding.\nCurrency fluctuations can adversely affect our competitive position, selling prices, manufacturing costs, and net monetary items.\nWe compete with producers from around the world, particularly North America, Europe, and South America, in most of our product lines, with the exception of wood products and tissue, where we compete primarily with other North American producers. We sell our products mainly in transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, but we also sell in certain local currencies, including the Canadian dollar, the euro, and the pound sterling. Changes in the relative strength or weakness of these currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, could affect international trade flows of these products. A stronger U.S. dollar might attract imports, thereby increasing product supply and possibly creating downward pressure on prices. On the other hand, a weaker U.S. dollar might encourage U.S. exports but also increase manufacturing costs in Canadian dollars.\nWe are particularly sensitive to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. The actual impact of these changes depends primarily on the proportion of our production and sales that occur in Canada, the proportion of our financial assets and liabilities denominated in Canadian dollars, and the magnitude, direction and duration of changes in the exchange rate. We expect exchange rate fluctuations to continue to impact costs and revenues, but we cannot predict the magnitude or direction of this effect for any period, and there can be no assurance of any future effects. In 2020 and 2021, the Canadian dollar fluctuated between a low of US$0.69 in March of 2020 and a high of US$0.83 in June of 2021. Based on operating projections for 2022, if the Canadian dollar strengthens by one cent against the U.S. dollar, we expect that it will decrease our annual operating income by approximately $21 million, and vice versa.\nFurthermore, certain monetary assets and liabilities, including a substantial portion of our net pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our net deferred income tax assets, and certain of our indebtedness, including the secured delayed draw term loan facility (or, the \u201cLoan Facility\u201d), are denominated in Canadian dollars. As a result, our earnings, financial condition and the amounts borrowable under our Loan Facility can be subject to the potentially significant effect of foreign exchange gains or losses in respect of these Canadian dollar net monetary items. A fluctuation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S.\ndollar in any given period would generally cause a foreign exchange gain or loss or change in the effective availability of the Loan Facility.\nThe amount by which our pension plans are underfunded could increase the level of required contributions, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net pension obligations of $1,041 million, of which approximately 75% relates to our registered pension plans in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and approximately 25% of which relates to our U.S. qualified pension plan. See Note 16, \u201cPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans,\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for a description of our pension plan funding obligations, including our unfunded pension obligations.\nThe amount by which our pension plans are funded or underfunded varies depending upon the return on pension fund investments, the level of interest rates used to determine minimum funding levels, the payments of benefits, and other actuarial assumptions and experience. Variations from our assumptions would cause the actual amount of our required contributions to vary from our current estimates. Any additional contributions to our pension plans to fund potential deficit increases would be required to be paid over a period of time ranging from ten to 15 years depending upon the laws applicable to the funding of the specific pension plan. Any change to laws and regulations applicable to the funding of our pension plans could also increase or decrease our future funding obligations. Similarly, because we make our Quebec and Ontario pension plan contributions in Canadian dollars, the amount of our contributions as stated in U.S. dollars can be subject to the potentially significant effect of foreign currency exchange rate variations. Any such variations could materially affect our cash flows and financial condition, in each case either positively or negatively depending on the direction and magnitude of the variation. In addition, an increase in our net pension obligations could make it more difficult to obtain financing on favorable terms.\nIt is also possible that regulators, including Canadian provincial pension regulators, could attempt to compel additional funding of certain of our pension plans, including our Canadian registered pension plans, in respect of plan members associated with sites we formerly operated. On June 12, 2012, we filed a motion for directives with the Quebec Superior Court, the court with jurisdiction in the creditor protection proceedings under the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) (or, the \u201cCCAA Creditor Protection Proceedings\u201d), seeking an order to prevent pension regulators in each of Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador from declaring partial wind-ups of pension plans relating to employees of former operations in New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador, or a declaration that any claim for accelerated reimbursements of deficits arising from a partial wind-up is a barred claim under the CCAA Creditor Protection Proceedings. A partial wind-up would likely shorten the period in which any deficit within those plans, which could reach up to C$150 million ($119 million), would have to be funded if we do not obtain the relief sought. At this time, we cannot estimate the additional contributions, if any, that may be required in future years, but they could be material.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to maintain adequate capital resources to provide for all of our capital requirements.\nOur businesses are capital intensive and require regular capital expenditures in order to maintain our equipment, increase our operating efficiency, comply with environmental laws, and innovate to remain competitive. If our available cash resources and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to fund our operating needs, make pension contributions, and finance our working capital, capital expenditures, and duty cash deposits, we would either need to borrow or reduce or delay capital expenditures. If we cannot maintain or upgrade our equipment as required, we may become unable to manufacture products that compete effectively. An inability to make required capital expenditures in a timely fashion could also have a material adverse effect on our growth, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe terms of our ABL Credit Facility, our Senior Secured Credit Facility, the indenture governing our 2026 Notes and our Loan Facility could restrict our current and future operations, and increases to interest rates as well as changes relating to LIBOR could impact our borrowings under some of these facilities.\nThe credit agreements governing our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (or, the \u201cABL Credit Facility\u201d), our senior secured credit facility (or, the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facility\u201d), the indenture governing our 4.875% senior notes due 2026 (or, the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d), and our Loan Facility contain certain restrictive covenants that impose operating, borrowing, investing and financial restrictions on us and could limit our ability to engage in activities that might be in our long-term best interests. For a description of our ABL Credit Facility, Senior Secured Credit Facility, the indenture governing the 2026 Notes and the Loan Facility, including the covenants and restrictions they contain, see Note 15, \u201cLong-Term Debt,\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA breach of the covenants under the ABL Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the 2026 Notes or the Loan Facility could result in an event of default, which could allow holders and lenders, as the case may be, to accelerate the\nrepayment of their debt and could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. An event of default under the ABL Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facility or the Loan Facility would also allow the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit to us under those facilities. If we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under the ABL Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facility or the Loan Facility, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness. In any of these events, we may seek to refinance our indebtedness, but be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms. As a result, we could be: limited in how we conduct our business; unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities; or forced to sell assets.\nThe higher the inflation rate, the more interest rates are likely to rise, which could affect our borrowings and capacity to borrow. In addition, our borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates, primarily based on LIBOR as the reference. LIBOR is subject to national and international proposals for reform that will cause LIBOR to cease to exist after 2023. While we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be available, such as Secured Overnight Financing Rate, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of the development of alternative reference rates, and the transition to an alternative reference rate could result in an increase in our interest expense. The indefinite idling of our Calhoun pulp and paper operations impacts the value of the mill\u2019s assets, which secures our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility; as a result, we may grant additional security under the Senior Secured Credit Facility to compensate for the change in value and maintain the full amount of the credit facility.\nAny downgrade of our credit ratings or economic uncertainty, including resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could lead to greater difficulty in obtaining additional financing on favorable terms.\nWe may be subject to losses that might not be covered in whole or in part by our insurance coverage.\nWe maintain property, business interruption, credit, general liability, casualty, and other types of insurance, including environmental liability, that we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards inherent in our business, including losses resulting from human error, cybersecurity issues, natural disasters, war risks, or terrorist acts. As is typical in the industry, we also do not maintain insurance for any loss to our access to standing timber from natural disasters, regulatory changes, or other causes. Changes in insurance market conditions, including the impact of climate change on the insurance industry, have caused, and may in the future cause, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and in some instances, for certain insurance to become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, we might not be able to finance the amount of the uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all, and might be obligated to divert a significant portion, or all, of our cash flow from normal business operations.\nWe could be required to curtail production, shut down machines or facilities, restructure operations, or sell assets, which could result in recording significant additional closure costs and long-lived asset impairment or accelerated depreciation charges.\nAs part of our corporate strategy or in response to changing market dynamics and structurally declining demand for some of our products or productivity issues, it may be necessary to further curtail production, indefinitely or permanently shut down machines and facilities, restructure operations, or sell assets. In addition to the potential loss of production, curtailments, shutdowns or divestitures could result in long-lived asset or goodwill impairments, accelerated depreciation, inventory write-down and closure costs for the affected facilities, including restructuring charges, exit or disposal costs, and remediation and other environmental costs, which could negatively impact our cash flows and materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. The closure of machines or facilities could also trigger the payment of severance, additional pension contributions or wind-up deficiencies.\nLosses related to the impairment of long-lived assets are recognized when the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. When impairment indicators are triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of the asset group in relation to its expected undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment charge is recognized based on the excess of the asset group\u2019s carrying value over its fair value, if any. If there were to be additional triggering events, we may need to record significant non-cash long-lived asset impairment or accelerated depreciation charges in future periods, which would be recorded as operating expenses and would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe could be required to record goodwill impairment charges on all or a significant amount of the goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe have goodwill of $31 million recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021, all of which arose from the acquisition of our U.S. sawmills. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the estimated fair values of identifiable tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business. Future acquisitions that we could make may also result in significant amounts of additional goodwill. The determination of goodwill involves significant judgment and assumptions. The carrying value of goodwill is not amortized, and is tested for impairment at the reporting unit\u2019s level annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment loss. In the event that the net carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.\nWe could be required to record additional valuation allowances against our recorded deferred income tax assets and we could be limited in our use of certain tax attributes.\nWe recorded significant deferred income tax assets relating to our Canadian operations in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021. If, in the future, we determine that we are unable to recognize these deferred income tax assets as a result of sustained cumulative losses in our Canadian operations, we could be required to record additional valuation allowances for the portion of the deferred income tax assets that is not more likely than not to be realized. Such valuation allowances, if taken, would be recorded as a charge to income tax provision and would adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had significant net operating loss, net capital loss and deduction limitation carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. Our ability to utilize such carryforwards to reduce our tax liability in future years could become subject to significant limitations under \u00a7 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if we undergo an ownership change. An ownership change would occur if, among other things, the stockholders who own, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of Resolute Forest Products Inc.\u2019s common stock, or are otherwise treated as \u201c5% shareholders,\u201d increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding the potential ownership change. Depending on the resulting limitation, a portion of such carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them. Our inability to utilize any net operating loss, net capital loss or deduction limitation carryforwards to reduce tax liability in the future could adversely affect our future financial position and results of operations.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nLegal and compliance risks arise from governmental and regulatory action, operations and business conduct, and contractual and other legal liabilities, including risks associated with: international trade regulation; legal proceedings; our shareholder relationships; commitments to customers, suppliers or other stakeholders; and compliance with securities, governance and other laws and regulations, policies and procedures, such as those relating to financial reporting and disclosure obligations, the environment, forest management, health and safety, marketing, product safety and liability, privacy and antitrust. Governmental and regulatory risk includes the risk that government or regulator actions will impose additional costs on us or cause us to have to change our operations and business models or practices.\nProducts we produce in one country and export to another may become subject to additional duties or other international trade remedies or restrictions.\nWe produce products in the U.S. and Canada, and we sell products worldwide. Under trade and investment treaties and domestic trade laws, custom duties (also called tariffs) can be imposed by national governments where imports are \u201cdumped\u201d or \u201csubsidized\u201d and such imports cause material injury, or an imminent threat of injury, to a domestic industry. International trade laws also generally provide that national governments can adopt countervailing measures, including countervailing duties, with regard to imported products that are subsidized through foreign government programs under certain circumstances. A trade remedy investigation or proceeding may involve allegations of either dumping, subsidization, or both, which are generally initiated at the request of local producers. Where injurious dumping is found, the trade remedy is typically an anti-dumping duty order. Where injurious subsidization is found, the trade remedy is typically a countervailing duty order. In principle, a tariff equal to the amount of dumping or subsidization, as applicable, should be imposed on the importer of the product. Tariffs can be legally challenged before local or international review bodies, but national governments will generally continue levying deposits on estimated customs duties during the pendency of such review proceedings, which can span over many years. Legal rules applicable to tariffs could also be modulated should certain national governments amend their legislation or withdraw from international treaties on tariffs, or should such international treaties be renegotiated or terminated. The imposition of additional customs duties or deposit requirements in respect of estimated duties on one or more of our products could materially affect our cash flow, and the competitive position of our operations relating to the affected product.\nIn addition, national governments could also impose non-tariff measures to restrict the import of some or all of our imported products, such as quotas, tariff-rate quotas, import bans, licensing regimes, price bands or targeted domestic taxes. While such non-tariff measures could be legally challenged under existing trade treaties, non-tariff measures adopted by any country where we sell our products internationally could materially affect our cash flow, and the competitive position of our operations relating to the affected products.\nWe are subject to countervailing and anti-dumping duty orders on the vast majority of our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian sawmills, which could materially affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe vast majority of our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced in Canada are subject to orders requiring us to pay cash deposits to U.S. Customs for estimated countervailing and anti-dumping duties. These cash deposit requirements are the result of petitions filed, shortly after the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement expired in October 2015, by U.S. softwood lumber products producers and forest landowners with Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission.\nAll countervailing and anti-dumping duty orders issued by Commerce in the present softwood lumber dispute have been appealed before a binational review panel established under the North American Free Trade Agreement and its successor, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (or, the \u201cUSMCA\u201d). Deposits paid to U.S. Customs in the present dispute will not be converted into actual duties unless and until appeals have been exhausted.\nWe have been required to pay cash deposits for estimated countervailing duties and anti-dumping duties on the vast majority of our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian sawmills, since April 28, 2017, and June 30, 2017, respectively. Subsequently, Commerce maintained cash deposits at varying rates as a result of annual administrative reviews; following the initial investigation, we were subject to four administrative reviews and could remain subject to further administrative reviews for years to come. As of December 31, 2021, the rates for estimated countervailing and anti-dumping duties applicable to our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products were 18.07% and 11.59%, respectively and cumulatively. These rates will apply until Commerce sets new duty rates in subsequent administrative reviews, or until new rates are set on appeal through a remand determination by the binational review panel established under the USMCA. Commerce is expected to issue its final determination in the third administrative reviews of the countervailing and antidumping investigations in the third or fourth quarter of 2022, following which new rates will take effect for Resolute; the new rates were estimated at 15.48% for countervailing duties and 4.76% for antidumping duties in a non-binding, preliminary determination released on January 31, 2022, but are subject to modification in the upcoming final determinations. Through December 31, 2021, our aggregate cash deposits paid to the U.S. for all affected products totaled $397 million.\nWe cannot provide any assurance regarding the estimated or final duty rates that may be determined by Commerce in its future administrative reviews. During any period in which our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products from our Canadian sawmills are subject to countervailing or anti-dumping cash deposit requirements or duty requirements, our cash flows and the competitive position of those products and our related Canadian operations could be materially affected.\nAny failure to comply with laws and regulations could require us to incur or record additional liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of foreign, federal or national, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations dealing with financial reporting and disclosure obligations, corporate governance, antitrust, customs and trade, employees, contractors, transportation, taxes, timber and water rights, pensions, benefit plans, workplace health and safety, the manufacture and sale of consumer products, including product safety and liability, the environment, and Indigenous peoples, among others. Many of these laws and regulations are complex and subject to differing interpretation, and the requirements of laws and regulations of different countries and jurisdictions in which we operate, have sales or otherwise do business, or in which our securities trade or in which our security holders reside, may differ or be inconsistent with one another. Compliance with these laws and regulations, including changes to them or their interpretations or enforcement, or introduction of new laws and regulations, has required in the past, and could require in the future, substantial expenditures by us and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, noncompliance with laws and regulations could significantly damage and require us to spend substantial amounts of money to rebuild our reputation.\nOur ability to comply with these laws and regulations often depends, at least in part, on compliance by independent third parties, such as contractors and agents we retain to provide services. For example, our compliance with customs requirements for international shipments depends in part on compliance by our customs brokers, sureties, transportation companies, and external advisors, in addition to our own employees and consultants, and we could be liable for noncompliance by any of them, even if inadvertent. Failure to comply with laws and regulations can also be the result of unintended consequences, such as unforeseen consequences of information technology modifications, upgrades, or replacements. Although we strive to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, no company, including ours, can assure that it will successfully prevent, detect, or\nremediate all potential instances of non-compliance, and any failure to do so could be material, require substantial expenditures, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs an owner of real estate and industrial facilities, we could be required to incur or record additional environmental and related health and safety liabilities.\nAs an owner and operator of real estate and industrial facilities, we are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations relating to pollution and the protection of the environment, as well as several requirements stipulated in our facilities\u2019 permits, including those governing air emissions, water usage, wastewater discharges, the storage, management and disposal of regulated substances and waste, the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites, landfill and wastewater treatment system operation and closure, forest management and operations, endangered species and their habitat, health and safety, carbon pricing and climate change. Changes to our operations and costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as the requirements of these laws and regulations evolve. Noncompliance with these regulations or permit conditions can result in significant civil, administrative or criminal fines or penalties, or regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations. This may include liability under environmental laws for cleanup, improvement or change of pollution control equipment, and other costs and damages, including investigation costs, tort liability and damages to natural resources, resulting from past or present spills, releases or threats of releases of regulated substances and waste on or from our current or former properties or operations. We may also be liable under health and safety laws for related exposure of employees, contractors and other persons to substances and waste on or from our current or former properties or injuries. We may incur liability under these laws without regard to whether we knew of, were responsible for, or owned the property at the time of, any exposure, spill, release or threats of releases of any regulated substances or waste on or from any current or former property, or at properties where we arranged for the disposal of regulated materials or waste. Claims or liability may also arise out of currently unknown environmental conditions, obligations arising as a result of new or revised rules or regulations (e.g. regulation of perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances and extended producer responsibility legislation in the U.S.) or aggressive enforcement efforts by government regulators, public interest groups or private parties. As a result, we may be required to incur or record additional environmental or related health and safety liabilities.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls, and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nAs a result of our international sales and operations, we are required to comply with trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S., Canada, and other governments or organizations. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada), the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials and, in some jurisdictions, to other commercial parties. Changes in trade sanctions laws could restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions, including fines, loss of authorizations needed to conduct our international business, and other penalties, as well as result in a default under certain of our financing agreements, each of which could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are and may become a party to a number of legal proceedings, claims, governmental inquiries, investigations, and other disputes, and adverse judgments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe become involved in various legal proceedings, claims, governmental inquiries, investigations, and other disputes in the normal course of business. These could include, for example, matters related to contracts, transactions, commercial and trade disputes, taxes, environmental and climate change issues, activist\u2019s claims for damages, employment and workers\u2019 compensation claims, grievances, human rights complaints, pension and benefit plans and obligations, health and safety, product safety and liability, asbestos exposure, intellectual property, financial reporting and disclosure obligations, corporate governance, Indigenous peoples\u2019 claims, antitrust, governmental regulations, and other matters. In addition to claims against us and our consolidated subsidiaries, these matters may involve claims asserted by others against unconsolidated partnerships, investments in companies where we have significant influence or joint ventures. Although the final outcome of these matters is subject to many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, we regularly assess the status of the matters and establish provisions (including legal costs expected to be incurred) when we believe an adverse outcome is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect if not resolved in our favor, or that we believe to be significant, are discussed in Item 3 of this Form 10-K and in Note 18, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies - Legal matters\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, our reports do not disclose or discuss all matters of which we are aware. If our assessment of the probable outcome or materiality of a matter is not correct, we may not have made adequate provision for such loss and our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, if a loss resulting from an adverse outcome in connection with a matter were to affect the solvency of certain of our subsidiaries or remain unpaid for certain periods, it could result in a default under the ABL Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the indenture governing the 2026 Notes or the Loan Facility.\nSome matters that we may be involved in from time to time result from claims brought by us against third parties, including customers, suppliers, shareholders, governments or governmental agencies, activists and others. Even if such a matter does not involve a claim for damages or other penalty or remedial action against us, such a matter could nevertheless adversely affect our relationships with those and other third parties.\nThere is a shareholder who owns a substantial percentage of our common stock, and its interests could differ from those of other stockholders, and its actions could affect the price of our common stock.\nThere is a shareholder who owns a substantial percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and could increase its percentage ownership even further. This shareholder could be in a position to influence the outcome of actions requiring shareholder approval, including, among other things, the election of board members. The concentration of ownership could also facilitate or hinder a negotiated change of control and consequently, impact the value of our common stock. In addition, the possibility that this shareholder may sell all or a large portion of our common stock in a short period of time may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 66130, "SIC": 2621, "TIC": "RFP"}
