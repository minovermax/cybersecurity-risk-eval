RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock or debt securities.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, material adverse consequences for general economic, financial, and business conditions, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity and those of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and the responses of governmental authorities and companies, as well as the self-imposed restrictions by many individuals across the world to stem the spread of the virus, have significantly reduced global economic activity; as a result, there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of businesses open for operation, and substantially fewer people across the world have been traveling to work or leaving their homes to procure or provide goods and services. This has resulted, for example, in a dramatic reduction in airline flights and has reduced the number of cars on the road. As a result, there has been a decline in the demand for, and thus also the market prices of, crude oil and certain of our products, particularly the refined petroleum products that we manufacture and sell.\nConcerns over the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic and business prospects across the world have contributed to increased market and crude oil price volatility and have diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, coupled with the emergence of decreasing business and consumer confidence and increasing unemployment resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak and the increase in crude oil price volatility, have precipitated an economic slowdown. The current economic slowdown and period of depressed prices for crude oil and most of our products has had, and may continue to have, significant adverse consequences on our financial condition and the financial condition of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. This has also had, and may continue to have, a\nnegative effect on our liquidity and our ability to obtain adequate crude oil volumes and other feedstock supplies and to market certain of our products at favorable prices, or at all.\nDeclines in the market prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, and products below their carrying values in our inventory have required, and may continue to require, us to make certain valuation adjustments (e.g., lower of cost or market (LCM) inventory valuation adjustments) to write down the value of our inventories. This has in turn had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our operating income. The decline in the price of the refined products we sell and the feedstocks we purchase has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on other areas of our business and results of operation, such as our revenues and cost of sales. In addition, a sustained period of low crude oil prices, such as we experienced in 2020, may also result in significant financial constraints on certain producers from which we acquire our crude oil, which could result in long term crude oil supply constraints for our business. Such conditions could also result in an increased risk that customers, lenders, service and insurance providers, and other counterparties, such as counterparties to our commodity hedging or derivative instruments, or other agreements vital to our operations, may be unable to fully fulfil their obligations in a timely manner, or at all. Any of the foregoing events or conditions, or other unforeseen consequences of COVID-19, could significantly adversely affect our business and financial condition and the business and financial condition of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties.\nWhile in the latter part of the second quarter of 2020 certain governmental authorities in the U.S. and abroad began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19, which resulted in an increase in the demand and market prices for most of our products relative to what we experienced during the first several months of the pandemic, developments with respect to COVID-19 have been occurring at a rapid pace and the risk remains that circumstances could change. For instance, many locations where restrictions were lifted, and others where the restrictions were more moderately lifted (such as California in our U.S. West Coast region, and New York, Canada, and the U.K. in our North Atlantic region), have experienced a resurgence in the spread of COVID-19 prompting many governmental authorities to re-impose certain restrictions that had previously been lifted or softened. In addition, in December 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Canadian and U.K. regulators each granted emergency-use authorization for multiple COVID-19 vaccines to be used as immunization against the virus. Although these vaccines may be seen as a key factor in helping to restore public confidence, and thus stimulate and increase economic activity, potentially to pre-pandemic levels, they may not be distributed widely on a timely basis and they may not be effective against new variants of the COVID-19 virus.\nMany uncertainties remain with respect to COVID-19, including its resulting economic effects, and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts from COVID-19 on our business and how quickly national economies can recover once the pandemic subsides, the timing or effectiveness of vaccine distributions, the potential for new variants of the virus or whether any recovery will ultimately experience a reversal or other setbacks. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, particularly within the geographic areas where we operate, and the related impact on overall economic activity, all of which are currently unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. However, the adverse impacts of the economic effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty in the global oil markets on our business have been and will likely continue to be significant.\nThe adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity have also had, and may continue to have, the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the other risk factors below, as those risk factors are amended or supplemented by\nsubsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports and documents we file with the U.S. SEC after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Operations\nOur financial results are affected by volatile margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including the price of crude oil, corn, and other feedstocks and the market price at which we can sell our products.\nOur financial results are affected by the relationship, or margin, between our product prices and the prices for crude oil, corn, and other feedstocks. Historically, refining and ethanol margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future. Our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, corn, other feedstocks, gasoline, diesel, other refined petroleum products, and renewable products. These in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of U.S. and international suppliers, levels of product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of U.S. and global economies, U.S. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation. The ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls has also had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the market prices of crude oil and certain of our products.\nSome of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. The longer-term effects of these and other factors on product margins are uncertain. We do not produce crude oil, corn, or all of our other feedstocks and must purchase all of the feedstocks we process. We generally purchase our feedstocks long before we process them and sell the resulting products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the resulting products has had, and in the future could continue to have, a significant effect on our financial results. A decline in market prices, as was experienced during much of 2020, negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the carrying value of our inventories.\nEconomic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the U.S. and other countries. Lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and consumption of our products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects.\nRefining, renewable diesel, and ethanol margins also can be significantly impacted by additional conversion capacity through the expansion of existing facilities or the construction of new refineries or plants. Worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined petroleum product demand, which would have an adverse effect on refining margins.\nA significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils, such as Louisiana Light Sweet (LLS) and Brent crude oils. These crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined petroleum products, and have declined in certain periods, as was the case for much of 2020, and could again decline in the future. Previous declines have had, and any future declines would again have, a negative impact on our results of operations.\nLegal, technological, and political developments and evolving market sentiment regarding fuel efficiency and low-carbon fuel standards may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our performance.\nMany state, provincial, and national governments across the world have imposed, and may impose in the future, increases in fuel economy standards, low-carbon fuel standards, restrictions on vehicles using petroleum-based fuel, and other policies or regulations (such as tax incentives or subsidies) aimed at steering the public towards less petroleum-dependent modes of transportation, which could reduce demand for our products. For example, in September 2020 the governor of California issued an executive order seeking to require that sales of all new passenger vehicles be zero-emission by 2035 and medium to heavy duty vehicles be zero-emission by 2045 where feasible. The executive order also requires state agencies to build out sufficient electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Other governmental authorities, such as the U.K. and Quebec, have also announced intentions to adopt similar restrictions with respect to the sale of new combustion-engine vehicles. A reduction in the demand for our products could also result from a shift by consumers to alternative fuel vehicles, whether as a result of technological or scientific advances, consumer or investor sentiment towards our products and their relationship to the environment, or legislation or regulation mandating or encouraging the use of alternative energy sources. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate form, timing, or extent of any such governmental, consumer, or investor actions. However, a reduction in the demand for our products as a result of any of the foregoing events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nDevelopments with respect to low-carbon fuel policies and the market for alternative fuels may affect demand for our renewable fuels and could adversely affect our financial performance.\nLow-carbon fuel policies, blending credits, and stricter fuel efficiency standards to help reach GHG emissions reduction targets help drive demand for our renewable fuels. Any changes to, a failure to enforce, or a discontinuation of any of these policies, goals, and initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our renewable fuels businesses. Similarly, new or changing technologies may be developed, consumers may shift to alternative fuels or alternative fuel vehicles (such as electric or hybrid vehicles) other than the renewable fuels we produce, and there may be new entrants into the renewable fuels production industry that could meet demand for lower-carbon transportation fuels and modes of transportation in a more efficient or less costly manner than our technologies and products, which could also have a material adverse effect on our renewable fuels businesses. For instance, several other refiners have made, or announced interest in, investments in renewable diesel projects. Should these projects develop, we would face competition from them for feedstocks and customers. While such developments are currently uncertain, a reduction in the demand for our renewable fuels or increased competition for feedstocks could adversely affect our financial performance.\nInvestor sentiment towards climate change, fossil fuels, and other ESG matters could adversely affect our business, cost of capital, and the price of our stock and other securities.\nThere have been efforts in recent years, which have intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities, and other groups, to promote the divestment of securities of energy companies, as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with energy companies. As a result, some financial intermediaries, investors, and other capital markets participants have reduced or ceased lending to, or investing in, companies that operate in industries with higher perceived environmental exposure, such as the energy industry. For example, in December 2020, the state\nof New York announced that it will be divesting the state\u2019s Common Retirement Fund from fossil fuels. If this or similar divestment efforts are continued, the price of our common stock or debt securities, and our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain new investment or financing, may be negatively impacted.\nMembers of the investment community are also increasing their focus on ESG practices and disclosures, including practices and disclosures related to GHGs and climate change in the energy industry in particular, and diversity and inclusion initiatives and governance standards among companies more generally. As a result, we may face increasing pressure regarding our ESG practices and disclosures. Additionally, members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for ESG performance before investing in our common stock or debt securities, or lending to us. Over the past few years there has also been an acceleration in investor demand for ESG investing opportunities, and many large institutional investors have committed to increasing the percentage of their portfolios that are allocated towards ESG-focused investments. As a result, there has been a proliferation of ESG-focused investment funds seeking ESG-oriented investment products.\nIf we are unable to meet the ESG standards or investment or lending criteria set by these investors and funds, we may lose investors, investors may allocate a portion of their capital away from us, our cost of capital may increase, the price of our common stock and debt securities may be negatively impacted, and our reputation may also be negatively affected.\nDisruption of our ability to obtain crude oil, rendered and recycled materials, corn, and other feedstocks could adversely affect our operations.\nA significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, these areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional feedstock supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including from reduced sales volumes of products or reduced margins as a result of higher costs.\nIn addition, the U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries. For instance, U.S. sanctions with respect to Iran and Venezuela currently limit the ability of U.S. companies to engage in oil transactions involving these countries. These restrictions, and those of other governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the U.S. and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future.\nWhile Darling, our joint venture partner in DGD, supplies some of DGD\u2019s feedstock at competitive pricing, DGD must still secure a significant amount of supply from other sources. Should Darling\u2019s supply be disrupted or should supply from other sources become limited or only available at unfavorable terms, DGD could be required to develop alternate sources of supply. While DGD does not believe feedstock supply is likely to be disrupted, such an event could have an adverse impact on DGD\u2019s, and therefore our, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur ethanol segment relies on corn sourced from local farmers and commercial elevators in the Mid-Continent region of the U.S. As a result, the feedstock supply of our ethanol segment is acutely exposed to the effects that weather and other environmental events occurring in that region, as well as applicable governmental policies such as farming subsidies, can have on crop production. Any reduction in crop production from these or similar events could reduce the supply of, or otherwise increase our costs to obtain, feedstocks for our ethanol segment.\nWe are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and other feedstocks and the products that we manufacture.\nWe use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our refineries and plants and to transport the products we manufacture to market. If we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market, or if the ability of the pipelines, vessels, trucks, or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, derailments, collisions, fires, explosions, governmental regulations, or third-party actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nCompetitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, own their own retail sites, have greater financial resources, or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage.\nThe refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets. We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for retail sites for our refined petroleum products. We do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and we do not have a company-owned retail network. Many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have extensive retail sites. Such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and they may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.\nSome of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. Such competitors may have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.\nA significant interruption in one or more of our refineries or renewable diesel or ethanol plants could adversely affect our business.\nOur refineries, renewable diesel plant, and ethanol plants are our principal operating assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries or plants were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. If any refinery or plant were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery or plant could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. Significant interruptions in our refining, renewable diesel, or ethanol systems could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil, rendered and recycled materials, corn, and many of our products.\nLarge capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate over time, negatively impacting project returns.\nWe may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project. Large-scale projects take many years to complete, and market conditions can change from our forecast. As a result, we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur investments in joint ventures and other entities decrease our ability to manage risk.\nWe conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners. We also conduct some of our operations through entities in which we have no ownership. Our joint venture partners may have economic, business or legal interests, or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations. For instance, while we operate the DGD Plant and perform certain day-to-day operating and management functions for DGD as an independent contractor, we do not have full control with respect to every aspect of DGD\u2019s business and certain large actions concerning DGD, including, among others, the acquisition or disposition of assets above a certain value threshold, making certain changes to DGD\u2019s business plan, raising debt or equity capital, DGD\u2019s distribution policy, and entering into particular transactions, which currently require certain approvals from Darling. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with joint ventures, and any differences in views among us and our joint venture partners, which could prevent or delay actions that are in the best interest of us or the joint venture, could have a material adverse effect on our, or our joint ventures\u2019, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions.\nWe currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. If the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us.\nLegal, Governmental, and Regulatory Risks\nCompliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, and climate change litigation could adversely affect our performance.\nThe principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of fuels, including gasoline and diesel. Certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct assessment or remediation efforts at our refineries and plants as well as at formerly owned properties or third-party sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated. Environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned.\nBecause environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to GHG emissions and climate change, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. Shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change. President Biden has also signed an executive order requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the previous administration, and the current administration has issued a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the current administration has reviewed and approved the rule. President Biden\u2019s executive orders, as well as the U.S.\u2019s reentry into the Paris Agreement as discussed below, may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations.\nCurrent and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. We may be required to make expenditures to modify operations, discontinue use of certain process units, or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nFor example, in 2015, the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the U.S. in April 2016, requires countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set GHG emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. In November 2019, the previous administration served notice on the United Nations that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which ultimately occurred in 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an instrument that reverses this withdrawal, and the U.S. formally rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021. The U.S.\u2019s reentry into the Paris Agreement may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations. Additionally, the Paris Agreement may affect our operations in Canada, the U.K., Ireland, and Latin America. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various U.S. states, at the U.S. federal level, or in other countries could also adversely affect the oil and gas industry.\nWe could also face increased climate-related litigation with respect to our operations or products. Governmental and other entities in various U.S. states such as California and New York have filed lawsuits against coal, gas, oil, and petroleum companies. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change, and the plaintiffs seek damages and abatement under various tort theories. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. While we are currently not a party to any of these lawsuits, they present a high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent to which energy companies face an increased risk of liability stemming from climate change, which risk would also adversely impact the oil and gas industry.\nCompliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) could adversely affect our performance.\nThe U.S. EPA has implemented the RFS pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the U.S. A Renewable Identification Number (RIN) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the U.S. As a producer of petroleum-based transportation fuels, we are obligated to blend renewable fuels\ninto the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the U.S. EPA\u2019s quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase RINs in the market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program. The U.S. EPA missed its November 30, 2020, statutory deadline to set the 2021 renewable volume obligations (RVOs) establishing the volume of renewable fuels refiners must blend into their fuel mix in 2021 and, to date, has not issued a proposed rule for the 2021 RVO. While there are statutory targets still in place, the ultimate RVO for 2021 and the potential costs associated therewith remain uncertain until the RVO is set.\nWe are exposed to the volatility in the market price of RINs. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. RINs prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including U.S. EPA regulations, the availability of RINs for purchase, and levels of transportation fuels produced, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The ultimate outcome of the 2021 RVO rule will also likely affect RIN prices. If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase, if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the U.S. EPA\u2019s RFS mandates, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe current administration has also been critical of exemptions from the RFS mandates granted to small refineries during the previous administration. While litigation over the issue is currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. EPA under the current administration may be less willing to grant such waivers going forward and may increase the RVO obligations in future years. To the extent fewer waivers are granted in the future or RVO obligations are increased, the demand for and the price of RINs would likely also increase, and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAny attempt by the U.S. government to withdraw from, re-enter, materially modify any existing international trade agreements, or enter into any new international trade agreements in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe previous administration questioned certain existing and proposed trade agreements. For example, the administration withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In addition, the previous administration implemented and proposed various trade tariffs, which have resulted in foreign governments responding with tariffs on U.S. goods.\nChanges in U.S. social, political, regulatory, and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development, and investment could adversely affect our business. For example, the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers with other countries could affect our ability to obtain feedstocks from international sources, increase our costs, and reduce the competitiveness of our products.\nWhile there is currently a lack of certainty around the likelihood, timing, and details of any such policies and reforms, if the current U.S. administration takes action to withdraw from, re-enter, or materially modify any existing international trade agreements, or to enter into any new international trade agreements in the future, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes (VAT)), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in\nexisting tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Although we believe we have used reasonable interpretations and assumptions in calculating our tax liabilities, the final determination of these tax audits and any related proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Any adverse outcome of such tax audits or related proceedings could result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities that may, individually or in the aggregate, materially affect our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, and financial condition. Tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate may change significantly as a result of political or economic factors beyond our control. It is also possible that future changes to tax laws (including tax treaties with any of the jurisdictions in which we operate) could impact our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date. Additionally, our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws (including tax treaties) or their interpretations.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect interest rates.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. In the future, we may need to renegotiate our financial agreements, including, but not limited to, our $4.0 billion revolving credit facility, or incur other indebtedness, and we may be required to select and use a replacement reference rate for certain other outstanding debt. The phase-out of LIBOR or the use of any replacement reference rate may negatively impact the terms of, and our ability to refinance, such indebtedness and could also adversely affect the interest rate payable on, and the liquidity and value of, such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market and the ability to raise future indebtedness in a cost effective manner may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nChanges in the U.K.\u2019s economic and other relationships with the European Union (EU) could adversely affect us.\nIn June 2016, the U.K. elected to withdraw from the EU in a national referendum (Brexit). The U.K. withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020, consistent with the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement, with a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020. On January 1, 2021, the U.K. left the EU Single Market and Customs Union as well as all EU policies and international agreements. As a result, the free movement of persons, goods, services, and capital between the U.K. and the EU ended, and the EU and the U.K. formed two separate markets and two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. On December 24, 2020, the European Commission reached a trade agreement with the U.K. on the terms of its future cooperation with the EU. The trade agreement offers U.K. and EU companies preferential access to each other\u2019s markets, ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas (subject to rules of origin requirements). The ultimate impact of this trade agreement, and the broader economic and regulatory consequences of Brexit, however, are currently unknown, and it is possible that such effects and consequences could ultimately adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\nCyber Security and Privacy Related Risks\nA significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack, which could result in (i) a loss of intellectual property, proprietary information, or employee, customer or vendor data; (ii) public disclosure of sensitive information; (iii) increased costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity events, such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants; (iv) systems interruption; (v) disruption of our business operations; (vi) remediation costs for repairs of system damage; (vii) reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence; and (viii) damage to our competitiveness, stock price, and long-term stockholder value. A breach could also originate from, or compromise, our customers\u2019 and vendors\u2019 or other third-party networks outside of our control. A breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders, employees, customers, vendors, and governmental authorities (U.S. and non-U.S.). There can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention. To the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could expose us to increased liability, subject us to lawsuits, investigations, and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business.\nAlong with our own data and information in the normal course of our business, we collect and retain certain data that is subject to specific laws and regulations. The transfer and use of this data both domestically and across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. This data is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state, international, provincial, and local levels in many areas of our business, including data privacy and security laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\nThe GDPR applies to activities regarding personal data that may be conducted by us, directly or indirectly through vendors and subcontractors, from an establishment in the EU. As interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR evolves, it creates a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to incur additional costs. Failure to comply could result in significant penalties of up to a maximum of 4 percent of our global turnover that may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, gives California residents specific rights in relation to their personal information, requires that companies take certain actions, including notifications for security incidents, and may apply to activities regarding personal information that is collected by us, directly or indirectly, from California residents. As interpretation and enforcement of the CCPA evolves, it creates a range of new compliance obligations, with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe GDPR and CCPA, as well as other data privacy laws that may become applicable to our business, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners.\nOur ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. Our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. Protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. In addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements.\nOur access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We currently maintain investment-grade ratings by Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings on our senior unsecured debt. Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Specifically, if ratings agencies were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs may increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease. In addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security, which would increase our operating costs. As a result, a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nFrom time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. From time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. We have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. In addition, we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements. Uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nSevere weather events may have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.\nSevere weather events, such as storms, hurricanes, droughts, or floods, could have an adverse effect on our operations and could increase our costs. For instance, severe weather events can have an impact on crops production and reduce the supply of, or otherwise increase our costs to obtain, feedstocks for our ethanol and renewable diesel segments. If climate changes result in more intense or frequent severe weather events, the physical and disruptive effects could have a material adverse impact on our operations and assets.\nOur business may be negatively affected by work stoppages, slowdowns, or strikes by our employees, as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators.\nCertain workers at five of our U.S. refineries, as well as at each of our Canadian and U.K. refineries, are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements, which generally have unique and independent expiration dates. To the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future, there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike, work stoppage, or other labor action. Any prolonged strike, work stoppage, or other labor action at our facilities or at facilities owned or operated by third parties that support our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, future federal, state, or foreign labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs, especially during critical maintenance periods.\nWe are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards. Failure by one or more insurers to honor their coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. As protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses and liabilities. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. Significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. We can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events.", "PERMNO": 85269, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "VLO"}
