Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including our financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the following risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and future prospects could be materially harmed, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks, as more fully described in this section below this summary. You should read these risks before you invest in our common stock. We may be unable, for many reasons, including those that are beyond our control, to implement our business strategy. In particular, our risks include:\n\u25cf\nOur business is being adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u25cf\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception, anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses in 2021 and may continue to incur losses in the future\n\u25cf\nWe have not yet generated significant product revenue and may never be profitable.\n\u25cf\nWe will require additional capital and may be unable to raise capital, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our commercialization efforts and product development programs and could cause us to cease operations.\n\u25cf\nPositive clinical results obtained to date for Zalviso may be disputed in FDA review, do not guarantee regulatory approval and may not be obtained from future clinical trials.\n\u25cf\nExisting and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our products and affect the prices we may obtain.\n\u25cf\nGuidelines and recommendations published by government agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, and existing laws and regulations can reduce the use of DSUVIA, and Zalviso, if approved in the United States.\n\u25cf\nZalviso may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance. DSUVIA may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could limit market acceptance.\n\u25cf\nAlthough we have obtained regulatory approval for DSUVIA, and even if we obtain regulatory approval for Zalviso in the United States, we and our collaborators face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\n\u25cf\nThe commercial success of DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, as well as DZUVEO and Zalviso in Europe, will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, nurses, patients, and pharmacy and therapeutics committees.\n\u25cf\nIf we are unable to maintain or grow our sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products, we may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue.\n\u25cf\nA key part of our business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and fund development and approval of our products, particularly outside of the United States. We may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships, which may significantly limit our ability to develop and commercialize our products successfully, if at all.\n\u25cf\nIf we cannot defend our issued patents from third party claims or if our pending patent applications fail to issue, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u25cf\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile.\nRisks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business is being adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business has been adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Federal, state, local and foreign government orders on account of the COVID-19 pandemic are preventing us from conducting certain activities and obtaining supplies required to manufacture and deliver certain components for Zalviso. Furthermore, following local and state government orders in California and the counties in which our corporate office is located and many of our employees live, we implemented work from home policies, which are limiting certain of our operations. If the COVID-19 outbreak continues, we may need to limit operations further and implement additional limitations, such as extending our work from home policies. Moreover, some hospitals and other healthcare facilities have implemented policies that limit access of our representatives to such facilities, which is causing a delay to, and thwarting, our educational and promotional efforts with respect to such facilities. Some governments, hospitals and doctors, as a measure to combat the further spread of COVID-19, have reduced the number of procedures in which DSUVIA is administered as part of the pain treatment program, and temporarily halted performing elective surgeries, which will adversely impact the levels of our sales relating to such procedures. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of DSUVIA\u00ae and Zalviso\u00ae\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize DSUVIA. To the extent DSUVIA is not commercially successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed.\nWe invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources to develop and gain regulatory approval for DSUVIA and expect to continue making significant investments to commercialize DSUVIA. We believe our success is highly dependent on, and a significant portion of the value of our company relates to, our ability to successfully commercialize DSUVIA in the United States. The commercial success of DSUVIA depends heavily on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022 our ability to market, sell, and distribute DSUVIA;\n\u2022 our ability to establish and maintain commercial manufacturing with third parties;\n\u2022 acceptance of DSUVIA by physicians, patients and the healthcare community;\n\u2022 acceptance of pricing and placement of DSUVIA on payers\u2019 formularies;\n\u2022 our ability to effectively compete with other medications for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically supervised settings, including IV-opioids and any subsequently approved products;\n\u2022 effective management of, and compliance with, the DSUVIA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program;\n\u2022 continued demonstration of an acceptable safety profile of DSUVIA; and\n\u2022 our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce, and defend our intellectual property rights and claims.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and other healthcare facilities have barred visitors that are not caregivers or mission-critical and we have no visibility as to when these restrictions on access will be lifted for all of our customers. As a result, our commercial and medical affairs teams\u2019 educational and promotional efforts have been substantially reduced, and in some cases, stopped. As a result, we expect our near-term sales volumes to be adversely impacted for as long as access to healthcare facilities by our commercial and medical affairs personnel continues to be limited.\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize DSUVIA, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially harmed.\nThe commercial success of DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, as well as DZUVEO and Zalviso in Europe, will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, nurses, patients, and pharmacy and therapeutics committees.\nThe degree of market acceptance of DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, or DZUVEO and Zalviso in Europe, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n\u2022 the relative convenience, ease of administration and acceptance by physicians, patients and health care payers;\n\u2022 the use of DSUVIA for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain by a healthcare professional for patient types that were not specifically studied in our Phase 3 trials;\n\u2022 the use of Zalviso for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in the hospital setting for patient types that were not specifically studied in our Phase 3 trials;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any adverse events, or AEs, or serious adverse events, or SAEs;\n\u2022 overcoming any perceptions of sufentanil as a potentially unsafe drug due to its high potency opioid status;\n\u2022 limitations or warnings contained in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, -approved label for DSUVIA, or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA,-approved label for DZUVEO or Zalviso;\n\u2022 restrictions or limitations placed on DSUVIA due to the REMS program;\n\u2022 availability of alternative treatments;\n\u2022 existing capital investment by hospitals in IV PCA technology;\n\u2022 pricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain formulary approval; and,\n\u2022 our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage and reimbursement.\nIf our approved products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, nurses, patients and pharmacy and therapeutics committees, we may not generate sufficient revenue and become or remain profitable.\nIf we are unable to maintain or grow our sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products, we may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue.\nIn order to commercialize DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, we must maintain or grow internal sales, marketing, distribution, managerial and other capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We have entered into agreements with third parties for the distribution of DSUVIA and plan to enter into such agreements for Zalviso, if approved, in the United States; however, if these third parties do not perform as expected or there are delays in establishing such relationships for Zalviso, if approved, our ability to effectively distribute products would suffer.\nWe entered into a collaboration with Gr\u00fcnenthal for the commercialization of Zalviso in Europe and Australia and, during the three months ended June 30, 2020, Gr\u00fcnenthal terminated the collaboration, effective November 13, 2020. The terms of the Gr\u00fcnenthal Agreements were extended to May 2021 to enable Gr\u00fcnenthal to sell down its Zalviso inventory, a right it had under the Gr\u00fcnenthal Agreements. The rights to market and sell Zalviso in the Territory revert back to us in May 2021. We intend to enter into additional strategic partnerships with third parties to commercialize our products outside of the United States, including a replacement license agreement for Zalviso in Europe. Per the terms of royalty monetization arrangement with PDL BioPharma, Inc., or PDL, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a replacement license agreement. Accordingly, even if we are able to enter into a replacement license agreement, and that licensee is successful in commercializing Zalviso in Europe, we will receive only a portion of any royalties until the capped amount owing to PDL is reached. On August 31, 2020, PDL announced it sold its royalty interest for Zalviso to SWK Funding, LLC, or SWK. The EC granted marketing approval of DZUVEO in June 2018. We have not yet entered into a collaboration agreement with a strategic partner for the commercialization of DZUVEO in Europe, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully enter into such an agreement. We may also consider the option to enter into strategic partnerships for DSUVIA, or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and these strategic partnerships can be intricate and time consuming to negotiate and document.\nWe may not be able to negotiate future strategic partnerships on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any strategic partnerships because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic partnerships. Our current or future collaboration partners, if any, may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of Zalviso or DSUVIA/DZUVEO, or may otherwise fail in their commercialization due to factors beyond our control. If we are unable to establish effective collaborations to enable the sale of our products to healthcare professionals and in geographical regions that will not be covered by our own marketing and sales force, or if our potential future collaboration partners do not successfully commercialize our products, our ability to generate revenues from product sales will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain or grow adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and become profitable. We compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nIn March 2020, we reduced the size of our commercial team and, given our reduced workforce, we may experience difficulties in retaining our existing employees and managing our operations, including our continued commercialization of DSUVIA.\nIn March 2020, we reduced the size of our commercial team to eliminate the overlap with the Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. commercial team under our co-promotion arrangement and reduce operating expenses. The restructuring resulted in the elimination of 30 positions, or approximately 33% of our workforce. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 25 sales representatives, including those under the Promotion Agreement with La Jolla.\nWe will need to retain and maintain our existing sales, managerial, operational, finance and other personnel and resources in order to continue the commercialization of DSUVIA and manage our operations. Our current infrastructure may be inadequate to support our strategy and our workforce reduction may be disruptive to our operations, may negatively affect our productivity, and constrain our commercialization activities. For example, our workforce reduction could yield unanticipated consequences, such as attrition beyond planned staff reductions, negative impact on employee morale and our corporate culture, or increase difficulties in our day-to-day operations and prevent us from successfully commercializing DSUVIA as rapidly as planned. If we encounter such unanticipated consequences, we may have difficulty retaining and attracting personnel. In addition, the implementation of any additional workforce or expense reduction programs may divert the efforts of our management team and other key employees, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our cost structure from our cost reduction plan, due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from the cost reduction plan, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by government agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, and existing laws and regulations can reduce the use of DSUVIA, and Zalviso, if approved in the United States.\nGovernment agencies and non-governmental organizations promulgate regulations and guidelines applicable to certain drug classes that may include DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved in the United States. Recommendations of government agencies or non-governmental organizations may relate to such matters as maximum quantities dispensed to patients, dosage, route of administration, and use of concomitant therapies. Government agencies and non-governmental organizations have offered commentary and guidelines on the use of opioid-containing products. We are uncertain how these activities and guidelines may impact DSUVIA and our ability to gain marketing approval of Zalviso in the United States. Regulations or guidelines suggesting the reduced use of certain drug classes that may include DSUVIA or Zalviso, or the use of competitive or alternative products as the standard-of-care to be followed by patients and healthcare providers, could result in decreased use of DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, or negatively impact our ability to gain market acceptance and market share. The U.S. government and state legislatures have prioritized combatting the growing misuse and addiction to opioids and opioid overdose deaths and have enacted legislation and regulations as well as other measures intended to fight the opioid epidemic. Addressing opioid drug abuse is a priority for the current U.S. administration and the FDA and is part of a broader initiative led by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. Overall, there is greater scrutiny of entities involved in the manufacture, sale and distribution of opioids. These initiatives, existing laws and regulations, and any negative publicity related to opioids may have a material impact on our business and our ability to manufacture opioid products.\nGovernmental investigations, inquiries, and regulatory actions and lawsuits brought against us by government agencies and private parties with respect to our commercialization of opioids could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of greater public awareness of the public health issue of opioid abuse, there has been increased scrutiny of, and investigation into, the commercial practices of opioid manufacturers by state and federal agencies. As a result of our manufacturing and commercial sale of DSUVIA in the United States and Zalviso in Europe, we could become the subject of federal, state and foreign government investigations and enforcement actions, focused on the misuse and abuse of opioid medications.\nIn addition, a significant number of lawsuits have been filed against opioid manufacturers, distributors, and others in the supply chain by cities, counties, state Attorney's General and private persons seeking to hold them accountable for opioid misuse and abuse. The lawsuits assert a variety of claims, including, but not limited to, public nuisance, negligence, civil conspiracy, fraud, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, or similar state laws, violations of state Controlled Substance Acts or state False Claims Acts, product liability, consumer fraud, unfair or deceptive trade practices, false advertising, insurance fraud, unjust enrichment and other common law and statutory claims arising from defendants\u2019 manufacturing, distribution, marketing and promotion of opioids and seek restitution, damages, injunctive and other relief and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The claims generally are based on alleged misrepresentations and/or omissions in connection with the sale and marketing of prescription opioid medications and/or an alleged failure to take adequate steps to prevent abuse and diversion. While DSUVIA is designed for use solely in certified medically supervised healthcare settings and administered only by a healthcare professional in these settings, and is not distributed or available at retail pharmacies to patients by prescription, we can provide no assurance that parties will not file lawsuits of this type against us in the future. In addition, current public perceptions of the public health issue of opioid abuse may present challenges to favorable resolution of any potential claims. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether we may become subject to these kinds of investigations and lawsuits in the future, and if we were to be named as a defendant in such actions, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome. Any allegations against us may negatively affect our business in various ways, including through harm to our reputation.\nIf we were required to defend ourselves in these matters, we would likely incur significant legal costs and could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of fines, penalties, settlements or judgments. It is unlikely that our current product liability insurance would fully cover these potential liabilities, if at all. Moreover, we may be unable to maintain insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities or other losses. For more information about our product liability insurance and exclusions therefrom, please see the risk factor entitled \u201cWe face potential product liability claims, and, if such claims are successful, we may incur substantial liability\u201d elsewhere in this section. The resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, in the current climate, stories regarding prescription drug abuse and the diversion of opioids and other controlled substances are frequently in the media or advocated by public interest groups. Unfavorable publicity regarding the use or misuse of opioid drugs, the limitations of abuse-deterrent formulations, the ability of drug abusers to discover previously unknown ways to abuse opioid products, public inquiries and investigations into prescription drug abuse, litigation, or regulatory activity regarding sales, marketing, distribution or storage of opioids could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and impact on the results of litigation.\nFinally, various government entities, including Congress, state legislatures or other policy-making bodies, or public interest groups have in the past and may in the future hold hearings, conduct investigations and/or issue reports calling attention to the opioid crisis, and may mention or criticize the perceived role of manufacturers, including us, in the opioid crisis. Similarly, press organizations have and likely will continue to report on these issues, and such reporting may result in adverse publicity for us, resulting in reputational harm.\nA key part of our business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and fund development and approval of our products, particularly outside of the United States. We may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships, which may significantly limit our ability to develop and commercialize our products successfully, if at all.\nWe will need to establish and maintain successful collaborative relationships to obtain international sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our products. The process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult, time-consuming and involves significant uncertainty. For example:\n\u2022 our partners may seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us due to unsatisfactory clinical or regulatory results, manufacturing issues, a change in business strategy, a change of control or other reasons;\n\u2022 our contracts for collaborative arrangements are or may be terminable at will on written notice and may otherwise expire or terminate, and we may not have alternatives available to achieve the potential for our products in those territories or markets;\n\u2022 our partners may choose to pursue alternative technologies, including those of our competitors;\n\u2022 we may have disputes with a partner that could lead to litigation or arbitration, including in connection with any contractual force majeure notices tied to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022 we have limited control over the decisions of our partners, and they may change the priority of our programs in a manner that would result in termination of the agreement or add significant delays to the partnered program;\n\u2022 our ability to generate future payments and royalties from our partners depends upon the abilities of our partners to establish the safety and efficacy of our drugs, maintain regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully manufacture and achieve market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022 we or our partners may fail to properly initiate, maintain or defend our intellectual property rights, where applicable, or a party may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or potentially invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u2022 our partners may not devote sufficient capital or resources towards our products; and\n\u2022 our partners may not comply with applicable government regulatory requirements necessary to successfully market and sell our products.\nIf any collaborator fails to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner, or at all, any research, clinical development, manufacturing or commercialization efforts pursuant to that collaboration could be delayed or terminated, or it may be necessary for us to assume responsibility for expenses or activities that would otherwise have been the responsibility of our collaborator. For example, Gr\u00fcnenthal has terminated the collaboration agreement for the commercialization of Zalviso in Europe. The rights to market and sell Zalviso in the Territory revert back to us in May 2021. We have a continuing obligation, through the term of the Royalty Monetization with PDL, to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a replacement license agreement, or New Arrangement. On August 31, 2020, PDL announced it sold its royalty interest for Zalviso to SWK. If we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully and timely transition terminated collaborative agreements, including entering into a New Arrangement for Zalviso in Europe, we may have to undertake development and commercialization activities at our own expense or find alternative sources of capital.\nApproval of Zalviso and DZUVEO in Europe has resulted in a variety of risks associated with international operations that could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur collaboration with Gr\u00fcnenthal for Zalviso required us to supply product to support the European commercialization of Zalviso and it is possible that any New Arrangement would also include such a requirement. In addition, with the June 2018 approval of DZUVEO in Europe, we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market DZUVEO in Europe, which may also require us to supply product to those third parties. We may be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022 multiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations such as privacy and data regulations, transparency regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements, including for drug approvals, and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses;\n\u2022 EMA \u201csunset clause\u201d requirements, which apply to DZUVEO, providing that the marketing authorization of a medicine will cease to be valid if it is not placed on the market within three years of the authorization being granted (i.e., by June of 2021) or if it is removed from the market for three consecutive years; however, the European Commission has extended this date to March 1, 2022 for DZUVEO;\n\u2022 reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 different payer reimbursement regimes, governmental payers, patient self-pay systems and price controls;\n\u2022 economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022 production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022 business interruptions resulting from pandemics, geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we, or current and potential partners, are unable to compete effectively, our products may not reach their commercial potential.\nThe U.S. biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense competition and cost pressure. DSUVIA competes, and Zalviso, if approved in the U.S., will compete, with a number of existing and future pharmaceuticals and drug delivery devices developed, manufactured and marketed by others. In particular, DSUVIA may compete with a wide variety of products and product candidates including (i) injectable opioid products, such as morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone and meperidine; (ii) oral opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone; (iii) generic injectable local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine or branded formulations thereof; (iv) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, including ketorolac in intranasal or generic IV form, and IV meloxicam; and (v) transmucosal fentanyl products. Zalviso, if approved in the U.S., may compete with a number of opioid-based treatment options, including IV PCA pumps, oral PCA devices, and transdermal opioid PCAs.\nKey competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our approved products are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approval of products, and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors\u2019 drugs or drug delivery systems may be more effective, have fewer adverse effects, be less expensive to develop and manufacture, or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product we may seek to commercialize. This may render our products obsolete or non-competitive. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market, additional technologies become available, and competitors establish collaborative or licensing relationships, which may adversely affect our competitive position. These and other competitive risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations.\nHospital or other health care facility formulary approvals for DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States may not be achieved, or could be subject to certain restrictions, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products.\nObtaining hospital or other health care facility formulary approvals can be an expensive and time-consuming process. We cannot be certain if and when we will obtain formulary approvals to allow us to sell our products into our target markets. In particular, the restrictions on our commercial and medical affairs teams\u2019 access to hospitals and other health care facilities has adversely impacted the number of formulary approvals we anticipated achieving in 2020, and for as long as these restrictions remain in place, or new restrictions are implemented, we may have limited visibility or difficulties in obtaining these formulary approvals. Failure to obtain timely formulary approval will limit our commercial success. If we are successful in obtaining formulary approvals, we may need to complete evaluation programs whereby DSUVIA, or Zalviso, if approved, is used on a limited basis for certain patient types. The evaluation period may last several months and there can be no assurance that use during the evaluation period will lead to formulary approvals of DSUVIA, or Zalviso, if approved. Further, even successful formulary approvals may be subject to certain restrictions based on patient type or hospital protocol. Failure to obtain timely formulary approvals for DSUVIA, or Zalviso, if approved, would materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations.\nCoverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, or DZUVEO or Zalviso in Europe, which could make it difficult for us, or our partners, to sell our products profitably.\nOur ability to commercialize DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, and any future collaboration partner\u2019s ability to commercialize DZUVEO or Zalviso in Europe successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available from government payer programs at the federal and state levels, authorities, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, managed care plans and other third-party payers.\nNo uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers in the United States or Europe. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Our inability to promptly obtain and sufficiently maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from third party payers could significantly harm our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize our approved drugs and our overall financial condition.\nA primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the United States and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. These legislative and/or regulatory changes may negatively impact the reimbursement for our products, following approval. The availability of numerous generic pain medications may also substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, and DSUVIA/DZUVEO and Zalviso in Europe and elsewhere. The application of user fees to generic drug products may expedite the approval of additional pain medication generic drugs. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with our sales of DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, European sales of Zalviso, and future product sales of DZUVEO, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed.\nFurthermore, market acceptance and sales of our products will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers, hospitals and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, or DZUVEO or Zalviso in Europe. Also, reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. For example, we anticipate we may need comparator studies of DZUVEO in Europe to ensure premium reimbursement in certain countries. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, or DZUVEO or Zalviso in Europe.\nAdditionally, the regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues able to be generated from the sale of the product in that country. For example, separate pricing and reimbursement approvals may impact any future collaboration partners\u2019 ability to market and successfully commercialize our products in the 27 member states of the European Union. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in DSUVIA in the United States, or Zalviso, even after obtaining FDA marketing approval.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.\nIf we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses of our products, including DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, we may become subject to significant liability. Such enforcement has become more common in the industry. The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. While we have received marketing approval for DSUVIA for our proposed indication, physicians may nevertheless use our products for their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label, if the physicians personally believe in their professional medical judgment it could be used in such manner. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties and a requirement for corrective advertising, including Dear Doctor letters. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, increased losses and diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The FDA or other enforcement authorities could also request that we enter into a consent decree or a corporate integrity agreement or seek a permanent injunction against us under which specified promotional conduct is monitored, changed or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain relationships with group purchasing organizations any future revenues or future profitability could be jeopardized.\nMany end-users of pharmaceutical products have relationships with group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, whereby such GPOs provide such end-users access to a broad range of pharmaceutical products from multiple suppliers at competitive prices and, in certain cases, exercise considerable influence over the drug purchasing decisions of such end-users. Hospitals and other end-users contract with the GPO of their choice for their purchasing needs. We expect to derive revenue from end-user customers that are members of GPOs for DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved. Establishing and maintaining strong relationships with these GPOs will require us to be a reliable supplier, remain price competitive and comply with FDA regulations. The GPOs with whom we have relationships may have relationships with manufacturers that sell competing products, and such GPOs may earn higher margins from these products or combinations of competing products or may prefer products other than ours for other reasons. If we are unable to establish or maintain our GPO relationships, sales of DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, and related revenues could be negatively impacted.\nWe intend to rely on a limited number of distributors and pharmaceutical wholesalers to distribute DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, in the United States.\nWe intend to rely primarily upon distributors and pharmaceutical wholesalers in connection with the distribution of DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, in the United States. As part of the DSUVIA REMS program, we monitor distribution and audit wholesalers\u2019 data and will monitor such data from other distributors. If our distributors and wholesalers do not comply with the DSUVIA REMS requirements, or if we are unable to establish or maintain our business relationships with these distributors and pharmaceutical wholesalers on commercially acceptable terms, or if our distributors and wholesalers are unable to distribute our drugs for regulatory, compliance or any other reason, it could have a material adverse effect on our sales and may prevent us from achieving profitability.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval\nExisting and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our products and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve, including changes to the regulation of opioid-containing products. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding healthcare systems that could prevent or delay marketing approval of Zalviso outside of Europe. These changes will restrict or regulate post-approval activities for DSUVIA, DZUVEO and Zalviso, and affect our ability to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing approval. For example, in February 2016, the FDA announced a comprehensive action plan to take concrete steps towards reducing the impact of opioid abuse on American families and communities. As part of this plan, the FDA announced that it intended to review product and labeling decisions and re-examine the risk-benefit paradigm for opioids. In June 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance related to a new benefit/risk framework for new opioid analgesic products, which proposes that the new product candidate show some benefit over an existing product. In September 2019, the FDA held a public hearing to receive stakeholder input on the approval process for new opioids. In January 2020, FDA\u2019s Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee recommended against the approval of a new opioid analgesic, oxycodegol, the NDA for which was subsequently withdrawn by its sponsor. The timing of the resubmission of the Zalviso NDA is dependent upon the finalization of the FDA\u2019s new opioid approval guidelines and process.\nIn the European Union, or EU, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. The EU also provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. In addition, the EMA has a \u201csunset clause\u201d which provides that the marketing authorization of a medicine will cease to be valid if it is not placed on the market within three years of the authorization being granted or if it is removed from the market for three consecutive years; however, the European Commission has extended this date to March 1, 2022 for DZUVEO.\nIn the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act was enacted in an effort to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Aspects of the Affordable Care Act that may impact our business include:\n\u2022 extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022 expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022 expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance; and\n\u2022 a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nThe Affordable Care Act continues to substantially change health care financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, which may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nThere remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax, and effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. In December 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule, effective in 2020, permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended or repealed in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we or our collaborators are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or our collaborators are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our products may lose regulatory approval and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2030 unless Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030. The American Taxpayer Relief Act further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals.\nMoreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013 imposes additional obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product.\nIn the United States, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent \u201cprinciples\u201d for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Additionally, the Trump Administration previously released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals On November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which has also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. Further, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the U.S. District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, even after initial price and reimbursement approvals, reductions in prices and changes in reimbursement levels can be triggered by multiple factors, including reference pricing systems and publication of discounts by third party payers or authorities in other countries. In Europe, prices can be reduced further by parallel distribution and parallel trade, i.e. arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced countries. If any of these events occur, revenue from sales of Zalviso and DZUVEO in Europe would be negatively affected.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and further restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our products, if any, may be.\nWe expect that additional healthcare reform measures will be adopted within and outside the United States in the future, any of which could negatively impact our business. For instance, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payers of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect the demand for any drug products for which we have obtained or may obtain regulatory approval, our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products, our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product, our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability, and the level of taxes that we are required to pay.\nWe may experience market resistance, delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy regarding opioids generally, and sufentanil specifically.\nIn February 2016, the FDA announced a comprehensive action plan to take concrete steps towards reducing the impact of opioid abuse on American families and communities. As part of this plan, the FDA announced that it intended to review product and labeling decisions and re-examine the risk-benefit paradigm for opioids. In June 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance related to a new benefit/risk framework for new opioid analgesic products, which proposes that the new product candidate show some benefit over an existing product. In September 2019, the FDA held a public hearing to receive stakeholder input on the approval process for new opioids. The timing of the resubmission of the Zalviso NDA is dependent upon the finalization of the FDA\u2019s new opioid approval guidelines and process.\nIn May 2017, an Opioid Policy Steering Committee was established to address and advise regulators on opioid use. The Committee was charged with three initial questions: (i) should the FDA require mandatory education for healthcare professionals, or HCPs, who prescribe opioids; (ii) should the FDA take steps to ensure the number of prescribed opioid doses is more closely tailored to the medical indication; and (iii) is the FDA properly considering the risk of abuse and misuse of opioids during its drug review process. Zalviso has not been designed with an abuse-deterrent formulation and is not tamper-resistant. As a result, Zalviso has not undergone testing for tamper-resistance or abuse deterrence.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny marketing approval for many reasons, including:\n\u2022 a product candidate may not be considered safe or effective;\n\u2022 the manufacturing processes or facilities we have selected may not meet the applicable requirements; and,\n\u2022 changes in their approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional work on our part.\nPart of the regulatory approval process includes compliance inspections of manufacturing facilities to ensure adherence to applicable regulations and guidelines. The regulatory agency may delay, limit or deny marketing approval of our product candidate, Zalviso, as a result of such inspections. We, our contract manufacturers, and their vendors, are all subject to preapproval and post-approval inspections at any time. The results of these inspections could impact our ability to obtain FDA approval for Zalviso and, if approved, our ability to launch and successfully commercialize Zalviso in the United States. In addition, results of FDA inspections could impact our ability to maintain FDA approval of DSUVIA, and our ability to expand and sustain commercial sales of DSUVIA in the United States.\nAny delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, approval for Zalviso in the United States could prevent us from generating meaningful revenues or achieving profitability. Zalviso may not be approved even if we believe it has achieved its endpoints in clinical trials. Regulatory agencies, including the FDA, or their advisors, may disagree with our trial design and our interpretations of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Regulatory agencies may change requirements for approval even after a clinical trial design has been approved. The FDA exercises significant discretion over the regulation of combination products, including the discretion to require separate marketing applications for the drug and device components in a combination product. Zalviso is being regulated as a drug product under the NDA process administered by the FDA. The FDA could in the future require additional regulation of Zalviso, or DSUVIA, under the medical device provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. We must comply with the Quality Systems Regulation, or QSR, which sets forth the FDA\u2019s current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements for medical devices, and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards for drug cGMPs. If we fail to comply with these regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRegulatory agencies also may approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing trials. For example, DSUVIA is subject to a deferred post-marketing requirement for study in the pediatric population ages 6-17 years. As required in the DSUVIA FDA approval letter, a final protocol for this trial was submitted to the FDA in August 2020, in conjunction with a request to defer initiation of pediatric studies until additional post-market safety data is obtained in adult patients using DSUVIA. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. For example, we intend to seek approval of Zalviso for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adult patients in the hospital setting; however, our clinical trial data was generated exclusively from the post-operative segment of this population, and the FDA may restrict any approval to post-operative patients only, which would reduce the size of the commercial opportunity.\nThe success of Zalviso relies, in part, on obtaining regulatory approval in the United States.\nThe success of Zalviso relies, in part, upon our ability to develop and receive regulatory approval of this product candidate in the United States for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adult patients in the hospital setting. Our Phase 3 program for Zalviso initially consisted of three Phase 3 clinical trials. We reported positive top-line data from each of these trials and submitted an NDA for Zalviso to the FDA in September 2013, which the FDA then accepted for filing in December 2013. In July 2014, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, for our NDA for Zalviso, or the Zalviso CRL. The Zalviso CRL contained requests for additional information on the Zalviso System to ensure proper use of the device. The requests include submission of data demonstrating a reduction in the incidence of device errors, changes to address inadvertent dosing, among other items, and submission of additional data to support the shelf life of the product. Furthermore, in March 2015, we received correspondence from the FDA stating that in addition to the bench testing and two Human Factors studies we had performed in response to the issues identified in the Zalviso CRL, a clinical trial was needed to assess the risk of inadvertent dispensing and overall risk of dispensing failures. Based on the results of our Type C meeting with the FDA in September 2015, we completed the protocol review with the FDA and initiated this study, IAP312, in September 2016.\nIAP312 was a Phase 3 study in post-operative patients designed to evaluate the effectiveness of changes made to the functionality and usability of the Zalviso device and to take into account comments from the FDA on the study protocol. The IAP312 study was designed to rule out a 5% device failure rate. The study design required a minimum of 315 patients. In the IAP312 study, sites proactively looked for tablets that were dispensed by the patient but failed to be placed under the tongue, known as dropped tablets. The FDA refers to dropped tablets as inadvertent dispensing. Correspondence from the FDA suggests that they may include the rate of inadvertent dispensing along with the device failures to calculate a total error rate. The IAP312 study evaluated all incidents of misplaced tablets; however, per the protocol, the error rate calculation does not include the rate of inadvertent dispensing. If the FDA includes the rate of inadvertent dispensing along with the device failures to calculate a total error rate, the resulting error rate may be unacceptable to the FDA. Further, the correspondence from the FDA suggests that we may need to modify the REMS program for Zalviso to address dropped tablets. The IAP312 results will supplement the three Phase 3 trials already completed in the Zalviso NDA resubmission. The timing of the resubmission of the Zalviso NDA is dependent upon the finalization of the FDA\u2019s new opioid approval guidelines and process.\nThere is no guarantee that the additional work we performed related to Zalviso, including the IAP312 trial, will result in our successfully obtaining FDA approval of Zalviso in a timely fashion, if at all. Although we believe the IAP312 study met safety, satisfaction and device usability expectations, there is no guarantee the IAP312 trial results will address the issues raised by the FDA. For example, the FDA may include the rate of inadvertent dispensing along with the device failures to calculate a total error rate and the resulting error rate may be unacceptable to the FDA, or the FDA may still have concerns regarding the performance of the device, inadvertent dosing (dropped tablets), or other issues. At any future point in time, the FDA could require us to complete further clinical, Human Factors, pharmaceutical, reprocessing or other studies, which could delay or preclude any NDA resubmission or approval of the NDA and could require us to obtain significant additional funding. We may not be able to identify appropriate remediations to issues that the FDA may raise, and we may not have sufficient time or financial resources to conduct future activities to remediate issues raised by the FDA. We intend to seek a label indication for Zalviso for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adult patients in the hospital setting. However, our clinical trial data was generated exclusively from the post-operative segment of this population, and the FDA may restrict any approval to post-operative patients only, which would reduce our commercial opportunity.\nUpon resubmission of the Zalviso NDA, the FDA may hold an advisory committee meeting to obtain committee input on the safety and efficacy of Zalviso. Typically, advisory committees will provide responses to specific questions asked by the FDA, including the committee\u2019s view on the approvability of the drug under review. Advisory committee decisions are not binding, but an adverse decision at the advisory committee may have a negative impact on the regulatory review of Zalviso. Additionally, we may choose to engage in the dispute resolution process with the FDA.\nOur proposed trade name of Zalviso has been approved by the EMA and is currently being used in Europe. It has also been conditionally approved by the FDA, which must approve all drug trade names to avoid medication errors and misbranding. However, the FDA may withdraw this approval in which case any brand recognition or goodwill that we establish with the name Zalviso prior to commercialization may be worthless.\nAny delay in approval by the FDA of the Zalviso NDA, once it is resubmitted, may negatively impact our stock price and harm our business operations. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, regulatory approval would prevent us from commercializing Zalviso in the United States, generating revenues and potentially achieving profitability. If any of these events occur, we may be forced to delay or abandon our development efforts for Zalviso, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPositive clinical results obtained to date for Zalviso may be disputed in FDA review, do not guarantee regulatory approval and may not be obtained from future clinical trials.\nWe have reported positive top-line data from each of our four Zalviso Phase 3 clinical trials completed to date, as well as our Phase 2 clinical trials for Zalviso. However, even if we believe that the data obtained from clinical trials is positive, the FDA has, and in the future could, determine that the data from our trials was negative or inconclusive or could reach a different conclusion than we did on that same data. Negative or inconclusive results of a clinical trial or difference of opinion could cause the FDA to require us to repeat the trial or conduct additional clinical trials prior to obtaining approval for commercialization, and there is no guarantee that additional trials would achieve positive results or that the FDA will agree with our interpretation of the results. If the FDA were to require any additional clinical trials for Zalviso, our development efforts would be further delayed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Any such determination by the FDA would delay the timing of our commercialization plan for Zalviso and adversely affect our business operations.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales.\nWe have experienced and may in the future experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates. While we have completed four Phase 3 clinical trials and several Phase 2 clinical trials for Zalviso, future clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed on schedule, if at all. For example, we postponed the start of IAP312, originally planned for the first quarter of 2016, to September 2016. The postponement was due to a delay in the receipt and testing of final clinical supplies for this trial. As a result, the development timeline for Zalviso was further extended.\nOur post-approval clinical trials for DSUVIA, or any future FDA-required clinical trials for Zalviso, could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022 inability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u2022 delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022 delays in reaching agreement with the FDA on final trial design;\n\u2022 imposition of a clinical hold by the FDA, Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022 delays in obtaining required IRB approval at each site;\n\u2022 delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022 delays in the testing, validation, manufacture and delivery of the tablets and device components of DSUVIA or Zalviso;\n\u2022 delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022 clinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment or being delayed in entering data to allow for clinical trial database closure;\n\u2022 time required to add new clinical sites; or\n\u2022 delays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIf any future FDA-required clinical trials are delayed for any reason, our development costs may increase, our approval process for Zalviso could be delayed, our ability to commercialize and commence sales of Zalviso could be materially harmed, and our ability to maintain FDA approval of DSUVIA could be jeopardized, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nZalviso may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance. DSUVIA may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could limit market acceptance.\nAdverse events, or AEs, caused by Zalviso could cause us, other reviewing entities, clinical trial sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt any future FDA-required clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval. Phase 2 clinical trials we conducted with Zalviso did generate some AEs, but no significant adverse events, or SAEs, related to the trial drug. In our Phase 3 active-comparator clinical trial (IAP309), 8% of Zalviso-treated patients dropped out of the trial prematurely due to an AE (11% in the IV patient-controlled morphine group), and we observed three serious adverse events, or SAEs, that were assessed as possibly or probably related to study drug (one- respiratory depression in the Zalviso group and two- abdominal distension and ileus in the IV patient-controlled morphine group). In our Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, abdominal surgery trial (IAP310), 6% of Zalviso-treated patients dropped out of the trial prematurely due to an AE (9% in placebo group). There were no SAEs determined to be related to study drug. In our Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, orthopedic surgery trial (IAP311), 7% of Zalviso-treated patients dropped out of the trial prematurely due to an AE (7% in placebo group). Four patients (three in the Zalviso group and one in the placebo group) experienced an SAE considered possibly or probably related to the trial drug by the investigator. The SAEs possibly or probably attributed to Zalviso were severe oxygen saturation decrease, sinus tachycardia and confusional state. In our Phase 3 multicenter, open-label study of Zalviso (IAP312), 3% of patients dropped out prematurely due to an AE. Five patients experienced SAEs in the IAP312 study and none of these were considered possibly or probably related to the study drug by the investigator.\nIn our Phase 2 DSUVIA placebo-controlled bunionectomy study (SAP202), two patients in the DSUVIA 30 mcg group (5%) discontinued treatment due to an AE, one unrelated to study drug and the other probably related to study drug. There were no SAEs deemed related to study drug. In our Phase 3 placebo-controlled abdominal surgery study (SAP301), one DSUVIA-treated patient (1%) dropped out of the trial prematurely due to an AE (4% in placebo group). There were two SAEs determined to be related to study drug in the placebo-treated group and no related SAEs in the DSUVIA group. In our Phase 3 open-label, single-arm emergency room study (SAP302), no DSUVIA-treated patients dropped out of the trial prematurely due to an AE. One patient had an SAE - angina pectoris - possibly related to study drug. In our post-operative study in patients aged 40 years or older (SAP303), 3% of DSUVIA-treated patients dropped out of the trial prematurely due to an AE. There were no SAEs deemed related to study drug.\nIf DSUVIA or, if approved, Zalviso cause serious or unexpected side effects after receiving marketing approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified REMS program;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u2022 we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u2022 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; or,\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of DSUVIA or, if approved, Zalviso, and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our products.\nAdditional time may be required to obtain U.S. regulatory approval for Zalviso because it is a drug/device combination product candidate.\nDSUVIA and Zalviso are combination products with both drug and device components. The FDA requires both the drug and device components of combination product candidates to be reviewed as part of an NDA submission. There are very few examples of the FDA approval process for drug/device combination products such as DSUVIA and Zalviso. As a result, we experienced delays in the development and commercialization of DSUVIA, and may experience future delays in the development and commercialization of Zalviso, due to regulatory uncertainties in the product development and approval process, in particular as it relates to a drug/device combination product approval under an NDA.\nThe process for obtaining approval of an NDA is time consuming, subject to unanticipated delays and costs, and requires the commitment of substantial resources.\nIf the FDA determines that any of the clinical work submitted, including the clinical trials, Human Factors studies and bench testing submitted for a product candidate in support of an NDA were not conducted in full compliance with the applicable protocols for these trials, studies and testing as well as with applicable regulations and standards, or if the FDA does not agree with our interpretation of the results of such trials, studies and testing, the FDA may reject the data and results. The FDA may audit some or all of our clinical trial sites to determine the integrity of our clinical data. The FDA may audit some or all of our Human Factors study sites to determine the integrity of our data and may audit the data and results of bench testing. Any rejection of any of our data would negatively impact our ability to obtain marketing authorization for our product candidate, Zalviso, and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, an NDA may not be approved, or approval may be delayed, as a result of changes in FDA policies for drug approval during the review period. For example, although many products have been approved by the FDA in recent years under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, objections have been raised to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If challenges to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b) (2) are successful, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation, which could delay or prevent the approval of such an NDA. More generally, the FDA\u2019s comprehensive action plan to take concrete steps towards reducing the impact of opioid abuse on American families and communities may result in delays and challenges in obtaining NDA approval. Any significant delay in the acceptance, review or approval of an NDA that we have submitted would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and would require us to obtain significant additional funding.\nAlthough we have obtained regulatory approval for DSUVIA, and even if we obtain regulatory approval for Zalviso in the United States, we and our collaborators face extensive regulatory requirements, and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nAlthough we have obtained regulatory approval for DSUVIA, and even if we obtain regulatory approval for Zalviso in the United States, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our products or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval trials or post-market surveillance. For example, DSUVIA is subject to a deferred post-marketing requirement for study in the pediatric population ages 6-17 years. A final protocol for this trial was submitted to the FDA in August 2020, in conjunction with a request to defer initiation of pediatric studies until additional post-market safety data is obtained in adult patients using DSUVIA. Additionally, the labeling approved for DSUVIA includes restrictions on use due to the opioid nature of sufentanil. If approved, the labeling for Zalviso will likely include similar restrictions on use.\nDSUVIA in the United States is also subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report AEs and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process.\nAdvertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules concerning the advertising and promotion of DSUVIA and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in the receipt of warning letters and further liability if off-label promotion is involved. For example, on February 11, 2021, we received a warning letter from the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, or OPDP, of the FDA relating to a banner advertisement we submitted to the OPDP on December 6, 2019 and a tabletop display we submitted on February 28, 2020, and resubmitted to the OPDP at its request on September 23, 2020. We submitted the materials to the OPDP pursuant to the FDA requirement that sponsors submit all promotional materials to the FDA at the time of their initial dissemination or publication. The FDA\u2019s concerns identified in the letter include its view that the promotional material makes misleading claims and representations about the risks and efficacy of DSUVIA because the material does not reveal facts that are material in light of the representations made. As a result, we conducted a review of our marketing materials to identify any potential revisions in light of the letter. We responded to the FDA within the timeframe requested in the letter and sought guidance and clarification from the FDA on the concerns raised in the letter. We cannot give any assurances, however, that the FDA will be satisfied with our response to the letter or that such response will resolve the issues identified in the letter. If approved, Zalviso will be subject to these same requirements.\nWe must also register and obtain various state prescription drug distribution licenses and controlled substance permits, and any delay or failure to obtain or maintain these licenses or permits may limit our market and materially impact our business. In certain states we cannot apply for a license until a drug is approved by the FDA. The state licensing process may take several months which would delay commercialization in those states. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMPs and adherence to commitments made in the NDA. If we, or a regulatory agency, discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facilities, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of our products, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022 issue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022 seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022 suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022 suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022 refuse to approve a pending NDA or supplements to an NDA submitted by us;\n\u2022 seize product; or\n\u2022 refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize DSUVIA, or, if approved, Zalviso, and generate revenues.\nExcept for Zalviso and DZUVEO, which are both approved in Europe, we may never obtain additional regulatory approvals for our products and product candidates outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to market any products outside of the United States, we or our commercial partners, must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. On September 22, 2015, we announced that the EC had granted marketing approval for Gr\u00fcnenthal\u2019s MAA for Zalviso for the management of acute moderate-to-severe post-operative pain in adult patients. In April 2016, Gr\u00fcnenthal completed the first commercial sale of Zalviso. Gr\u00fcnenthal terminated the collaboration, effective November 13, 2020. The terms of the Gr\u00fcnenthal Agreements were extended to May 2021 to enable Gr\u00fcnenthal to sell down its Zalviso inventory, a right it had under the Gr\u00fcnenthal Agreements. The rights to market and sell Zalviso in the Territory revert back to us in May 2021. We have not yet negotiated a New Arrangement and there can be no assurance that we will successfully enter into a New Arrangement. In June 2018, we announced that the EC had granted marketing approval of DZUVEO for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically monitored settings. We have not yet entered into a collaboration agreement with a strategic partner for the commercialization of DZUVEO in Europe and there can be no assurance that we will successfully enter into such an agreement.\nPart of the foreign regulatory approval process includes compliance inspections of manufacturing facilities to ensure adherence to applicable regulations and guidelines. The foreign regulatory agency may delay, limit or deny marketing approval as a result of such inspections. We, our contract manufacturers, and their vendors, are all subject to preapproval and post-approval inspections at any time. The results of these inspections could impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval of DSUVIA and Zalviso in countries outside of the United States and Europe, or our ability to launch and successfully commercialize these products, once approved. In addition, results of EMA inspections could impact our ability to maintain EC approval of Zalviso and DZUVEO, and any future collaboration partner\u2019s ability to expand and sustain commercial sales of Zalviso or DZUVEO in Europe.\nOutside of Europe, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional non-clinical trials or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country-to-country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. Our current clinical trial data may not be sufficient to support marketing approval or premium reimbursement in all territories. For example, we anticipate we may need comparator studies for DZUVEO in Europe to ensure premium reimbursement in certain countries. While we have obtained approval of DZUVEO in Europe, even if we are successful in entering into a collaboration agreement with a commercial partner, we will be substantially dependent on that commercial partner to comply with regulatory requirements. If we, or our commercial partners, fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed.\nDSUVIA requires, and, if approved, Zalviso will require, a REMS program.\nDSUVIA was approved in the United States with a REMS program. If Zalviso is approved in the United States, it will also require a REMS program. The DSUVIA REMS program includes restrictions on product distribution and use only in certified medically supervised settings. Before DSUVIA is distributed, an authorized representative from each medically supervised setting must sign an attestation that they have the ability to manage acute opioid overdose and will train all relevant staff on administration of DSUVIA, including the importance of only dispensing the product in a medically supervised setting. Therefore, REMS-certification is a key gating item to generating product revenues for DSUVIA. In addition, the REMS program for DSUVIA may significantly increase our costs to commercialize this product. While we have received pre-clearance from the FDA regarding certain aspects of the proposed required REMS program for Zalviso, we cannot predict the final REMS program to be required as part of any FDA approval of Zalviso. Depending on the extent of the REMS requirements, any U.S. launch may be delayed, the costs to commercialize Zalviso may increase substantially and the potential commercial market could be restricted. Furthermore, risks of sufentanil that are not adequately addressed through the proposed REMS program for Zalviso may also prevent or delay its approval for commercialization.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception, anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses in 2021 and may continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception in July 2005, and as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $438.5 million.\nWe have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our non-clinical development activities and clinical trials. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities, borrowings, payments from our commercial partner, Gr\u00fcnenthal, monetization of certain future royalties and commercial sales milestones from the European sales of Zalviso by Gr\u00fcnenthal, funding from the Department of Defense, or DoD, and more recently with revenues from sales of DSUVIA since the commercial launch in the first quarter of 2019. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenues. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses as we support commercialization activities for DSUVIA and conduct research and development activities, including the FDA regulatory review of the Zalviso NDA, once resubmitted. Gr\u00fcnenthal\u2019s sales of Zalviso in Europe have historically been small. If DSUVIA is not successfully commercialized in the U.S., or if Zalviso is not successfully developed or commercialized in the U.S., or if revenues are insufficient following marketing approval, we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail. Our success is also dependent on current and future collaborations to market our products outside of the United States, which may not materialize or prove to be successful.\nWe have not yet generated significant product revenue and may never be profitable.\nOur ability to generate revenue from commercial sales and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaborators, to successfully complete the development of, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for, and commercialize our products. Although we received FDA approval of DSUVIA and began the commercial launch of DSUVIA in the United States, we may never generate enough revenues from sales of DSUVIA, or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States to become profitable. Although the EC granted marketing approval of DZUVEO in June 2018, we have not yet entered into a collaboration agreement with a strategic partner to commercialize DZUVEO in Europe and there can be no assurance that we will successfully enter into such an agreement. While we had a collaboration agreement with Gr\u00fcnenthal for commercialization of Zalviso in Europe and Australia it has been terminated, and Gr\u00fcnenthal was unable to achieve a level of commercial sales of Zalviso for which we were able to receive sales milestone payments. The rights to market and sell Zalviso in the Territory revert back to us in May 2021.\nIn September 2015, we consummated a monetization transaction with PDL pursuant to which we sold to PDL for $65.0 million 75% of the European royalties from sales of Zalviso and 80% of the first four commercial milestones under the Amended License Agreement, subject to a capped amount, referred to as the Royalty Monetization. On August 31, 2020, PDL announced it sold its royalty interest for Zalviso to SWK. As mentioned above, Gr\u00fcnenthal has terminated the Amended License Agreement and the rights will revert back to us in May 2021. Per the terms of the Royalty Monetization, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a replacement license agreement. Accordingly, even if we are able to enter into a replacement license agreement, and that licensee is successful in commercializing Zalviso in Europe, we will receive only a portion of any royalties until the capped amount owing under the Royalty Monetization is reached. We do not anticipate generating significant near-term revenues from DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:\n\u2022 maintaining regulatory approval for DSUVIA and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for Zalviso in the United States; and\n\u2022 launching and commercializing DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, in the United States by building, internally or through collaborations, an institutionally focused sales force, and launching and commercializing DZUVEO and Zalviso internationally by entering into collaborations, which may require additional funding.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with launching a commercial pharmaceutical product, pharmaceutical product development and the regulatory environment, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are delayed in receiving regulatory approval for Zalviso in the United States, or if we are required by the FDA to complete activities in addition to those we currently anticipate or have already completed.\nWe anticipate continuing to incur significant costs associated with commercializing DSUVIA in the United States. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, in the United States, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nFuture sales of DSUVIA to the DoD are not predictable, may occur on an irregular basis and may not meet our expectations due to various U.S. government-related factors that are beyond our control and into which we have little to no visibility, including the timing and extent of future U.S. military deployments. If DoD spending on DSUVIA does not meet our expectations, it could adversely affect our expected results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn April 2020, DSUVIA achieved Milestone C approval by the DoD, a decision that clears the path for the DoD to begin placing orders for DSUVIA. In September 2020, we announced that DSUVIA was added to the DoD Joint Deployment Formulary, a core list of pharmaceutical products that are designated for deploying military units across all service branches. Future sales of DSUVIA to the DoD are not predictable, may occur on an irregular basis, and may not meet our expectations due to various U.S. government-related factors that are beyond our control and into which we have little to no visibility, including the timing and extent of future U.S. military deployments. Even if we do generate revenue from such sales, we may never generate revenue that is significant or predictable, which could impair our value and our ability to raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations. The placement of new orders by the DoD is, among other things, contingent upon overall U.S. government policies, budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, deployment of military units, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling. Our expectations about the timing and size of initial stocking orders for U.S. Army sets, kits and outfits, or SKOs, and other orders by the DoD are based on our understanding of troop deployment schedules. If DoD spending on DSUVIA does not meet our expectations, this could have a material adverse effect on our expected results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe have been substantially dependent on our commercial partner, Gr\u00fcnenthal, to successfully commercialize Zalviso in Europe and they have terminated their collaboration agreement with us.\nUnder our agreements with Gr\u00fcnenthal, we granted Gr\u00fcnenthal rights to commercialize Zalviso in the Territory for human use in pain treatment within, or dispensed by, hospitals, hospices, nursing homes and other medically supervised settings. In September 2015, the EC granted marketing approval for Gr\u00fcnenthal\u2019s MAA for Zalviso for the management of acute moderate-to-severe post-operative pain in adult patients, and Gr\u00fcnenthal began its European launch of Zalviso with the first commercial sale occurring in April 2016. Gr\u00fcnenthal terminated the collaboration, effective November 13, 2020. The terms of the Gr\u00fcnenthal Agreements were extended to May 2021 to enable Gr\u00fcnenthal to sell down its Zalviso inventory, a right it had under the Gr\u00fcnenthal Agreements. The rights to market and sell Zalviso in the Territory revert back to us in May 2021.\nDuring the pilot and launch phases in the various European countries, Gr\u00fcnenthal reported certain issues from HCPs with the initial set up of the Zalviso controllers before being given to patients for use. To address the issues, we have assisted Gr\u00fcnenthal with implementing additional training for HCPs and we have revised the controller software. Controllers with the revised software, which were delivered in December 2016, have undergone extensive bench testing and we believe we have successfully addressed the issues as presented. Additional devices were delivered beginning in early 2017. Controllers with the U.S. version of the revised software were also used in the IAP312 clinical study that was initiated in September 2016. There can be no assurance that the issues identified in the initial pilot and launch phases by Gr\u00fcnenthal will not have a material adverse impact on the current and future sales of Zalviso in Europe. Further, if new issues occur, there may be a material adverse impact on the future sales of Zalviso in Europe which may have a negative impact on future revenues received and recognized by us.\nWe have not realized the expected benefits from our collaboration with Gr\u00fcnenthal, and may not realize the expected benefits from any New Arrangement, due to a number of important factors, including:\n\u2022 The timing and amount of any payments we may receive under our agreements will depend on, among other things, the efforts, allocation of resources, and successful commercialization of Zalviso by Gr\u00fcnenthal and any future collaboration partner in Europe;\n\u2022 Gr\u00fcnenthal changed the focus of its commercialization efforts to pursue higher-priority programs and any future collaboration partner may do the same;\n\u2022 Gr\u00fcnenthal will stop its commercialization efforts in countries where it currently has the sole right to commercialize Zalviso requiring us to find another collaboration partner for Zalviso in Europe; and\n\u2022 Gr\u00fcnenthal has terminated its agreements with us, and any future collaboration partner may also terminate any future agreement with us, adversely affecting our potential revenue from Zalviso;\nAny failures in commercialization of Zalviso outside the United States could have a material adverse impact on our business, including an adverse impact on the commercialization of DSUVIA or the development of Zalviso in the United States, if related to issues underlying the sufentanil sublingual tablet technology, safety or efficacy. Additionally, we agreed to certain representations and covenants relating to the Amended Agreements under our agreements with PDL, and, if we breach those representations or covenants, we may become subject to indemnification claims by PDL and liable to PDL for its indemnifiable losses relating to such breaches. The amount of such losses could be material and could have a material adverse impact on our business. On August 31, 2020, PDL announced it sold its royalty interest for Zalviso to SWK.\nWe have not yet entered into a collaboration agreement with a strategic partner for the commercialization of DZUVEO in Europe.\nIn June 2018, the EC granted marketing approval for DZUVEO but we have not yet entered into a collaboration agreement with a strategic partner to commercialize DZUVEO in Europe. If we are unable to enter into such an agreement, we may never generate revenues from sales of DZUVEO. If we are successful in identifying a commercial partner and entering into a collaboration agreement, we will be substantially dependent on this partner to successfully commercialize DZUVEO in Europe. Any failures in the commercialization of DZUVEO in Europe could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and operating results.\nAny future collaboration agreement for DZUVEO will likely require us to support the manufacturing and supply of the product in Europe for our commercial partner. In addition, we anticipate we may need comparator studies in Europe to ensure premium reimbursement in certain countries. Our inability to profitably manufacture and supply DZUVEO to any future commercial partner, or to successfully complete these additional comparator studies and obtain premium reimbursement in certain countries, may prevent, limit or delay commercialization and any associated future revenues from DZUVEO in Europe.\nWe have limited experience commercializing DSUVIA, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance or evaluate our business and prospects.\nSince inception, our operations have been primarily focused on developing our technology and undertaking pharmaceutical development and clinical trials for DSUVIA and Zalviso, understanding the market potential for DSUVIA and Zalviso, and preparing for the commercialization of DSUVIA and the potential commercialization of Zalviso in the United States. We launched commercialization efforts for DSUVIA in February 2019. As a result of our limited commercialization experience, any predictions that are made about our future performance, or viability, or evaluation of our business and prospects, may not be accurate.\nWe will require additional capital and may be unable to raise capital, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our commercialization efforts and product development programs and could cause us to cease operations.\nLaunch of a commercial pharmaceutical product and pharmaceutical development activities can be time consuming and costly. We expect to incur significant expenditures in connection with our ongoing activities including the commercial launch of DSUVIA in the United States and support for FDA regulatory review of the Zalviso NDA, once resubmitted. While we believe we have sufficient capital resources to continue planned operations for at least the next twelve months, we will need additional capital to pursue full commercialization of DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved.\nClinical trials, regulatory reviews, and the launch of commercial product are expensive activities. In addition, commercialization costs for DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, in the United States may be significantly higher than estimated as a result of technical difficulties or otherwise. Revenues may be lower than expected and costs to produce such revenues may exceed those revenues. We will need to seek additional capital to continue operations. Such capital demands could be substantial. In the future, we may seek to sell additional equity securities, including under the Sales Agreement with Cantor, and debt securities, monetize or securitize certain assets including future royalty streams and milestones, refinance our loan agreement, obtain a revolving credit facility, enter into product development, license or distribution agreements with third parties, or divest DSUVIA, DZUVEO or Zalviso. Such arrangements may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nFuture events and circumstances, including those beyond our control, may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. Furthermore, any product development, licensing, distribution or sale agreements that we enter into may require us to relinquish valuable rights. We may not be able to obtain sufficient additional funding or enter into a strategic transaction in a timely manner. If adequate funds are not available, we would be required to reduce our workforce, reduce the scope of, or cease, the commercial launch of DSUVIA, or the development of Zalviso in advance of the date on which we exhaust our cash resources to ensure that we have sufficient capital to meet our obligations and continue on a path designed to preserve stockholder value.\nSecuring additional financing may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize DSUVIA or develop Zalviso. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u2022 significantly scale back or discontinue the commercialization of DSUVIA, or the development of Zalviso;\n\u2022 seek additional corporate partners for Zalviso on terms that might be less favorable than might otherwise be available;\n\u2022 seek corporate partners for DSUVIA/DZUVEO on terms that might be less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u2022 relinquish, or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or products that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nTo fund our operations, we may sell additional equity securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or debt securities, which may impose restrictions on our business.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. In order to raise additional funds to support our operations, we may sell additional equity securities, including under the Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, or the ATM Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, as agent. We may sell common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. Selling additional equity securities may result in dilution to our existing stockholders and new investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Incurring additional indebtedness, including through the sale of debt securities, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions, such as minimum cash balances, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Sales of equity or debt securities may also provide new investors with rights superior to our existing stockholders. If we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations.\nIn addition, worsening economic conditions and other adverse effects or developments relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect the market price of our stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The market price for our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile, particularly due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market, industry and other factors. If additional funding is not available on favorable terms, if at all, due to these factors, we may not be able to obtain sufficient additional funding to support our operations.\nThe terms of our loan agreement with Oxford may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in business or to take certain actions, including to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOn May 30, 2019, we entered into the Loan Agreement with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, a Delaware limited liability company, as the Lender. The Loan Agreement contains, and any future indebtedness we incur will likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests. The Loan Agreement includes covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to (i) declare dividends or redeem or repurchase equity interests; (ii) incur additional liens; (iii) make loans and investments; (iv) incur additional indebtedness; (v) engage in mergers, acquisitions, and asset sales; (vi) transact with affiliates; (vii) undergo a change in control; (viii) add or change business locations; and (ix) engage in businesses that are not related to our existing business. The Loan Agreement also requires that we at all times maintain unrestricted cash of not less than $5.0 million.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Loan Agreement. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5% may be applied to the outstanding loan balances and all outstanding obligations under the Loan Agreement can be declared to be immediately due and payable If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness. The restrictions and covenants in the Loan Agreement and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.\nWe might be unable to service our existing debt due to a lack of cash flow and might be subject to default.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $21.0 million of accrued debt under the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement has a scheduled maturity date of June 1, 2023 and is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, with the exception of our intellectual property and those assets sold under the Royalty Monetization, where the security interest is limited to proceeds of intellectual property if it is licensed or sold.\nIf we do not make the required payments when due, either at maturity, or at applicable installment payment dates, or if we breach the agreement or become insolvent, the Lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and other payments, to be immediately due and payable. Additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Even if we were able to repay the full amount in cash, any such repayment could leave us with little or no working capital for our business. If we are unable to repay those amounts, the Lender will have a first claim on our assets pledged under the Loan Agreement. If the lender should attempt to foreclose on the collateral, it is unlikely that there would be any assets remaining after repayment in full of such secured indebtedness. Any default under the Loan Agreement and resulting foreclosure would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to continue our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third party manufacturers to produce commercial supplies of DSUVIA in the United States, commercial supplies of Zalviso in Europe, and clinical supplies of Zalviso in the United States. The failure of third party manufacturers to provide us with adequate commercial and clinical supplies could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nThird party manufacturers produce commercial and clinical supplies of our products and product candidates. Reliance on third party manufacturers entails many risks including:\n\u2022 the inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;\n\u2022 a delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022 manufacturing and product quality issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u2022 costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;\n\u2022 a failure to maintain in good order our production and manufacturing equipment for our products;\n\u2022 a failure to comply with cGMP and similar foreign standards;\n\u2022 the inability to negotiate manufacturing or supply agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022 termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing or supply agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u2022 the reliance on a limited number of sources, and in some cases, single sources for product components, such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these product components, we will be unable to manufacture and sell our products in a timely fashion, in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms;\n\u2022 the lack of qualified backup suppliers for those components that are currently purchased from a sole or single source supplier;\n\u2022 operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier, or government orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022 carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control; and\n\u2022 the failure to deliver our products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner.\nAny of these events could lead to stock outs, inability to successfully commercialize our products, clinical trial delays, or failure to obtain regulatory approval. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA action, including injunction, recall, seizure, or total or partial suspension of production.\nIn addition, we have not yet entered into a collaboration agreement for the sale of DZUVEO in Europe, but we anticipate that any future collaboration agreement will likely require us to manufacture and supply DZUVEO to our commercial partner. As mentioned above, we were obligated to manufacture and supply Zalviso under the Amended Agreements with Gr\u00fcnenthal for use in Europe and their other licensed territories and may be required to do so under any New Arrangement. If we are unable to establish a reliable commercial supply of Zalviso for Europe, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations under any New Arrangement in a timely manner or at all, and we may, as a result, be in breach of any New Arrangement. If any such breach, or other breach, were to be material and remain uncured, it could result in termination of the New Arrangement, which in turn could result in us being responsible for indemnification of losses suffered by PDL under the Royalty Monetization. If any of these events were to occur, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on limited sources of supply for the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of DSUVIA and Zalviso and any disruption in the chain of supply may cause a delay in supplying DSUVIA and Zalviso.\nCurrently we only have one supplier qualified as a vendor for the manufacture of DSUVIA, known as DZUVEO in Europe, and Zalviso with the FDA and EMA, respectively. If supply from the approved vendor is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. For example, our API provider for DSUVIA is changing its process for manufacturing our drug, which could impact our commercial supply of API for DSUVIA. This change in process requires a regulatory submission to the FDA. The European Health Authority has approved the change in process for both DZUVEO and Zalviso in the EU. In the U.S., a regulatory submission has been submitted to support the use of the API made with the new manufacturing process, but there is no guarantee that the FDA will approve the submission. For example, in July 2019, we received notice from the FDA that a deficiency in the API manufacturer\u2019s drug master file, or DMF, will need to be addressed before the submission can be approved. The API manufacturer responded to the FDA\u2019s DMF deficiency notice for the new manufacturing process and we resubmitted the Supplemental NDA seeking approval of use of the new manufacturing process API. Any alternate vendor would need to be qualified through an NDA supplement and/or an MAA variation which could result in delays. The FDA or other regulatory agencies outside of the United States may also require additional trials if a new sufentanil supplier is relied upon for commercial production.\nManufacture of sufentanil sublingual tablets requires specialized equipment and expertise.\nEthanol, which is used in the manufacturing process for our sufentanil sublingual tablets, is flammable, and sufentanil is a highly potent, Schedule II controlled substance. These factors necessitate the use of specialized equipment and facilities for manufacture of sufentanil sublingual tablets. There are a limited number of facilities that can accommodate our manufacturing process and we need to use dedicated equipment throughout development and commercial manufacturing to avoid the possibility of cross-contamination. If our equipment breaks down or needs to be repaired or replaced, it may cause significant disruption in clinical or commercial supply, which could result in delay in the process of obtaining approval for or sale of our products. Furthermore, we are using one manufacturer to produce our sufentanil sublingual tablets. Any problems with our existing facility or equipment, including ongoing expansion, may impair our ability to successfully commercialize DSUVIA or Zalviso, if approved, complete our clinical trials and increase our cost.\nManufacturing issues may arise that could delay or increase costs related to commercialization, product development and regulatory approval.\nWe have relied, and will continue to rely, on contract manufacturers, component fabricators and third-party service providers to produce the necessary DSUVIA single-dose applicator, or SDA, and Zalviso devices for the commercial marketplace. We currently outsource manufacturing and packaging of the DSUVIA SDA and the controller, dispenser and cartridge components of the Zalviso device to third parties and intend to continue to do so. Some of these component purchases were made and will continue to be made utilizing short-term purchase agreements and we may not be able to enter into long-term agreements for commercial supply of DSUVIA, DZUVEO or Zalviso devices with each of the third-party manufacturers or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. In addition, we have encountered and may continue to encounter production issues with our current or future contract manufacturers and other third party service providers, including the reliability of the production equipment, quality of the components produced, their inability to meet demand or other unanticipated delays including scale-up and automating processes, which could adversely impact our ability to supply our customers with DSUVIA, Zalviso and DZUVEO in Europe, and, if approved, Zalviso in the U.S. and any other foreign territories.\nAs we scale up manufacturing of DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, and conduct required stability testing, product, packaging, equipment and process-related issues may require refinement or resolution. For example, as we scale up, we may identify significant issues which could result in failure to maintain regulatory approval of DSUVIA, increased scrutiny by regulatory agencies, delays in clinical program and regulatory approval, increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain approval for Zalviso in the United States.\nWe have built out a suite within our CMO\u2019s production facility in Cincinnati, Ohio that serves as a manufacturing facility for clinical and commercial supplies of sufentanil sublingual tablets. Late stage development and manufacture of registration stability lots, which were utilized in clinical trials, were manufactured at this location. While we produced a number of commercial lots to support Gr\u00fcnenthal\u2019s launch in Europe, our experience is limited, which impacted our ability to deliver commercial supplies to Gr\u00fcnenthal on a timely basis, and may in the future impact our ability to deliver commercial supplies under any New Arrangement, if required, on a timely basis.\nIn January 2013, we entered into an agreement with a CMO to manufacture, supply, and provide certain validation and stability services with respect to Zalviso for potential sales in the United States, Canada, Mexico and other countries, subject to agreement by the parties to any additional fees for such other countries. On August 22, 2017, we entered into an amendment to this agreement to manufacture, supply, and provide certain validation and stability services with respect to DSUVIA for sales in the United States, and potential sales in Canada and Mexico, and other countries. There is no guarantee that our CMO\u2019s services will be satisfactory or that they will continue to meet the strict regulatory guidelines of the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies. If our CMO cannot provide us with an adequate supply of sufentanil sublingual tablets, we may be required to pursue alternative sources of manufacturing capacity. Switching or adding commercial manufacturing capability can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus, as well as additional regulatory filings which may result in significant delays. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new manufacturing facility commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired commercial timelines, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our ability to generate revenue.\nThe facilities of any of our future manufacturers of sufentanil-containing sublingual tablets must be approved by the FDA or the relevant foreign regulatory agency, such as the EMA, before commercial distribution from such manufacturers occurs. We do not fully control the manufacturing process of sufentanil sublingual tablets and are completely dependent on these third-party manufacturing partners for compliance with the FDA or other foreign regulatory agency\u2019s requirements for manufacture. In addition, although our third-party manufacturers are well-established commercial manufacturers, we are dependent on their continued adherence to cGMP manufacturing and acceptable changes to their process. If our manufacturers do not meet the FDA or other foreign regulatory agency\u2019s strict regulatory requirements, they will not be able to secure FDA or other foreign regulatory agency approval for their manufacturing facilities. Although European inspectors have approved our tablet manufacturing site, our third-party manufacturing partner is responsible for maintaining compliance with the relevant foreign regulatory agency\u2019s requirements. If the FDA or the relevant foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the commercial manufacture of sufentanil sublingual tablets, we will need to find alternative suppliers, which would result in significant delays in obtaining FDA approval for Zalviso, and other foreign regulatory agency approval of DSUVIA/DZUVEO and Zalviso outside Europe. These challenges may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may not be able to establish additional sources of supply for sufentanil-containing sublingual tablets or device manufacture. Such suppliers are subject to FDA and other foreign regulatory agency\u2019s regulations requiring that materials be produced under cGMPs or Quality System Regulations, or QSR, or in ISO 13485 accredited manufacturers, and subject to ongoing inspections by regulatory agencies. Failure by any of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations may result in delays and interruptions to our product supply while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements. In addition, if we are unable to establish a reliable commercial supply of Zalviso for Europe, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations under any New Arrangement, if required, in a timely manner or at all, and we may, as a result, be in breach of any New Arrangement.\nFor DSUVIA, we currently package the finished goods under a manual process and would package finished goods of DZUVEO in the same manner. The capacity and cost to package the finished goods under this manual process is not optimal to support successful future sales of DSUVIA and DZUVEO. We have initiated the process to purchase an automated filling and packaging line to support increased capacity packaging for DSUVIA and DZUVEO. Despite the delays due to the impact of COVID-19, we are projecting to complete the acquisition and installation of this line in the first half of 2021. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully purchase, install or validate the automated filling and packaging line for DSUVIA and DZUVEO. If we are successful in the purchase, installation and validation of this equipment and process, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to manufacture product on this line.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\nWe utilized contract research organizations, or CROs, for the conduct of the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of DSUVIA, as well as our Phase 3 clinical program for Zalviso. We rely on CROs, as well as clinical trial sites, to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and document preparation. While we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. We have relied and plan to continue to rely upon CROs to monitor and manage data for our post-approval clinical programs for DSUVIA and any FDA-required clinical programs for Zalviso, as well as the execution of nonclinical and clinical trials. We control only certain aspects of our CROs\u2019 activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWe, and our CROs, are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all product candidates in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical trials do not comply with cGCPs. Accordingly, if our CROs or clinical trial sites fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory process.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials, or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position. We face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by CROs, which may allow our potential competitors to access our proprietary technology. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize Zalviso. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for Zalviso, if approved, would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nFailure to receive required quotas of controlled substances or comply with the Drug Enforcement Agency regulations, or the cost of compliance with these regulations, may adversely affect our business.\nOur sufentanil-based products are subject to extensive regulation by the DEA, due to their status as scheduled drugs. Sufentanil is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance, considered to present a high risk of abuse. The manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of controlled substances are subject to a high degree of regulation, including security, record-keeping and reporting obligations enforced by the DEA and also by comparable state agencies. In addition, our contract manufacturers are required to maintain relevant licenses and registrations. This high degree of regulation can result in significant compliance costs, which may have an adverse effect on the commercialization of DSUVIA and the development and commercialization of Zalviso, if approved.\nThe DEA limits the availability and production of all Schedule II controlled substances, including sufentanil, through a quota system. The DEA requires substantial evidence and documentation of expected legitimate medical and scientific needs before assigning quotas to manufacturers. Our contract manufacturers apply for quotas on our behalf. We will need significantly greater amounts of sufentanil to successfully commercialize DSUVIA, to support European commercialization of DZUVEO and Zalviso, and to commercialize Zalviso, if approved in the United States. Any delay by the DEA in establishing the procurement quota, reduction in our quota for sufentanil, failure to increase our quota over time to meet anticipated increases in demand, or refusal by the DEA to establish the procurement quota could delay or stop the commercial sale of our approved products or the clinical development of Zalviso in the United States. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur relationships with clinical investigators, health care professionals, consultants, commercial partners, third-party payers, hospitals, and other customers are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws, which could expose us to penalties.\nHealthcare providers, including physicians, and others play a primary role in the recommendation and prescribing of any products for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, commercial partners, hospitals, third-party payers and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute the products for which we obtain marketing approval. Applicable federal and state healthcare laws include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022 the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or from knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which, among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly or willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which impose certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on covered healthcare providers, health plans and clearinghouses, and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, as well as their covered subcontractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022 foreign laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance which govern the collection, use, disclosure, retention, security and transfer of personal data, including the European Union General Data Privacy Regulation, or GDPR, which introduces strict requirements for processing personal data of individuals within the European Union;\n\u2022 the federal transparency law, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies to report annually to the CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians, (defined to include, doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year;\n\u2022 analogous state laws that may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines; state laws that impose restrictions on pharmaceutical companies\u2019 marketing practices and require manufacturers to track and file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking and reporting gifts, compensation and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, with differing effects; and,\n\u2022 the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage.\nRecently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with United States or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other healthcare regulatory laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, increased losses and diminished profits, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses or divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nIn order to supply the Zalviso device to any future collaborator for commercial sales in Europe, we must maintain conformity of our quality system to applicable ISO standards and must comply with applicable European laws and directives.\nWe underwent a Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne approval process for the Zalviso device, more commonly known as a CE Mark approval process. We received CE Mark approval in December 2014, which permits the commercial sale of the Zalviso device in Europe. In connection with the CE Mark approval, we were also granted International Standards Organization, or ISO, 13485:2003 certification of our quality management system in November 2014. This is an internationally recognized quality standard for medical devices. The CE Mark was originally issued by the British Standards Institution, or BSI, a Notified Body, or NB, located in the United Kingdom, or U.K., or BSI-U.K. The CE Mark file and certification has been transferred to the Netherlands NB of BSI, or BSI-NL, to mitigate the uncertainty with regards to Brexit. The ISO certification issued through BSI-U.K. was recently upgraded to the latest version of the standard, ISO 13485:2016 through BSI-U.K. and remains in effect. BSI ISO 13485:2016 certification recognizes that consistent quality policies and procedures are in place for the development, design and manufacturing of medical devices. The certification indicates that we have successfully implemented a quality system that conforms to ISO 13485 standards for medical devices. Certification to this standard is one of the key regulatory requirements for a CE Mark in the EU and European Economic Area (which includes the 27 EU member states as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), or EEA, as well as to meet equivalent requirements in other international markets. The certification applies to the Redwood City, California location which designs, manufactures and distributes finished medical devices, and includes critical suppliers. If we fail to remain in compliance with applicable European laws and directives, we would be unable to continue to affix the CE Mark to our Zalviso device, which would prevent any future collaboration partner from selling these devices within the EU and EEA.\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data security incidents could result in significant financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm to us.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit large amounts of sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, personal information and other confidential information. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such sensitive information. We have also outsourced elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology infrastructure) to third parties, and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our computer networks or our confidential information. In addition, many of those third parties in turn subcontract or outsource some of their responsibilities to third parties. While all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches, incidents, attacks and exposures, the accessibility and distributed nature of our information technology systems, and the sensitive information stored on those systems, make such systems potentially vulnerable to unintentional or malicious internal and external attacks on our technology environment. Potential vulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties. Attacks of this nature are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d nation states and others. In addition to the extraction of sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices increases the risk of data security incidents.\nSignificant disruptions of our third-party vendors\u2019 and/or business partners\u2019 information technology systems or other similar data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations and result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm to us. In addition, information technology system disruptions, whether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nThere is no way of knowing with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that have not been discovered. While we have no reason to believe this to be the case, attackers have become very sophisticated in the way they conceal access to systems, and many companies that have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including but not limited to personal information regarding our patients or employees, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable federal and state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us, and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm. In addition, any failure or perceived failure by us or our vendors or business partners to comply with our privacy, confidentiality or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or any further security incidents or other inappropriate access events that result in the unauthorized access, release or transfer of sensitive information, which could include personally identifiable information, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others, and could cause third parties, including clinical sites, regulators or current and potential partners, to lose trust in us or we could be subject to claims by third parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects. Moreover, data security incidents and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures intended to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent service interruptions or security incidents.\nBusiness interruptions could delay our operations and sales efforts.\nOur headquarters is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. Our contract manufacturers, suppliers, clinical trial sites and local and national transportation vendors are all subject to business interruptions due to weather, outbreaks of pandemic diseases, natural disasters, or man-made incidents. We are also vulnerable to other types of natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations. If any of these events occurred and prevented us or third parties on which we rely from using all or a significant portion of our or their facilities, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business and operations for a substantial period of time.\nWe do not carry insurance for earthquakes or other natural disasters, and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on principal members of our executive team, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. While we have entered into offer letters with each of our executive officers, any of them could leave our employment at any time, as all of our employees are \u201cat will\u201d employees. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, manufacturing, and commercial personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. In addition, failure to succeed in clinical trials, or delays in the regulatory approval process, may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive or key employee might impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nWe may acquire companies, product candidates or products or engage in strategic transactions, which could divert our management\u2019s attention and cause us to incur various costs and expenses.\nWe may acquire or invest in companies, product candidates or products that we believe could complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions or investments may divert the attention of management and has caused, and in the future may cause, us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing them, whether or not they are consummated. We may not be able to identify desirable acquisitions or investments or be successful in completing or realizing anticipated benefits from such transactions. In addition, the acquisition of product candidates and products is a highly competitive area, and many other companies are pursuing the same or similar product candidates to those that we may consider attractive. Larger companies with more well-established and diverse revenue streams may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, financial resources and more extensive clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nIn addition, we may receive inquiries relating to potential strategic transactions, including collaborations, licenses, and acquisitions. Such potential transactions may divert the attention of management and may cause us to incur various costs and expenses in investigating and evaluating such transactions, whether or not they are consummated.\nWe face potential product liability claims, and, if such claims are successful, we may incur substantial liability.\nCommercial sales of DSUVIA and Zalviso expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by patients, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 impairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022 costs due to related litigation;\n\u2022 distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022 the inability to commercialize our products; and,\n\u2022 decreased demand for our products.\nOur current product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. In addition, our current product liability insurance contains an exclusion related to any claims related to our products from a governmental body, or payer, or those claims arising from a multi-plaintiff action for bodily injury or property damage. Multi-plaintiff claims caused by product defects are covered. This exclusion does not apply to any bodily injury claim related to our products made by an individual. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments are excluded from our insurance coverage or exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.\nOur insurance coverage included the sale of Zalviso to our former commercial partner, Gr\u00fcnenthal, and will likely include the sale of Zalviso by any future commercial partner. We intend to commercialize and promote DZUVEO in Europe with a strategic partner which may result in further expansion of our insurance coverage to include sales of DZUVEO in Europe. There can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate to protect us against any future losses due to liability.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, investigators, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct that violates (1) regulations implemented by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory bodies; (2) laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies; (3) healthcare fraud and abuse laws of the United States and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws; and (4) laws requiring the reporting of financial information or data accurately. The promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent misconduct, including fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee and other third-party misconduct. The precautions we take to detect and prevent inappropriate conduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we cannot defend our issued patents from third party claims or if our pending patent applications fail to issue, our business could be adversely affected.\nTo protect our proprietary technology, we rely on patents as well as other intellectual property protections including trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, and confidentiality provisions. As of December 31, 2020, we are the owner of record of 81 issued patents worldwide. These issued patents cover AcelRx\u2019s sufentanil sublingual tablet, medication delivery devices and other platform technology. These issued patents include patents we have listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book for DSUVIA and patents expected to provide coverage until 2031. These issued patents also include a European patent covering the DZUVEO device that is expected to provide coverage until at least 2036.\nBecause sufentanil is not a new chemical entity, its regulatory exclusivity period in the United States is limited to three years under the Hatch-Waxman Act. While the FDA may not approve a 505(b)(2) NDA or abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, using DSUVIA as its reference listed drug prior to November 2, 2021, we may be subject to certification based on the patents we have listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book for DSUVIA and engage in litigation against such a 505(b)(2) or ANDA applicant at any time.\nIn addition, we are pursuing a number of U.S. non-provisional patent applications and foreign national applications directed to DSUVIA and Zalviso. The patent applications that we have filed and have not yet been granted may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the patents.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on successfully defending our current patents against third party challenges and expanding our existing patent portfolio to provide additional layers of patent protection, as well as extending patent protection. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending our existing and future patents against third party challenges, or that our pending patent applications will result in additional issued patents.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies, including ours, can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States. Legal developments may preclude or limit the scope of available patent protection.\nThere is also no assurance that any patents issued to us will not become the subject of adversarial proceedings such as opposition, inter partes review, post-grant review, reissue, supplemental examination, re-examination or other post-issuance proceedings. In addition, there is no assurance that the respective court or agency in such adversarial proceedings would not make unfavorable decisions, such as reducing the scope of a patent of ours or determining that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable. There is also no assurance that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages, will not be challenged by any third parties, or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology. Furthermore, there can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate any of our products, or design around our patents.\nLitigation involving patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights is expensive and time consuming. If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing our products to market and interfere with our business.\nOur commercial success depends in part on not infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Although we are not currently aware of litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to DSUVIA or Zalviso, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.\nAs we enter our target markets, it is possible that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products and/or processes infringe on their intellectual property rights. These third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents covering products or processes that are similar to, or may include compositions or methods that encompass our technology, allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes on these patents.\nIn a patent infringement claim against us, we may assert, as a defense, that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims, that the patent is invalid or both. The strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents, and our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. However, we could be unsuccessful in advancing non-infringement and invalidity arguments in our defense. In the United States, issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. Conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a lower burden of proof.\nIf we were found by a court to have infringed a valid patent claim, we could be prevented from using the patented technology and be required to pay the owner of the patent for damages for past sales and for the right to license the patented technology for future sales. If we decide to pursue a license to one or more of these patents, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or the license we obtain may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patent rights. For example, if the relevant patent is owned by a competitor, that competitor may choose not to license patent rights to us. If we decide to develop alternative technology, we may not be able to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all.\nIn addition, because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products.\nIt is possible that we may in the future receive communications from competitors and other companies alleging that we may be infringing their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights, offering licenses to such intellectual property or threatening litigation. In addition to patent infringement claims, third parties may assert copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights against us. We may need to expend considerable resources to counter such claims and may not be successful in our defense. Our business may suffer if a finding of infringement is established.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States. The pharmaceutical patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.\nWe cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that may be issued from the applications we currently, or may in the future, own or license from third parties. Claims could be brought regarding the validity of our patents by third parties and regulatory agencies. Further, if any patent license we obtain is deemed invalid and/or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or partner our technology.\nCompetitors or third parties may infringe our patents. We may decide it is necessary to file patent infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or that the third party\u2019s technology does not in fact infringe upon our patents. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related pending patent applications at risk of not issuing. Litigation may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries outside the United States where patent rights may be more difficult to enforce. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during the course of litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022 we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or issued patents;\n\u2022 our patent applications were filed before the inventions covered by each patent or patent application was published by a third party;\n\u2022 we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022 others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022 any patents issued to us or our collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties; or,\n\u2022 the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize DSUVIA and Zalviso, if approved, and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and applications will be due to be paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications.\nWe have systems in place, including use of third party vendors, to manage payment of periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other patent and application fees. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. Additionally, claims may be brought regarding the validity of our patents by third parties and regulatory agencies in the United States and foreign countries. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks in all our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have registered our ACELRX mark in the United States, Canada, the EU and India. In early 2014, the FDA accepted the Zalviso mark and, in November 2018, the FDA accepted the DSUVIA mark. Although we are not currently aware of any oppositions to or cancellations of our registered trademarks or pending applications, it is possible that one or more of the applications could be subject to opposition or cancellation after the marks are registered. The registrations will be subject to use and maintenance requirements. It is also possible that we have not yet registered all of our trademarks in all of our potential markets, such as securing the registration of DSUVIA in Canada, and that there are names or symbols other than \u201cACELRX\u201d that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has experienced significant volatility and is likely to be volatile in the future. For example, the closing price of our common stock ranged between $3.93 and $1.66 during 2019, and between $0.76 and $2.07 during 2020. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022 failure to successfully commercialize DSUVIA in the United States or to successfully develop and commercialize Zalviso in the United States;\n\u2022 inability to obtain additional funding needed to conduct our planned business operations;\n\u2022 the integration and performance of any businesses or assets we may acquire;\n\u2022 uncertainties regarding the magnitude and duration of impacts we are experiencing due to COVID-19;\n\u2022 the perception of limited market sizes or pricing for our products;\n\u2022 further delays in resubmitting the NDA for Zalviso, and any additional adverse developments or perceived adverse developments with respect to the FDA\u2019s review of the Zalviso NDA, upon resubmission;\n\u2022 inability to enter into, or unfavorable terms associated with, a New Arrangement for the commercialization of Zalviso in Europe;\n\u2022 safety issues;\n\u2022 adverse results or delays in future clinical trials;\n\u2022 changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products;\n\u2022 inability to obtain adequate product supply for our products, or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022 adverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022 changes in the structure of the healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022 inability to maintain ISO 13485 certification and CE Mark approval for Zalviso;\n\u2022 introduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022 failure to meet or exceed financial projections we provide to the public;\n\u2022 failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022 decisions by our collaboration partners regarding market access, pricing, and commercialization efforts in countries where they have the right to commercialize our products;\n\u2022 failure to maintain our existing collaborations or enter into new collaborations;\n\u2022 the perception of the pharmaceutical industry generally, and of opioid manufacturers more specifically, by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022 announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or other significant transactions, including disposition transactions, or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 disputes or other developments relating to employment matters, business development efforts, proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel;\n\u2022 costs associated with potential governmental investigations, inquiries, regulatory actions or lawsuits that may be brought against us as a result of us being an opioid manufacturer;\n\u2022 other types of significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022 changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and\n\u2022 trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nBecause we will continue to need additional capital in the future to continue to expand our business and our research and development activities, among other things, we may conduct additional equity offerings. For example, under the universal shelf registration statement filed by us in June 2020 and declared effective by the SEC in July 2020, we may offer and sell any combination of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings, up to a cumulative value of $150 million. To date, we have approximately $54.5 million remaining under such universal shelf registration statement. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants under our equity incentive plans. Grants under our equity incentive plans may also cause our stockholders to experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall. We may also issue shares of our common stock as consideration in mergers, acquisitions and other business development transactions. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock. All of our shares of common stock outstanding are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Sales of stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur involvement in securities-related class action litigation could divert our resources and management's attention and harm our business.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of pharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the market price of our common stock may vary significantly based on AcelRx-specific events, such as receipt of future complete response letters, negative clinical results, a negative vote or decision by an FDA advisory committee, or other negative feedback from the FDA, EMA, or other regulatory agencies. In the past, securities-related class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with their investigational drug candidate development programs and the FDA's review of their NDAs.\nIf AcelRx experiences a decline in its stock price, we could face additional securities class action lawsuits. Securities class actions are often expensive and can divert management\u2019s attention and our financial resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $264.4 million, of which $114.9 million federal net operating losses generated before January 1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2029. Federal net operating losses of $149.5 million generated after January 1, 2018 will carryforward indefinitely but are subject to the 80% taxable income limitation. As of December 31, 2020, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $141.5 million, which begin to expire in 2028.\nOur ability to use our federal and state net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the net operating losses, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of our net operating losses. Federal net operating losses generated prior to 2018 will continue to be governed by the net operating loss tax rules as they existed prior to the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, which means that generally they will expire 20 years after they were generated if not used prior thereto. Many states have similar laws. Accordingly, our federal and state net operating losses could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the newly enacted Tax Act as modified by CARES Act, federal net operating losses incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 may be carried back to each of the five tax years preceding such loss, and federal net operating losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 may not be carried back. Moreover, federal net operating losses generated in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited to 80% of current year taxable income for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. The completion of the July 2013 public equity offering, together with our public equity offering in December 2012, our initial public offering, private placements and other transactions that have occurred, have triggered such an ownership change. In addition, since we will need to raise substantial additional funding to finance our operations, we may undergo further ownership changes in the future. In the future, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset United States federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\nWe are subject to taxation in numerous U.S. states and territories. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. Nevertheless, our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including passage of the newly enacted federal income tax law, changes in the mix of our profitability from state to state, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations and may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we are prohibited from doing so under the terms of the Loan Agreement. Regardless of the restrictions in the Loan Agreement or the terms of any potential future indebtedness, we anticipate that we will retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business and, therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022 authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u2022 a staggered Board of Directors;\n\u2022 prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022 eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our Board of Directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us.", "PERMNO": 12573, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ACRX"}
