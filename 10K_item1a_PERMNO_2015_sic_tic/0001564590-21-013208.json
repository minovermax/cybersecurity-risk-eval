{"cik": "717806", "company": "FIRST US BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nMaking or continuing an investment in our common stock involves certain risks that you should carefully consider. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on us. Additional risks and uncertainties also could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of your common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has adversely impacted our business, and the ultimate effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including the severity, scope and duration of the pandemic, its cumulative economic effects and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nBeginning in 2020, the global pandemic related to COVID-19 began to impact the worldwide economy and our results of operations. Because of the size and breadth of this pandemic, all of the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known and may not emerge for some time. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and may for some time continue to result, in illness, increased unemployment, temporary closures of many businesses, disruption to trade, travel, employee productivity and other economic activities, and destabilization of financial markets and economic activity. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of the states in which we operate, and of most other states, have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain, cannot be predicted and will depend on certain developments, including, among others, the severity, scope and duration of the pandemic, its impact on our customers, employees and vendors, and the continued governmental, regulatory and private sector responses, which may be precautionary, to the coronavirus.\nRisks presented by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic include the following:\n\u2022\nImpact to Financial Markets. There has been, and we may continue to experience, significant volatility in U.S. financial markets, including equity, fixed-income and commodity markets, and in our investment securities portfolio. Actual and potential declines in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the markets that we serve, caused us to increase our loan loss provision during the year ended December 31, 2020 and may lead to further increased provisions for loan losses and increases in our allowance for loan and lease losses. Even after the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy may experience a recession, and the Company anticipates that the Company\u2019s businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession.\n\u2022\nInterest Rate Environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a number of Federal Reserve actions. Market interest rates have declined significantly, which has caused a decrease in our net interest margin. We expect that these reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, could continue to adversely affect our net interest income and margins and our profitability.\n\u2022\nLoan Deferments and At-Risk Loans. The Company has implemented initiatives, and may implement additional or expanded initiatives, to provide short-term payment relief to borrowers who have been negatively impacted by COVID-19, such as a deferral of loan payments and the suspension of foreclosures due to unfavorable market conditions. In accordance with the Company\u2019s uniform framework for establishing and monitoring credit risk, management will continue to closely evaluate all loans that request and receive COVID-19 deferments or that are considered to be \u201cat-risk\u201d with respect to the pandemic. However, there continues to be a significant level of uncertainty as to the ultimate impact that the pandemic will have on these borrowers, and such initiatives or accommodations may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, revenues and results of operations in the near term and, if not effective in mitigating the effect of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s customers, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time. Loan modifications and payment deferrals may also increase our credit risks.\n\u2022\nImpact on our Customers\u2019 Financial Condition. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying those loans, and demand for loans and other products and services that the Company offers, which are highly dependent on the business environment in the Company\u2019s primary markets and the U.S. economy as a whole. Further, the Company\u2019s loan\ndeferment program could make it difficult to identify the extent of asset quality deterioration, or otherwise delay the identification of such deterioration, during the deferment period.\n\u2022\nReduced Demand. There has been and may continue to be reduced consumer spending resulting from job losses and other effects of the pandemic. Reduced demand for the Bank\u2019s banking products and services could negatively impact, among other things, our liquidity, regulatory capital and growth strategy. Our asset size and the amounts of deposits from our customers have and may continue to fluctuate significantly based on changes in the financial behaviors of our deposit customers.\n\u2022\nRegulation. The effects of government fiscal and monetary policies enacted in response to the pandemic or its economic impact on the economy and financial stability, generally, and on our business, results of operations and financial condition cannot be predicted.\n\u2022\nBusiness Disruption. The Company and the Bank have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions to the conduct of business due to the following:\no\nAdverse effects to employees\u2019 health, which may necessitate their recovery away from work;\no\nShelter in place regulations, or other restrictions and interruptions of our business and contact with our customers;\no\nUnavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s business activities;\no\nSustained closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers;\no\nInability to provide customer support; and\no\nInability of vendors and third-party service providers to work or provide services effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic.\nAs we sought to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers during the year ended December 31, 2020, we took numerous actions to modify our business operations, including restricting employee travel, directing a significant percentage of our employees that were able to do so to work from home, closing the lobbies of many of our branches, and, in some cases, the branch itself, and implementing our business continuity plans and protocols. If the Company is unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022\nSecurity Concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to or resulted in heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements and increased levels of remote access. Cybercriminals increased their attempts to compromise business and consumer e-mails, including phishing attempts, and fraudulent vendors or other parties have viewed the pandemic as an opportunity to prey upon consumers and businesses during this time. This could result in increased fraud losses to us or our customers. The increase in online and remote banking activities may also increase the risk of fraud against our customers.\n\u2022\nIncrease in Expenses. In the near-term, non-interest expense may increase due to expenditures incurred by the Company in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny of the above events could cause, contribute to or exacerbate the other risks and uncertainties enumerated below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or otherwise in this report, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We have implemented our business contingency plan and taken other precautions with respect to the COVID-19 global pandemic. However, such measures may not adequately protect our business from the full impacts of the pandemic.\nSince the Bank is a participating lender in the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), the Company and the Bank are subject to additional risks of litigation from the Bank\u2019s customers or other parties regarding the Bank\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guarantees.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act, which included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. The Bank participated as a lender in the PPP. The PPP opened on April 3, 2020; however, because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there was and is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes the Company to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. Congress approved\napproximately $310 billion of additional funding for the PPP on April 24, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining balance of PPP loans originated by the Company totaled $11.9 million.\nIn December 2020, President Trump signed an additional relief bill which provides for $284 billion in new funding for PPP loans. In January 2021, the SBA initiated a new program to allow SBA lenders to begin obtaining approval for new PPP loans. The Bank has begun processing new applications.\nSince the opening of the PPP, several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. The Company and the Bank may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Bank regarding PPP loans, regarding the process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against the Company or the Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company or the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans, if the SBA determines deficiencies in the manner in which PPP loans were originated, funded or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, including those related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the PPP\u2019s operation. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there were deficiencies in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced by the Company, the SBA may deny its liability under the PPP loan guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company. Similar issues may also result in the denial of forgiveness of PPP loans, which would adversely affect and could result in losses, including possible bankruptcies, which may expose us to further costs and potential losses.\nCredit Risks\nIf loan losses are greater than anticipated, our earnings may be adversely affected.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans. Our credit risk with respect to our real estate and construction loan portfolio relates principally to the creditworthiness of individuals and the value of the real estate serving as security for the repayment of loans, and the credit risk with respect to our commercial and consumer loan portfolio relates principally to the general creditworthiness of businesses and individuals within the local markets in which we operate. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for potential loan losses based on a number of factors. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate. However, if estimates, assumptions or judgments used in calculating this allowance are incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual loan losses. Deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, inaccurate management assumptions, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may result in higher levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs and loan losses in excess of our current allowance for loan losses, requiring us to make material additions to our allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot be determined at this time and may vary from the amounts of past provisions. In addition, banking regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further charge-offs if the regulators\u2019 judgments are different than those of our management. Material additions to the allowance could materially decrease our net income.\nIn accordance with section 4013 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the Company implemented initiatives to provide short-term payment relief to borrowers who have been negatively impacted by COVID-19. Over 1,900 of the Company\u2019s borrowers requested and were granted pandemic-related deferments by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2020. Although the interpretive guidance defines short-term as six months, the majority of deferments granted by the Company were for terms of 90 days or less. As of December 31, 2020, 110 borrowers with an aggregate principal balance totaling approximately $8.1 million had active loan payment deferments. The deferments could contribute to higher credit losses.\nWe may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses as a result of a recent change to an accounting standard.\nThe measure of our allowance for loan losses depends in part on the adoption and interpretation of accounting standards. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, recently issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. This ASU provides a new credit impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL model, which, as a result of a delay in implementation for smaller reporting companies announced by the FASB during the fourth quarter of 2019, will apply to us in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. CECL will require financial institutions to estimate and develop a provision for credit losses at origination for the lifetime of the loan, as opposed to reserving for incurred or probable losses up to the balance sheet date. Under the CECL model, credit deterioration would be reflected in the income statement in the period of origination or acquisition of the loan, with changes in expected credit losses due to further credit deterioration or improvement reflected in the periods in which the expectation changes. Accordingly, implementation of the CECL model will change our current method of providing allowances for loan losses, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. Moreover, the CECL model likely would create more volatility in our level of allowance for loan losses. We expect to recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to the allowance for loan and lease losses as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2023, equal to the difference between the amount of our allowance under the incurred loss methodology and under CECL. However, we cannot yet\ndetermine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations. A material increase in our level of allowance for loan losses could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMarket and Industry Risks\nOur business and operations may be materially adversely affected by national and local market economic conditions.\nOur business and operations, which primarily consist of banking activities, including lending money to customers in the form of loans and borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States generally, and in our local markets in particular. If economic conditions in the United States or any of our local markets weaken, our growth and profitability from our operations could be constrained. The current economic environment is characterized by interest rates near historically low levels, which impacts our ability to attract deposits and to generate attractive earnings through our loan and investment portfolios. All of these factors can individually or in the aggregate be detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Unfavorable market conditions can result in a deterioration in the credit quality of our borrowers and the demand for our products and services, an increase in the number of delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, additional provisions for loan losses, a decline in the value of our collateral, and an overall material adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio.\nThe economic conditions in our local markets may be different from the economic conditions in the United States as a whole. Our success depends to a certain extent on the general economic conditions of the geographic markets that we serve in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia. Local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on our commercial, real estate and construction loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Adverse changes in the economic conditions of the southeastern United States in general or any one or more of these local markets could negatively impact the financial results of our banking operations and have a negative effect on our profitability. For example, significant unemployment in the timber industry could cause widespread economic distress in many of the areas that we serve. Similar trends in other industries or sectors that we serve could have a significant negative effect on our profitability.\nFor a discussion of the impact of and the ongoing risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see \u201cRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above.\nThe banking industry is highly competitive, which could result in loss of market share and adversely affect our business.\nWe encounter strong competition in making loans, acquiring deposits and attracting customers for investment services. We compete with commercial banks, online banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment banking companies, brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries operating in our markets and elsewhere in various segments of the financial services market. Many of these competitors, some of which are affiliated with large bank holding companies, have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do. In addition, many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks, and, as a result, may be able to offer certain products and services at a lower cost than we are able to offer, which could adversely affect our business.\nRapid and significant changes in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance.\nMost of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and are therefore subject to significant risks from changes in interest rates. Our profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, and changes in interest rates can impact our net interest income as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities. Our consolidated results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates and our ability to manage interest rate risks. Changes in market interest rates, changes in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates and changes in the relationships between different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. These differences could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income or a decrease in our interest rate spread. For a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies for these risks, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Our net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely out of our control, including competition, federal economic monetary and fiscal policies and general economic conditions. Despite the implementation of strategies to manage interest rate risks, changes in interest rates may have a material adverse impact on our profitability.\nThe performance of our investment portfolio is subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates and market conditions.\nChanges in interest rates can negatively affect the performance of most of our investments. Interest rate volatility can reduce gains or create losses in our investment portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect returns on, and the market value of, investment securities. The fair market value of the securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities also fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other\nasset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. The potential effect of these factors is heightened due to the current conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur consolidated results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve include open market operations in United States government securities, changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, we cannot predict future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or our business and earnings. Furthermore, the actions of the United States government and other governments in responding to such conditions may result in currency fluctuations, exchange controls, market disruption and other adverse effects.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of large banks, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), selected, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started in April 2018 to publish, the Secured Overnight Finance Rate, or SOFR, as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, given the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. Furthermore, the Bank of England has commenced publication of a reformed Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), comprised of a broader set of overnight Sterling money market transactions, as of April 23, 2018. The SONIA has been recommended as the alternative to Sterling LIBOR by the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates.\nWhile we expect LIBOR to continue to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021 or shortly before that, it is possible that LIBOR quotes will become unavailable prior to that point. This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. These risks may also be increased due to the shorter time for preparing for the transition. On March 5, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of LIBOR, released the much-anticipated feedback statement (\u201cCessation Statement\u201d) reporting the results of its December 2020 Consultation on potential Cessation. Pursuant to the Cessation Statement, IBA intends to cease publication of (i) the 1 Week and 2 Month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and (ii) the Overnight and 1, 3, 6 and 12 Month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023, subject to any rights of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), the regulatory supervisor of IBA, to compel IBA to continue publication using a changed methodology. The outcome of these actions and their impact on LIBOR could materially affect the economics as well as the timing of the transition away from LIBOR.\nAt this time, it is impossible to predict whether SOFR and SONIA will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities in our portfolio and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Privacy and Technology\nTechnological changes in the banking and financial services industries may negatively impact our results of operations and our ability to compete.\nThe banking and financial services industries are undergoing rapid changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to enhancing the level of service provided to customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. To remain competitive, financial institutions must continuously evaluate changing customer preferences with respect to emerging technologies and develop plans to address such changes in the most cost-effective manner possible. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to use technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and create additional efficiencies in operations, and our failure to do so could negatively impact our business. Additionally, our competitors may have greater resources to invest in technological\nimprovements than we do, and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, which could reduce our ability to effectively compete.\nOur information systems may experience a failure or interruption.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption in the operation of these systems could impair or prevent the effective operation of our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, lending or other functions. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure or interruption in the operation of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions impacting our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use information technology in our operations and offer online banking services to our customers, and unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information as a result of a cyber-attack or otherwise could expose us to reputational harm and litigation and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties. We are under continuous threat of loss due to hacking and cyber-attacks, especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the internet and other remote channels to transact business. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking channels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers. Therefore, the secure processing, transmission and storage of information in connection with our online banking services are critical elements of our operations. However, our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other malware, phishing schemes or other security failures. In addition, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PCs or other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems in order to access our products and services. Our technologies, systems and networks, and our customers\u2019 devices, may become the target of cyber-attacks, electronic fraud or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, use, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against these threats or to alleviate or investigate problems caused by such threats. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the processing, storage or transmission of confidential customer information, any breaches or unauthorized access to such information could present significant regulatory costs and expose us to litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent these types of security threats could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation and ability to generate deposits. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cyber threat event. While we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches to date, we may suffer such losses in the future. The occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result in potential legal liability, reputational harm, damage to our competitive position, additional compliance costs, and the disruption of our operations, all of which could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data, which exposes us to additional risk for cybersecurity breaches and regulatory action.\nWe rely on software and internet-based platforms developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, loan and deposit processing and securities portfolio accounting. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties, are subject to cybersecurity breaches or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other service providers on a timely basis, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we must rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over the security of customer data. In addition, we maintain, or contract with third parties to maintain, daily backups of key processing outputs in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems. Nonetheless, we may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct business or process transactions, or damage to our reputation, if the third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such a disruption or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, federal regulators have issued guidance outlining their expectations for third-party service provider oversight and monitoring by financial institutions. Any failure to adequately oversee the actions of our third-party service providers could result in\nregulatory actions against us, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Legal, Reputational and Compliance Matters\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and the costs of complying with such regulation could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state law. We are subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the ASBD. These regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors, the public and the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund, rather than shareholders. Additionally, we are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by other regulatory authorities, such as the SEC and state securities and insurance regulators. If, as a result of an examination, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC or the ASBD were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to require us to remediate any such adverse examination findings. We are also subject to changes in federal and state laws, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous change, and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Regulations and laws may be modified at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that could affect us. We cannot assure you that any changes in regulations or new laws will not adversely affect our performance or consolidated results of operations. Our regulatory framework is discussed in greater detail under \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nWe are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information, and any violation of these laws or unauthorized disclosure of such information could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We also maintain important internal data, such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties). For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which, among other things: (1) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (2) requires us to provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and to afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (3) requires us to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and state legislatures have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to ensure that all of our clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to unauthorized persons, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under applicable laws and regulations. Concerns about the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information could cause us to lose customers or potential customers for our products and services and thereby reduce our revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject us to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase and thereby adversely affect our financial results.\nThe Bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits, and, accordingly, the Bank is subject to periodic insurance assessments by the FDIC. The Bank\u2019s regular assessments are determined by its risk classification, which is based on its regulatory capital levels and the level of supervisory concern that it poses. Numerous bank failures during the financial crisis and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put significant pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, and any significant increase in insurance assessments would likely have an adverse effect on us.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action under the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. Our federal and state banking regulators, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and other government agencies are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of anti-money laundering requirements. We are also subject to increased scrutiny with respect to our compliance with the regulations issued and enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our program is deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines, civil money penalties and other regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our business operations and our ability to pay dividends, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have significant reputational consequences for us. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBancshares\u2019 liquidity is subject to various regulatory restrictions applicable to its subsidiaries.\nThere are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of Bancshares\u2019 subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to Bancshares. In addition, Bancshares\u2019 right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of its subsidiaries upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or otherwise will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of Bancshares\u2019 claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized.\nThe internal controls that we have implemented to mitigate risks inherent to the business of banking might fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls and procedures that are designed to manage the various risks in our business, including credit risk, operational risk, financial risk, compliance risk and interest rate risk. No system of controls, however well-designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. If such a system fails or is circumvented, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may adversely affect our financial results.\nThe enactment of federal tax reform has had, and is expected to continue to have, far reaching and significant effects on us, our customers and the United States economy. Further, the income tax treatment of corporations may at any time be clarified and/or modified through legislation, administration or judicial changes or interpretations. These changes or interpretations could adversely affect us, either directly or as a result of the effects on our customers.\nIn the course of our business, we are sometimes subject to challenges from taxing authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service, individual states and municipalities, regarding amounts due. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of which may require a greater provisioning for taxes or otherwise negatively affect our financial results.\nStrategic Risks\nWe intend to engage in acquisitions of other banking institutions from time to time. These acquisitions may not produce revenue or earnings enhancements or cost savings at levels, or within time frames, originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to strengthen our current market position through acquisitions, subject to regulatory approval. Such transactions could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short and long-term liquidity. Our acquisition activities could be material to our business. These activities could require us to use a substantial amount of cash or other liquid assets and/or incur debt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized. Our acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022\nincurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating the terms of potential transactions, resulting in our attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022\nbeing potentially exposed to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nchanges in asset quality and credit risk as a result of the transaction;\n\u2022\nbeing required to expend time and expense to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\nexperiencing higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations;\n\u2022\ncreating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nlosing key team members and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received; and\n\u2022\nincurring significant problems relating to the conversion of the financial and customer data of the entity being acquired into our financial and customer product systems.\nDepending on the condition of any institutions or assets that are acquired, any acquisition may, at least in the near term, materially adversely affect our capital and earnings and, if not successfully integrated following the acquisition, may continue to have such effects.\nGenerally, any acquisition of target financial institutions, banking centers or other banking assets by us may require approval by, and cooperation from, a number of governmental regulatory agencies, possibly including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, as well as state banking regulators. Such regulators could deny our application based on their regulatory criteria or other considerations, which could restrict our growth, or the regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us. For example, we could be required to sell banking centers as a condition to receiving regulatory approvals, and such a condition may not be acceptable to us or may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with pending or potential acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on levels of reported net income, return on equity and return on assets and the ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain market value.\nWe may not be able to maintain consistent growth, earnings or profitability.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow and to remain profitable in future periods, or, if profitable, that our overall earnings will remain consistent with our prior results of operations or increase in the future. Our growth in recent years has been driven by a number of factors, including strong growth in our indirect lending portfolio and demand in the commercial and real estate loan markets in certain of the communities that we serve. A downturn in economic conditions in our markets, heightened competition from other financial services providers, an inability to retain or grow our core deposit base, regulatory and legislative considerations, and failure to attract and retain high-performing talent, among other factors, could limit our ability to grow our assets or increase our profitability to the same extent as in recent periods. Sustainable growth requires that we manage our risks by following prudent loan underwriting standards, balancing loan and deposit growth without materially increasing interest rate risk or compressing our net interest margin, maintaining adequate capital, hiring and retaining qualified employees and successfully implementing our strategic initiatives. A failure to sustain our recent rate of growth or adequately manage the factors that have contributed to our growth or successfully enter new markets could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and profitability and, therefore on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGeneral Risks\nWe cannot guarantee that we will pay dividends in the future.\nDividends from the Bank are Bancshares\u2019 primary source of funds for the payment of dividends to its shareholders, and there are various legal and regulatory limits regarding the extent to which the Bank may pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Bancshares. The ability of both the Bank and Bancshares to pay dividends will continue to be subject to and limited by the results of operations of the Bank and by certain legal and regulatory restrictions. Further, any lenders making loans to Bancshares or the Bank may impose financial covenants that may be more restrictive than the legal and regulatory requirements with respect to the payment of dividends. There can be no assurance as to whether or when Bancshares may pay dividends to its shareholders.\nExtreme weather could cause a disruption in our operations, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nSome of our operations are located in areas near the Gulf of Mexico, a region that is susceptible to hurricanes and other forms of extreme weather. Such weather events could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. Further, a hurricane, tornado or other extreme weather event in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely impact the value of collateral that we hold.\nSecurities issued by us, including our common stock, are not insured.\nSecurities issued by us, including our common stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of any bank and are not insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund maintained by the FDIC or by any other governmental agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nFuture issuances of additional securities by us could result in dilution of your ownership.\nWe may decide from time to time to issue additional securities in order to raise capital, support growth or fund acquisitions. Further, we may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate employees. Such issuances of securities by us would dilute the respective ownership interests of our shareholders.\nOur common stock price could be volatile, which could result in losses for individual shareholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, business and political conditions;\n\u2022\nchanging market conditions in the broader stock market in general, or in the financial services industry in particular;\n\u2022\nmonetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations and other activities of the government, agencies and similar organizations;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet analyst predictions and projections;\n\u2022\ncollectability of loans;\n\u2022\ncost and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings, claims, settlements and judgments;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ntrades of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of innovations or new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nDue to these factors, you may not be able to sell your stock at or above the price you paid for it, which could result in substantial losses.\nOur performance and results of operations depend in part on the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine investment and banking transactions, as well as the quality and value of our investments in equity securities and obligations of other financial institutions, could be adversely affected by the actions, financial condition and profitability of such other financial institutions with which we transact, including, without limitation, the FHLBA and our correspondent banks. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of shared credits, trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor or counterparty confidence in certain institutions, and could lead to losses or defaults by other institutions. Any defaults by, or failures of, the institutions with whom we transact could adversely affect our debt and equity holdings in such other institutions, our participation interests in loans originated by other institutions, and our business, including our liquidity, consolidated financial condition and earnings.\nLiquidity risks could affect our operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the repayment or sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our funding sources include federal funds, purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements, core and non-core deposits, and short- and long-term debt. We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a source of liquidity. Other sources of liquidity are available should they be needed, such as through our acquisition of additional non-core deposits. Bancshares may be able, depending on market conditions, to issue and sell debt securities and preferred or common equity securities in public or private transactions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on acceptable terms could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial\nservices industry or economy in general, such as further disruption in the financial markets, negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry, deterioration within the credit markets, or the financial condition, liquidity or profitability of the financial institutions with which we transact.\nWe depend on the services of our management team and board of directors, and the unexpected loss of key officers or directors may adversely affect our operations.\nA departure of any of our executive officers, other key personnel or directors could adversely affect our operations. The community involvement of our executive officers and directors and our directors\u2019 diverse and extensive business relationships are important to our success. A material change in the composition of our management team or board of directors could cause our business to suffer.", "PERMNO": 88384, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FUSB"}
