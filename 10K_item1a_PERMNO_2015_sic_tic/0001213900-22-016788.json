{"cik": "1000683", "company": "BLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s business operates in a rapidly changing technology and economic environment that involves numerous risks, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The following \u201cRisk Factors\u201d highlight some of these risks. Additional risks not currently known to the Company or that the Company now deems immaterial may also affect the Company and the value of its common stock. The risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, should be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCommercial Risks\nAny substantial decrease in sales to our largest customers may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nApproximately 58% and 37% of our revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively, were derived from sales of products to the Company\u2019s five largest customers. None of these customers are obligated to purchase a material amount of products or to provide the Company with a material level of binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that sales to these entities, individually or as a group, will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. In addition, while the COVID-19 outbreak has affected and is continuing to affect the operations of our suppliers, and of our customers and our sales to them, uncertainty as to the effects on the economy generally and our semiconductor suppliers and customers in particular makes it impossible for us to predict the short term and long term effects the COVID-19 outbreak and related developments will have on our customers and their ongoing businesses and how those effects may impact our sales to them.\nWith respect to our direct sales to system integrators, the complement of our significant customers tends to vary over time as the most efficient and better-financed integrators tend to grow more rapidly than others. Our success with those customers will depend in part on:\n\u25cf the viability of those customers;\n\u25cf our ability to identify those customers with the greatest growth and growth prospects; and\n\u25cf our ability to maintain our position in the overall marketplace by shifting our emphasis to such customers.\nIn addition, three of our customers accounted for approximately 62% and 39% of our outstanding trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our significant customers, the financial failure of any of these entities, their inability to pay their trade accounts owing to us in a timely manner or at all, or our inability to develop solid relationships with integrators that may replace the present significant customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If the negative effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and related developments lead to financial difficulties or even the failure of one or more of our significant customers, or a combination of our smaller customers, our ability to collect payment in full and on a timely basis, or at all, may be adversely affected, and our working capital resources may be significantly diminished.\nAn inability to develop, or acquire the rights to technology, products or applications in response to changes in industry standards or customer needs may reduce our sales and profitability.\nBoth the private cable and franchised cable industries are characterized by the continuing advancement of technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs. To be successful, we must anticipate the evolution of industry standards and changes in customer needs, through the timely development and introduction of new products, enhancement of existing products and licensing of new technology from third parties. This is particularly true at this time as the Company must develop and market new digital products to offset the continuing decline in demand for, and therefore sales of, analog products. Although we depend primarily on our own research and development efforts to develop new products and enhancements to our existing products, we have and may continue to seek licenses for new technology from third parties when we believe that we can obtain such technology more quickly and/or cost-effectively from such third parties than we could otherwise develop on our own, or when the desired technology has already been patented by a third party. There can, however, be no assurance that new technology or such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us. There can be no assurance that:\n\u25cf we will be able to anticipate the evolution of industry standards in the telecommunications, cable television or the communications industry generally;\n\u25cf we will be able to anticipate changes in the market and customer needs;\n\u25cf technologies and applications under development by us will be successfully developed; or\n\u25cf successfully developed technologies and applications will achieve market acceptance.\nIf we are unable for technological or other reasons to develop and introduce products and applications or to obtain licenses for new technologies from third parties in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAnticipated increases in direct and indirect competition with us may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAll aspects of our business are highly competitive. We compete with international, national, regional and local manufacturers and distributors, including companies larger than us, which have substantially greater resources. Various manufacturers who are suppliers to us sell directly as well as through distributors into the cable television marketplace. Because of the convergence of the cable, telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development, new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by us. Many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and other resources than we have. We expect that direct and indirect competition will increase in the future. Additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition through:\n\u25cf price reductions;\n\u25cf loss of market share;\n\u25cf delays in the timing of customer orders; and\n\u25cf an inability to increase our penetration into the cable television market.\nOur sales and profitability may suffer due to any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by the telecommunications and cable infrastructure operators that we serve, as well as in the MDU, assisted living, lodging and institutional cable or telecommunications markets.\nThe vast majority of our revenues in 2021 and 2020 came from sales of our products for use by fiber, telco and cable infrastructure operators. Demand for our products depends to a large extent upon capital spending by telcos, cable operators and other entities on private cable systems and specifically by private cable operators for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading their systems. Capital spending by private cable operators and, therefore, our sales and profitability, are dependent on a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf access by private cable operators to financing for capital expenditures;\n\u25cf demand for their cable services;\n\u25cf availability of alternative video delivery technologies; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions.\nIn addition, our sales and profitability may in the future be more dependent on capital spending by traditional franchise cable system operators as well as by new entrants to this market planning to over-build existing cable system infrastructures, or constructing, rebuilding, maintaining and upgrading their systems. There can be no assurance that system operators in private cable or franchise cable will continue capital spending for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining, or upgrading their systems. Any substantial decrease or delay in capital spending by private cable or franchise cable operators would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetitors may develop products that are similar to, and compete with, our products due to our limited proprietary protection.\nWe possess limited patent or registered intellectual property rights with respect to the majority of our technology. We rely on a combination of patents, contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and know-how. There can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology and know-how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently. Therefore, existing and potential competitors may be able to develop similar products which compete with our products. Such competition could adversely affect the prices for our products or our market share and could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition.\nPatent infringement claims against us or our customers, whether or not successful, may cause us to incur significant costs.\nWhile we do not believe that our products (including products and technologies licensed from others) infringe valid intellectual property rights of any third parties, there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted against us or our customers. Damages for infringement of valid intellectual property rights of third parties could be substantial, and if determined to be willful, can be trebled. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation. Regardless of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unsuccessful in defending any claims or actions that are asserted against us or our customers, we could seek to obtain a license under a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance, however, that under such circumstances, a license would be available under reasonable terms or at all. The failure to obtain a license to a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nOur audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 included herein contain a \u201cgoing concern\u201d explanatory paragraph, expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced a decline in net sales, a loss from operations and a significant amount of cash used in operating activities, which was funded in large part from the proceeds we received from sales of our common stock and the proceeds from the Subordinated Loan Facility. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our becoming profitable in the future and having access to sufficient capital to execute our business plan and to meet our payment obligations on our debt financing arrangements and other financial obligations when they become due. We recently have been successful in obtaining additional capital through our Subordinated Loan Facility and the issuance of shares of our common stock. Although we believe that improvements in our sales and efforts to reduce expenses will increase the possibility that we will become profitable, and we have recently obtained the additional Subordinated Loan Facility and equity financing, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in improving our performance, that the additional financing obtained to date will be sufficient, or that we will be successful in securing additional financing on reasonable terms, or at all. These factors, and possibly others, raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our audited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern. As a result, you should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors and potentially be available for distribution to stockholders in the event of liquidation.\nThe terms of our credit facility with MidCap Business Credit may restrict our current and future operating and financial flexibility and could adversely affect our financial and operational results.\nOn October 25, 2019, the Company, entered into a new credit facility with MidCap Business Credit (\u201cMidCap\u201d), which was amended on April 7, 2020, January 8, 2021, June 14, 2021, July 30, 2021, August 26, 2021, December 16, 2021 and February 11, 2022. The Loan and Security Agreement between the Company and MidCap, as amended (the \u201cMidCap Agreement\u201d) includes a number of covenants that, among other things, may restrict our ability to:\n\u25cf engage in mergers, consolidations, asset dispositions or similar fundamental changes;\n\u25cf redeem or repurchase shares of Company stock;\n\u25cf create, incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf create, incur or permit liens on our assets;\n\u25cf make loans or investments;\n\u25cf pay cash dividends or make similar distributions; and\n\u25cf change the nature of our business.\nThese restrictions in the MidCap Agreement may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions that could be beneficial to us and our stockholders. In the event of a default, MidCap could elect to declare all borrowings, accrued and unpaid interest and other fees outstanding, due and payable and require us to use available cash to repay these borrowings, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. If MidCap terminates the MidCap Agreement or further limits our ability to borrow under the MidCap Agreement as a result of any failures to comply with any covenants, we would seek new debt financing arrangements. We cannot assure you that new debt financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, new debt financing, if available, could impose payment obligations, covenants and operating restrictions that are more onerous than under the MidCap Agreement, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe may face risks relating to currency fluctuations and currency exchange.\nHistorically the Company has had limited exposure to currency fluctuations since transactions with customers located outside the United States have generally been denominated in U.S. Dollars. In addition, the Company incurs certain expenses denominated in RMB in connection with its contract manufacturing activities in the PRC. The Company\u2019s functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, any expense denominated in Canadian Dollars or RMB needs to be translated into U.S. Dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Exchange rates between the RMB and U.S. Dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. We do not engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations. Currency fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nIncreased tariffs or other trade actions could adversely affect our business.\nThere is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies and tariffs. We source a variety of finished products and component parts from China. Although we currently believe that most of those products are not subject to tariffs, we cannot assure you that governmental authorities will agree with that position or that future actions may not be taken by the United States or China to impose tariffs on those products and components or otherwise affect our ability to source those products and components, which could have an adverse effect on our future operations. In addition, certain of the products we obtain from China are currently subject to tariffs. Although we do not expect that the currently-applicable tariffs will have an adverse effect on our results of operations, we have raised prices on certain products to attempt to offset the effect of those tariffs, and we are also considering alternative sources of supply from manufacturers in other countries and moving certain manufacturing activities to our Old Bridge New Jersey Facility as additional ways to mitigate the effect of those tariffs. If our expectations regarding the effect of the currently applicable tariffs prove to be incorrect and we are unable to offset or mitigate the effects of those tariffs, our future operating results may be adversely affected.\nOperational Risks\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by health events such as the recent Coronavirus or COVID-19 outbreak.\nOur business has been materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of the Coronavirus or COVID-19 and may in the future be materially and adversely affected by other epidemics and pandemic outbreaks. COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a \u201cpandemic,\u201d has spread to many countries, including the United States, and has impacted and continues to impact domestic and worldwide economic activity. A public health epidemic or pandemic, including COVID-19, poses the risk that the Company or its employees, customers, suppliers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Since being declared a \u201cpandemic\u201d, COVID-19 has interfered with our ability to meet with certain customers, has impacted and may continue to impact many of our customers and has disrupted and may continue to disrupt global supply chains. There are developments regarding the COVID-19 outbreak on a daily basis that may impact our customers, employees and business partners. As a result, it is not possible at this time to estimate the duration or the scope of the impact COVID-19 could have on the Company\u2019s business. However, the continued spread of COVID-19 and actions taken by our customers, suppliers and business partners, actions we take to protect the health and welfare of our employees, and measures taken by governmental authorities in response to COVID-19 could disrupt our manufacturing activities, the shipment of our products, the supply chain and purchasing decisions of our customers. The Company experienced a significant reduction in sales as a result of the decreased business activities of our customers related to the COVID-19 outbreak, and although we have experienced some increases in customer orders of our products, it remains unclear when or whether our customers will resume their activities at a level where our sales to them will return to historical levels. In addition, disruption of the global supply chain has had and continues to have an adverse impact on our ability to meet the demands or our customers, and it is unclear when these supply chains issues will be resolved. These uncertainties may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAn inability to reduce expenses or increase revenues may cause continued net losses.\nWe have had losses each year since 2010, with small net earnings of $84,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. While management believes its ongoing efforts to increase revenues should, and its ongoing efforts and demonstrated progress in reducing expenses may create future profitability, there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful. Failure to increase revenues or ability to maintain or reduce expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in order to address issues relating to our reduced sales and recent impacts in the predictability of global semiconductor supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented operating expense cost reductions and may need to implement additional cost reductions in the near term. If necessary additional reductions cannot be implemented in a timely manner or prove to be insufficient in offsetting or significantly mitigating reduced revenues, our ability to continue to operate as a going concern may be materially adversely affected.\nInventory reserves for excess or obsolete inventories may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continually analyze our excess or obsolete inventories. Based on historical and projected sales volumes and anticipated selling prices, we establish reserves. If we do not meet our sales expectations, these reserves are increased. Products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value. Although we believe reserves are adequate and inventories are reflected at net realizable value, there can be no assurance that we will not have to record additional inventory reserves in the future. Significant increases to inventory reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny significant casualty to our facility in Old Bridge, New Jersey may cause a lengthy interruption to our business operations.\nWe primarily operate out of one manufacturing facility in Old Bridge, New Jersey (the \u201cOld Bridge Facility\u201d). While we maintain a limited amount of business interruption insurance, a casualty that results in a lengthy interruption of our ability to manufacture at, or otherwise use, the Old Bridge Facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur dependence on certain third-party suppliers could create an inability for us to obtain component products not otherwise available or to do so only at increased prices.\nWe purchase several products from sole suppliers for which alternative sources are not available. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by:\n\u25cf an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components;\n\u25cf an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components within specific timeframes;\n\u25cf our receipt of a significant number of defective components;\n\u25cf an increase in component prices; or\n\u25cf our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive pressures on the pricing of our products.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the supply chain for many types of products and materials, particularly those being manufactured in China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and other countries where the outbreak has resulted in significant disruptions to ongoing business activities. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021 and continuing into the first quarter of 2022, the Company has experienced material disruption in our supply chain as it relates to the procurement of certain sole source and other multiple source components utilized in a material portion of a number of the Company\u2019s product lines. We believe this disruption may continue beyond 2022. If these or any similar types of supply disruptions continue, it is possible that we will be unable to complete sales of any affected products to our customers on requested schedules.\nOur manufacturing activities in the PRC, South Korea and Taiwan may subject us to the risks of unfavorable political, regulatory, legal and other developments in those countries.\nSome of our products are manufactured and assembled in the PRC, South Korea and Taiwan under contractual and purchasing arrangements with businesses in those countries. Our future operations and earnings may be adversely affected by the risks related to, or any other problems arising from, having our products manufactured and assembled in these countries:\n\u25cf political, economic and labor instability;\n\u25cf changes in foreign or United States government laws and regulations, including exchange control regulations;\n\u25cf infringement of our intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf difficulties in managing foreign manufacturing operations.\nIn addition, because the Company incurs certain expenses denominated in Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d) rather than U.S. Dollars in connection with contract manufacturing activities in the PRC, we may experience increased costs related to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. Although these countries have modern industrial economies, their potential economic, political, legal and labor developments could entail uncertainties and risks. In the event of any changes that adversely affect our ability to manufacture in the PRC, South Korea and/or Taiwan, our business could suffer.\nShifting our operations between regions may entail considerable expense.\nOver time we may shift additional portions of our manufacturing operations to outside third-party suppliers both within the US, North America, Europe, and/or Asian territories in order to maximize manufacturing and operational efficiency. This could result in reducing our domestic operations in the future, which in turn could entail significant one-time earnings charges to account for severance, equipment write-offs or write downs and moving expenses.\nAny increase in governmental regulation of the markets that we serve, including the cable television system, MDU, lodging and institutional markets, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe telecommunications, cable television, fiber optic, MDU, lodging and institutional markets within the cable industry, which represents the vast majority of our business, while in some cases subject to certain FCC licensing requirements, is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations. It is possible, however, that regulations could be adopted in the future which impose burdensome restrictions on these markets resulting in, among other things, barriers to the entry of new competitors or limitations on capital expenditures. Any such regulations, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPrivate cable system operation is not presently burdened with significant government regulation, other than, in some cases, certain FCC licensing and signal leakage requirements. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries. It is possible, however, that regulations could be adopted which would re-impose burdensome restrictions on franchise cable operators resulting in, among other things, the grant of exclusive rights or franchises within certain geographical areas. Any increased regulation of franchise cable could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny increase in governmental environmental regulations or our inability or failure to comply with existing environmental regulations may cause an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental regulations related to the storage, use, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes. We do not anticipate material capital expenditures during 2022 for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. There can be no assurance, however, that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on us. Further, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our operations. Any failure by us to obtain required permits for, control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability or could cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended. Such liability or suspension of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.\nAttempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated. Our systems are designed to detect security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have not identified any material incidents of unauthorized access to date, the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property, confidential business or personal information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, to the extent that any future security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our employees\u2019, licensees\u2019, or customers\u2019 confidential and /or personal information, we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy any damages caused by such breach. We could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.\nMacroeconomic Risks\nAdverse changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and earnings are affected by general business, economic and financial markets conditions in the United States and elsewhere. We continue to operate in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 outbreak and related events. Any return to recessionary conditions or prolonged stagnant or deteriorating economic conditions, whether related to the COVID-19 outbreak or otherwise, could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the demand for our products, the ability of our customers to make payments to us in a timely fashion or at all, our ability and the ability of our customers to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and other potential events that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our stock price could remain depressed or decrease if investors have concerns that our business, financial condition or results of operations will be negatively impacted by a worldwide economic downturn. Other uncertainties, including the potential effect of United States\u2019 tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which are important materials for the production of many of our products, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, beginning in early 2022 our business began to experience inflationary price increases in certain of our components. Although to date we have been successful in passing on these increases to our customers, there can be no assurances that we will continue to be able to do so. The inability to pass on these or future component cost increases could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHuman Capital Risks\nLosing the services of our executive officers or our other highly qualified and experienced employees, or our inability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced employees, could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key executives and technical and management personnel. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled engineering, manufacturing, marketing and managerial personnel. The competition for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key employees, in particular the principal members of our management and technical staff, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDelays or difficulties in negotiating a labor agreement or other difficulties in our relationship with our union employees may cause an adverse effect on our manufacturing and business operations.\nAll of our direct labor employees located at the Old Bridge, New Jersey facility are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union, Local 2066 (the \u201cUnion\u201d), under a collective bargaining agreement, which expires in February 2023. In connection with any renewal or renegotiation of the labor agreement upon its termination, there can be no assurance that work stoppages will not occur or that we will be able to agree upon terms for future agreements with the Union. Any work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nOther Risks\nAdditional issuances of shares of our common stock in the future could adversely affect the value or voting power of our outstanding common stock.\nOver the past two years we have issued a substantial number of shares of common stock and other securities convertible into, or exercisable for, a substantial number of additional shares of common stock. Although we cannot predict whether the holders of our securities that are convertible into, or exercisable for, shares of our common stock will convert and/or exercise those securities, or in what amounts, the actual or anticipated issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the future could cause the value of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and on terms that we deem appropriate. The issuance of any shares of our common stock in the future also would, and equity-related securities could, dilute the percentage ownership interest and voting power held by stockholders prior to such issuance. We have also entered arrangements with certain of our officers and our directors pursuant to which they have agreed to receive shares of our common stock in the future in lieu of current cash compensation. Although those arrangements help the Company preserve cash for operations, the issuances of the shares to those officers and directors also will have the effect of diluting the percentage ownership interest and voting power held by stockholders prior to such issuances.\nOur organizational documents and Delaware state law contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover or change in control of our company or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock, to determine the powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed upon any unissued series of undesignated Preferred Stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The Preferred Stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of the common stock. Furthermore, such Preferred Stock may have other rights, including economic rights, senior to the common stock, and as a result, the issuance of such stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock. In addition, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation:\n\u25cf eliminates the right of our stockholders to act without a meeting;\n\u25cf does not provide cumulative voting for the election of directors;\n\u25cf does not provide our stockholders with the right to call special meetings;\n\u25cf provides for a classified board of directors; and\n\u25cf imposes various procedural requirements which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect certain corporate actions.\nThese provisions and the Board\u2019s ability to issue Preferred Stock may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or offers from third parties to acquire the Company, preventing our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock, or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company. We are also afforded the protection of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could:\n\u25cf delay or prevent a change in control of the Company;\n\u25cf impede a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us; or\n\u25cf discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nAny of these provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.\nIt is unlikely that we will pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently intend to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business and therefore do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the MidCap Agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends by us on our common stock.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and subject to volatility, which may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock is currently traded on the NYSE American, it may at times be relatively illiquid, or \u201cthinly traded,\u201d which can increase share price volatility and make it difficult for investors to buy or sell shares in the public market without materially affecting the quoted share price. Investors may be unable to buy or sell a certain quantity of our shares in the public market within one or more trading days. If limited trading in our stock occurs, it may be difficult for holders to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices.\nThe prevailing market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our competitors or third parties;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our actual or anticipated results of operations;\n\u25cf failure of revenues or earnings in any quarter to meet the investment community\u2019s expectations;\n\u25cf market conditions for cable industry stocks in general;\n\u25cf broader market trends unrelated to our performance; and\n\u25cf sales of significant amounts of our common stock by our officers and directors or the perception that such shares may occur.\nThe uncertainties we face relating to our liquidity and ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and to continue to operate our business as a going concern also contributes to the volatility of our stock price, and any investment in our common stock could suffer a significant decline or total loss in value. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE American LLC or any other national securities exchange or over-the-counter market on which our common stock is then traded, which may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur share ownership is highly concentrated.\nOur directors and officers beneficially own, or have the right to vote, in the aggregate, approximately 42% of our common stock and will continue to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to the stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors. In addition, certain of our directors and officers will have the right to acquire additional shares of our common stock upon exercise of conversion rights with respect to certain indebtedness that acquire additional shares of common stock upon exercise of conversion rights with respect to certain indebtedness that they hold. See Note 6-Subordinated Convertible Debt with Related Parties in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur common stock has experienced and may continue to experience price and volume fluctuations, which could cause you to lose a significant portion of your investment.\nStock markets are subject to significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and accordingly the market price of our common stock may frequently and meaningfully change. The market prices and trading volume of our common stock have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations, which could cause purchasers of our common stock to incur substantial losses. For example, during 2021 and through March 18, 2022, the closing market price of our common stock has fluctuated from a low of $0.41 per share on February 24, 2022 to a high of $2.22 on February 9, 2021, with an intraday high of $2.33 per share on February 1, 2021 and an intraday low of $0.40 per share on February 24, 2022. The last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE American on March 18, 2022 was $0.64 per share. The daily trading volume in shares of our common stock has also experienced significant fluctuation. During 2021, through March 18, 2022, daily trading volume ranged from approximately 2,300 shares to 25,998,623 shares. We have not had any recent change in our financial condition or results of operations that we believe are consistent with recent fluctuations in our stock price or trading volume. Although we believe that the recent fluctuations in our stock price and trading volume reflect market and trading dynamics that appear to be unrelated to our underlying business, or to macro or industry fundamentals, we cannot be certain of the reasons for these fluctuations, nor can we predict how long these dynamics will last. These factors heighten the risk of an investment in our common stock, and the timing of your purchase of our common stock relative to fluctuations in its trading price may result in you losing all or a significant portion of your investment.\nSignificant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock may be the result of strong and substantially increased retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. The market price and trading volume fluctuations and trading patterns we have experienced create several risks for investors, including the following:\n\u25cf increases or decreases in the market price of our common stock may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, or macro or industry fundamentals, and inconsistent with the risks and uncertainties that we face;\n\u25cf factors in the volume of trading our common stock and the price at which the stock trades may include retail investors\u2019 sentiment (including opinions expressed on financial trading and other social media sites and online forums), the direct access of retail investors to broadly available trading platforms, the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock and any related hedging and other trading factors; and\n\u25cf based on the higher trading prices our shares have experienced recently, our market capitalization has recently reflected, and currently reflects, valuations that diverge significantly from those seen prior to these recent fluctuations, and to the extent these valuations reflect trading dynamics unrelated to our financial performance, prospects or the risks and uncertainties we face, purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses if there are declines in market prices driven by a return to earlier valuation levels.\nWe may continue to experience rapid and significant changes in our stock price and/or trading volume in the foreseeable future that may not coincide in timing with our disclosure of news or developments affecting us and our business. Accordingly, the market price of our shares of common stock may fluctuate dramatically, and may decline rapidly, regardless of any developments in our business. If the market price of our common stock declines and or trading volume is reduced, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them.\nThere are also a variety of other factors, some of which are beyond our control, that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock, including:\n\u25cf overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to that of our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our competitors or third parties;\n\u25cf changes in the anticipated size or growth rate of our addressable markets;\n\u25cf announcements of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital-raising activities or commitments, by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our actual or anticipated results of operations;\n\u25cf failure of revenues or earnings in any quarter to meet the investment community\u2019s expectations;\n\u25cf market conditions for telecommunications or cable industry stocks in general;\n\u25cf new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to us or our customers;\n\u25cf sales of significant amounts of our common stock by our officers and directors or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u25cf sales of significant amounts of our common stock by us or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u25cf health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza, and other highly communicable diseases; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism (including cyberterrorism), or responses to these events\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s stock, class action securities litigation has often been instituted against such companies. Litigation may arise out of facts and circumstances, or disclosure relating thereto, that we do not currently regard as material. Such volatility may entice stockholders to challenge our disclosure, whether or not they are correct. Any litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would interfere with our ability to execute our business plan and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American. If we are unable to comply with such requirements, our common stock would likely be delisted from the NYSE American, which would limit investors\u2019 ability to effect transactions in our common stock and subject our common stock to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common stock is currently listed on NYSE American. In order to maintain our listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of stockholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer for other reasons involving the judgment of NYSE American.\nOn December 10, 2021, the Company received written notification from NYSE American stating that the staff of NYSE Regulation has determined to commence proceedings to delist the common stock of the Company from the exchange. NYSE Regulation staff has determined that the Company is no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Section 1009(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d) as the Company was unable to demonstrate that it had regained compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Company Guide by the end of the maximum 18-month compliance plan period, which expired on December 10, 2021. We have appealed this determination; however, we cannot provide you with any assurances that we will be able to complete the necessary actions that would allow us to meet the stockholders\u2019 equity requirements in a timely manner or at all or that our appeal will be successful and that our common stock will remain listed and traded on NYSE American. We have been advised that our common stock will continue to trade on NYSE American during the pendency of our appeal; however, NYSE American has discretion to suspend trading in our common stock at any time if it believes suspension to be in the public interest. In addition, the Company may determine that it is not advisable to continue its appeal or maintain the listing of the common stock on NYSE American either before or following the completion of the appeal process.\nIf NYSE American delists our common stock from trading on the exchange or if we determine that it is not advisable to continue the appeal or maintain the listing of the common stock on NYSE American, we do not currently expect to attempt to have our common stock listed on another national securities exchange. In that event, we expect our common stock would qualify to be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could experience a number of adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf limited availability of market quotations for the common stock;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u25cf our common stock being categorized as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which requires brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; and\n\u25cf decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIn addition, the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 generally preempts the states from regulating the sale of \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Our common stock qualifies as \u201ccovered securities\u201d because the shares of common stock are listed on NYSE American. If our common stock were no longer listed on NYSE American, our securities would not be \u201ccovered securities\u201d and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.", "PERMNO": 82768, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "BDR"}
