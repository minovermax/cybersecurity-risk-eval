RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion sets forth material risk factors that could affect our financial condition and operations:\nIndustry Factors\nCommencing in 2008 and continuing for several years thereafter, the U.S. and global economies experienced a serious recession, slow economic recovery, persistent financial market volatility, and significant U.S. and global consumer and business economic deterioration which presented challenges for the banking and financial services industry and for MUAH. For the past several years, the U.S. economy has experienced a period of significant expansion; however, this expansion is not likely to continue indefinitely and, at some point, economic conditions in the U.S. are likely to soften or become recessionary with resultant adverse consequences for the U.S. financial services industry and for MUAH.\nFollowing the financial crisis of 2008, adverse financial and economic developments impacted U.S. and global economies and financial markets and presented challenges for the banking and financial services industry and for MUAH. These developments included a general recession both globally and in the U.S. followed by a slow economic recovery accompanied by unprecedented volatility in the financial markets.\nIn response, various significant economic and monetary stimulus measures were implemented by the U.S. government. The Federal Reserve pursued a highly accommodative monetary policy aimed at keeping interest rates at historically low levels although the Federal Reserve has more recently modified certain aspects of this policy by gradually increasing short-term interest rates and reducing its balance sheet. The U.S. economy has experienced a period of significant expansion in recent years; however, this expansion is not likely to continue indefinitely and, at some point, economic conditions in the U.S. are likely to soften or become recessionary. We, and other financial services companies, are impacted to a significant degree by current economic conditions.\nThe U.S. government continues to face significant fiscal and budgetary challenges which, if not resolved, could result in renewed adverse U.S. economic conditions. These challenges may be intensified over time if federal budget deficits were to increase and Congress and the Administration cannot effectively work to address them.\nIndeed, the overall level of the federal government's debt, the extensive political disagreements regarding the government's statutory debt limit and the continuing substantial federal budget deficits led to a downgrade from \u201cAAA\u201d to \u201cAA+\u201d of the long-term sovereign credit rating of United States debt by one credit rating agency, although other credit rating agencies did not take such action. This risk, and other risks associated with the divided control of the federal government, could be exacerbated over time. If substantial federal budget deficits were to continue in the years ahead, further downgrades by the credit rating agencies with respect to the obligations of the U.S. federal government could occur. Any such further downgrades could increase over time the U.S. federal government\u2019s cost of borrowing, which may worsen its fiscal challenges, as well as generate upward pressure on interest rates generally in the U.S. which could, in turn, have adverse consequences for borrowers and the level of business activity. Any such developments could also have adverse consequences for the securities business conducted by MUSA, which relies upon both the credit quality of bonds issued by the U.S. federal government and the smooth functioning of the markets using such bonds as collateral. It is also possible that the federal government\u2019s fiscal and budgetary challenges could be intensified over time as a result of the federal tax legislation signed into law in December of 2017 if the reductions in tax rates along with greater government spending result in increased federal budget deficits.\nDifficult market conditions have adversely affected the U.S. banking industry in the past and may do so again\nThe resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets following the 2008 recession adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations for several years after the recession. Although the economic conditions in our markets, including California in particular and in the U.S. in general, have significantly improved in recent years, there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue to improve, especially given the fact that the U.S. economic expansion is becoming extended in its duration. In addition, turbulent political and economic conditions in foreign countries and trade policy differences\nwith major U.S. trading partners may negatively impact the U.S. financial markets and economy in general. If these conditions worsen, market conditions could be adversely affected. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u2022\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties may be impaired if the methods and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite our customers and counterparties become less predictive of future behaviors.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to accurately estimate credit exposure losses because the process we use to estimate these losses requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments which may not be amenable to precise estimates, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans.\n\u2022\nOur ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.\n\u2022\nDowngrades in the credit ratings of major U.S. or foreign banks or other financial difficulties affecting such major banks could have adverse consequences for the financial markets generally, including possible negative effects on the available sources of market liquidity and increased pricing pressures in such markets which, in turn, could make it more difficult or expensive for banks generally and for us in particular to access such markets to satisfy liquidity needs.\n\u2022\nSignificant fluctuations in the prices of equity and fixed income securities could adversely impact the revenues of our broker-dealer and asset management and trust businesses. MUSA is exposed to the price risk of such securities where it holds inventory to meet expected customer demand. MUSA's debt capital markets fee income would also be detrimentally impacted from sustained periods of fixed income price volatility. MUB's fee income may also decline since its asset management and trust business fees are primarily based upon the values of assets it manages, and declines in the values of those assets proportionately reduce the amount of its fees charged.\n\u2022\nWe may incur goodwill impairment losses in future periods. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill Impairment Analysis\u201d in Part II, Item 7. and Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nThe United States, Mexico and Canada have come to an agreement to replace NAFTA with USMCA. Early in 2020, the U.S. Congress approved legislation implementing the USMCA and the President signed this legislation into law. Mexico had previously ratified the USMCA and Canada is expected to do so in the near future. The effect of this agreement and future proposals on international trade between the U.S. and other countries and on the level of economic activity in the U.S., as well as possible volatility in the financial markets generally, remains uncertain.\n\u2022\nChanges and uncertainties about U.S. and international trade relationships, agreements, policies, treaties and restrictive actions, as well as the possibility of significant increases in tariffs on imported goods and other restrictive actions, could have a material adverse impact on U.S., global and regional economic conditions and could result in volatility in the financial markets generally, among other impacts.\n\u2022\nGiven the inter-connectivity of the global economy, pandemic disease and health events, such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus infections originating in the Far East, have the potential to negatively impact economic activities in many countries, including the U.S., with consequent adverse effects on our customers and business.\nThe effects of changes or increases in, or supervisory enforcement of, banking, securities, competition or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal, monetary, or tax policies could adversely affect us or make strategic planning more difficult\nWe are subject to significant banking and federal and state securities regulation and supervision, which is primarily for the benefit and protection of our depositors and other customers and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole and less so for the benefit of investors in our securities. In the past, our business has been materially affected by these regulations. This can be expected to continue in the future. Laws, regulations or policies, including accounting standards and interpretations, currently affecting us and our subsidiaries may change over time. Regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of, and intensify their examination of compliance with, these statutes and regulations. Therefore, our business may be adversely affected by changes in laws, regulations, policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement, as well as by supervisory action or criminal proceedings taken as a result of perceived noncompliance, which could result in the imposition of significant penalties or fines. Changes in laws and regulations may also increase our expenses by imposing additional supervision, fees, taxes or restrictions on our operations. Compliance with laws and regulations, especially new laws and regulations, increases our operating expenses and may require additional management time and attention. To the extent state and local laws and regulations are not preempted by federal laws or regulations, our regulatory compliance could become more challenging.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010 in response to the financial crisis that culminated in the severe economic disruptions during and after 2008. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, established the CFPB with broad powers to regulate consumer financial products such as credit cards and mortgages, established the Financial Stability Oversight Council comprised of the heads of various regulatory agencies, led to new capital requirements from U.S. federal banking agencies, placed new limits on electronic debit card interchange fees, and required the SEC and national stock exchanges to adopt significant new corporate governance and executive compensation reforms. While the CFPB's regulatory powers have not changed under the current Administration, the number of publicly announced enforcement actions it has chosen to pursue has significantly declined.\nThis important legislation has affected U.S. financial institutions, including MUAH and MUB, in many ways, some of which have increased, or may increase in the future, the cost of doing business and present other challenges to the financial services industry. For additional information regarding the impact on our business of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations, see \"Supervision and Regulation - Principal Federal Banking Laws - Dodd-Frank Act and Related Regulations\" in Part I, Item 1. \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nFollowing the 2008 financial crisis and again during the past year, the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules making significant changes to the U.S. regulatory capital framework for banking organizations operating in the U.S., including our Company. For additional information, see \"Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Standards\" in Part I, Item I. \"Business\" and \"Regulatory Capital\" in Part II, Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in this Form 10-K.\nThe EGRRCPA, signed into law in May 2018, amended various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as other federal banking statutes as described more fully in \"Supervision and Regulation - Dodd Frank Act and Related Regulations\" in Part I, Item I. \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nThe need to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity under applicable bank regulatory agency rules could limit the Company\u2019s lending and other business activities and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in the Company taking steps to increase its capital or being limited in its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to its shareholders, or selling or refraining from acquiring assets. In addition, the regulatory liquidity standards could limit the Company\u2019s ability to invest in longer-term or less liquid assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective.\nThe capital rules of the U.S. federal banking agencies as well as the various other regulations referred to herein, along with other regulations which may be adopted in the future, may also generally increase our cost of doing business or lead us to stop, reduce or modify our products and services.\nProposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S. could also significantly affect our business. These proposals, among other things, include reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) in guaranteeing mortgages and providing funding for mortgage loans, as well as the\nimplementation of reforms relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the maximum size of a loan that the GSEs can guarantee, phasing in a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, improving underwriting standards, and increasing accountability and transparency in the securitization process. While the specific nature of these reforms and their impact on the financial services industry in general, and on MUB in particular, is uncertain at this time, such reforms, if enacted, are likely to have a substantial impact on the mortgage market and could potentially reduce our income from mortgage originations by increasing mortgage costs and/or lowering originations. The GSE reforms could also reduce real estate prices, which could reduce the value of collateral securing outstanding mortgage loans. This reduction of collateral value could negatively impact the value or perceived collectability of these mortgage loans and cause an increase in our allowance for loan losses. Such reforms may also include changes to the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which could adversely affect a significant source of funding for lending activities by the banking industry, including the Bank. These reforms may also result in higher interest rates on residential mortgage loans, thereby reducing demand, which could have an adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s residential mortgage lending business. In addition, any impact of such changes upon the credit quality of GSE\u2019s and therefore upon agency MBS securities held by MUAH could result in material reductions in valuations, as well as adverse impacts upon MUSA\u2019s agency MBS trading business.\nSeveral cities in the United States (including New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle) have adopted responsible banking ordinances and other cities are considering the adoption of similar ordinances. These ordinances generally require banks that hold city government deposits to provide detailed accounts of their lending practices in low-income communities, as well as their participation in foreclosure prevention and home loan principal reduction programs. Performance under these ordinances is used as a basis for awarding the city\u2019s financial services contracts. The adoption of these ordinances by municipalities for which the Bank is a provider of cash management or other banking services could result in increased regulatory and compliance costs and other operational costs and expenses, making this business less desirable to the Bank and potentially resulting in reduced opportunities for the Bank to provide these services. In August of 2015, New York City's ordinance was found to be invalid because it was pre-empted by federal and state banking laws and that case was dismissed. Whether and to what extent other responsible banking ordinances will be challenged and invalidated cannot be predicted.\nInternational laws, regulations and policies affecting us, our subsidiaries and the business we conduct may change over time and affect our business opportunities and competitiveness in these jurisdictions. Due to our ownership by MUFG and MUFG Bank, Ltd., laws, regulations, policies, fines and other supervisory actions adopted or enforced by the Government of Japan, the Federal Reserve and other regulators may adversely affect our activities and investments and those of our subsidiaries in the future.\nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Some legal and regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of criminal or civil penalties (which can be substantial) for noncompliance. In some cases, liability may attach even if the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even if reasonably designed compliance systems and procedures were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities and damage to our reputation. Legal or regulatory compliance failure may also adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for future strategic initiatives. Furthermore, failure to take necessary corrective action or the discovery of other violations of laws in the process of implementing any corrective measures could result in further regulatory enforcement action.\nOur business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and a long-standing policy of the Federal Reserve, a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. As a result of that policy, we may be required to commit financial and other resources to our subsidiary bank in circumstances where we might not otherwise do so. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve are (a) conducting open market operations in U.S. Government securities, (b) changing the discount rates on borrowings by depository institutions and the federal funds rate, and (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain deposits accepted by banks and borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The policies of the Federal Reserve can be expected to have a material effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information regarding the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policies on interest rates and\nour net interest margin, see \u201cFluctuations in interest rates on deposits or other funding sources could adversely affect our net interest margin\u201d below in this Risk Factors section.\nRefer to \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Part I, Item 1. \"Business\" in this Form 10-K for discussion of certain additional existing and proposed laws and regulations that may affect our business.\nIncreased regulation of the financial services industry has required and can be expected to continue to require significant investments in technology, personnel or other resources. Our competitors may be subject to different or reduced regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered and may also be able to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations and to more efficiently absorb increased regulatory compliance costs into their cost structures.\nThe December 2017 reform of the U.S. tax laws that included a substantial reduction in corporate and personal tax rates also changed the tax laws relevant to our business. While such reform has had and could continue to have positive effects on corporate profitability which could benefit the Company and its customers, there could be other potential adverse consequences such as a decrease in the value of tax credits on certain investments we may make. There could also be possible adverse consequences for the economy and the business climate, such as a large increase in the federal deficits and increasing interest rates generally, including for the federal government\u2019s borrowing costs. The potential long-run impact of these possible developments remains uncertain. For additional information regarding the possible effects of these changes on our business, see \u201cThe changes in the U.S. tax laws, the majority of which were effective January 1, 2018, will impact our business and results of operations in a variety of ways, some of which are expected to be positive and others which may be negative\u201d below in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nHigher credit losses could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses resulting in a charge to earnings\nWhen we loan money or commit to loan money, we incur credit risk or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio and our unfunded credit commitments. The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future impact of current economic conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans.\nWe might underestimate the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have credit losses in excess of the amount reserved. Or, we might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions, which we believe have caused losses to be sustained in our portfolio. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, borrowers with adjustable rate loans could see their payments increase. In the absence of offsetting factors such as increased economic activity and higher wages, this rate increase could reduce our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans, resulting in our increasing the allowance. We might also increase the allowance because of the occurrence of events previously unexpected. Any increase in our credit allowance would result in a charge to earnings.\nThe need to account for assets at market prices may adversely affect our results of operations\nWe report certain assets, including securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs and assumptions to estimate that value. Because generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. require fair value measurements to reflect appropriate adjustments for risks related to liquidity and the use of unobservable assumptions, we may recognize unrealized losses even if we believe that the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. During periods of adverse conditions in the capital markets, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments with respect to securities in our investment portfolio and such conditions could also result in mark-to-market losses in our trading portfolios at MUSA.\nFluctuations in interest rates on loans could adversely affect our business\nSignificant increases in market interest rates on loans or other fixed income investments, or the perception that an increase may occur, could adversely affect our current loan and investment portfolios, our ability to originate new loans and our ability to grow. An increase in market interest rates could adversely affect the ability of our floating-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations. If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs, which could adversely affect our business. Conversely, decreases in\ninterest rates could result in an acceleration of loan prepayments that could negatively affect our profitability. Increases in interest rates could also diminish the flow of corporate debt offerings in the securities markets generally and this could adversely impact the investment banking business of MUSA which is dependent on the sales of debt securities issued by its customers.\nFluctuations in interest rates on deposits or other funding sources could adversely affect our net interest margin\nChanges in market interest rates on deposits or other funding sources, including changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term market interest rates or between different interest rate indices, can impact, and has in past years impacted, our net interest margin (that is, the difference between the interest rates we charge on interest earning assets, such as loans, and the interest rates we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits or other borrowings). This impact could result in a decrease in our interest income relative to interest expense. Following the 2008 recession, the Federal Reserve\u2019s highly accommodative monetary policies (including a very low federal funds rate and substantial purchases of long-term U.S. Treasury and agency securities) placed downward pressure on the net interest margins of U.S. banks, including MUB. The Federal Reserve continued to gradually raise interest rates from late 2016 through 2018 and gradually reduce its historically high $4.5 trillion balance sheet until the third quarter of 2019 when the Federal Reserve again began to lower interest rates. The long-term impact of these measures on the U.S. economy and financial markets cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. For additional information, see \u201cThe effects of changes or increases in, or supervisory enforcement of, banking, securities, competition or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal, monetary, or tax policies could adversely affect us or make strategic planning more difficult\u201d above in this Risk Factors section. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1. \"Business - Supervision and Regulation - Principal Federal Banking Regulatory Agencies\" in this Form 10-K.\nOur deposit customers may pursue alternatives to bank deposits or seek higher yielding deposits, which may increase our funding costs and adversely affect our liquidity position\nChecking and savings account balances and other forms of deposits can decrease when our deposit customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, other non-depository investments or higher yielding deposits, as providing superior expected returns. Technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments or other deposit accounts, including products offered by other financial institutions or non-bank service providers. Future increases in short-term interest rates could increase such transfers of deposits to higher yielding deposits or other investments either with us or with other providers. Depositors may withdraw certain deposits from MUB and place them in other institutions or invest uninsured funds in investments perceived as being more secure, such as securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or collateralized debt obligations. These consumer preferences may force us to pay higher interest rates or reduce fees to retain certain deposits and may constrain liquidity as we seek to meet funding needs caused by reduced deposit levels.\nAs interest rates rise from the historically low levels of recent years, our deposits may not be as stable or as interest rate insensitive as similar deposits may have been in the past and, if the expansion of the U.S. economy continues, some existing or prospective deposit customers of banks generally, including MUB, may be inclined to pursue other investment alternatives.\nEfforts and initiatives we undertake to retain and increase deposits, including deposit pricing, can increase our costs. When bank customers move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments or into higher yielding deposits, we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, increasing our funding cost. As our assets grow, we may face increasing pressure to seek new deposits through expanded channels from new customers at unfavorable pricing, further increasing our costs.\nSubstantial competition could adversely affect us\nBanking is a highly competitive business. We compete actively for loan, deposit, and other financial services business in the West Coast states as well as nationally and internationally. Our competitors include a large number of state, community, regional and national banks, thrift institutions, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage banks and major foreign-affiliated or foreign banks, as well as many nonbank financial and nonfinancial firms that offer services similar to those offered by us, including many large securities firms and financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies. Some of our competitors are insurance companies\nor community or regional banks that have strong local market positions. While we are part of MUFG, one of the largest global financial institutions, MUAH, MUB and MUSA are separate entities from their parent and other affiliates, and our competition includes a number of large financial institutions and securities firms operating in our U.S. markets that have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources, which may be well in excess of ours. Competition in our industry may further intensify as a result of the recent and increasing level of consolidation of financial services companies, particularly in our principal markets resulting from various economic and market conditions. Larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost than ours, which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. In addition, some of our current commercial banking customers may seek alternative banking sources if they develop credit needs larger than we may be able to accommodate. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our activities and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Additionally, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and payment systems. We also experience competition, especially for deposits, from internet-based banking institutions and other financial companies, which do not always have a physical presence in our market footprint and have grown rapidly in recent years. Competition in our principal markets may further intensify as a result of provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which permit the establishment of new branches in states other than their home state by national banks, state banks and foreign banks to the same extent as banks located in the other states.\nThere are an increasing number of non-bank competitors providing financial services\nTechnology and other changes increasingly allow parties to complete financial transactions electronically, and in many cases, without banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds over the internet and by telephone or mobile devices without banks. In addition, so-called \u201cmarketplace lenders\u201d have been expanding their market share of consumer, mortgage and small business loans. Many non-bank financial service providers have lower overhead costs and are subject to fewer regulatory constraints and burdens. If consumers and small businesses do not use banks for their borrowings or to complete their financial transactions, we could potentially lose interest and fee income, deposits and income generated from those deposits and other financial transactions.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or new interpretations of existing standards emerge as standard industry practice. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. For information regarding the change in accounting standards relating to the allowance for expected credit losses, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe continuing war on terrorism, overseas military conflicts, unrest and political developments in other countries and the U.S. could adversely affect U.S. and global economic conditions\nActs or threats of terrorism and actions taken by the U.S. or other governments as a result of such acts or threats and other international hostilities, as well as political unrest in various regions, including the Middle East, may result in a disruption of U.S. and global economic and financial conditions and increases in energy costs and could adversely affect business, economic and financial conditions in the U.S. and globally and in our principal markets. In addition, continuing global tensions may result in new and enhanced U.S. economic sanctions against other governments or entities which may increase our compliance costs under the regulations of OFAC and other federal or state agencies. Although to date we have not experienced an adverse impact on our business from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (known as \"Brexit\"), potential changes in the European Union may have negative consequences for the global and U.S. economies and for our customers.\nThe Far East, including the Korean peninsula, China and Japan, continues to be subject to political tensions and potential volatility. In the event these conditions were to worsen, there could be material adverse economic consequences for the region, including for Japan, where our parents, MUFG and MUFG Bank, Ltd., have a substantial portion of their assets and business. If MUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s business were to sustain seriously\nadverse conditions from such circumstances, this could adversely impact the ability of MUFG and MUFG Bank, Ltd. to support MUAH\u2019s business in the U.S.\nThe replacement of LIBOR could adversely impact our business and results of operations, and the value of certain financial instruments\nIn July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the process of setting LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. There are ongoing global efforts to establish alternatives to interbank offered rates (such as LIBOR). However, there is uncertainty regarding the scope of the ultimate acceptance of alternative reference rates, and the potential impact on rates and pricing and assets, liabilities and results of operations. If another reference rate does not achieve widespread acceptance as an alternative to LIBOR, there likely will be disruption in the financial markets which rely on the availability of a broadly accepted reference rate, and volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nThe replacement of LIBOR creates a broad range of risks and challenges (including financial, operational, legal, reputational, compliance and market risks) for the banking industry and could adversely impact our businesses and results of operations, and the value of certain financial instruments originated or held by the Company that use LIBOR as a reference rate. LIBOR is used as a reference rate for many of our transactions, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long term borrowings, which means that it is the base on which relevant interest rates are determined. The risks and challenges that may be created by the replacement of LIBOR will become clearer as replacement alternatives are developed. For additional information, see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Market Risk Management - LIBOR Transition\u201d in Part II, Item 7. in this Form 10-K.\nThere are ongoing efforts to establish an alternative reference rate. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (or SOFR) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is considered the most likely alternative reference rate suitable for replacing LIBOR, but issues remain with respect to its implementation. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. As a result, the scope of its ultimate acceptance and the impact on rates, pricing and the ability to manage risk, including through derivatives, remain uncertain. No other alternative rate is currently under wide consideration.\nEven if SOFR or another reference rate ultimately replaces LIBOR, risks and challenges will remain for us with respect to outstanding loans, derivatives or other instruments using LIBOR, which will need to be transitioned to a new reference rate that is unlikely to exactly mimic, or produce the economic equivalent of, LIBOR. Risks related to transitioning instruments to a new reference rate or to how LIBOR is calculated and its availability are likely to vary by asset class and contract and will require considerable effort and expense to renegotiate contracts for outstanding financial assets and liabilities and include impacts on the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, or amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into, and increase the risk of litigation.\nIn addition, prior to LIBOR\u2019s cessation, instruments that continue to refer to LIBOR may be impacted if there is a change in the availability or calculation of LIBOR. While we expect LIBOR to continue to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021, it is possible that LIBOR quotes will become unavailable prior to that point and that it may be discontinued. This could result, for example, if sufficient LIBOR panel banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. Discontinuation of LIBOR prior to that time may cause significant disruption to financial markets and have adverse consequences for market participants.\nThe value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR, the trading market for LIBOR-based securities and the Company\u2019s risk exposures could also be impacted upon LIBOR\u2019s discontinuance or if it is limited. If LIBOR becomes unavailable earlier than the end of 2021, the risks and consequences associated with transitioning to an alternative reference rate are likely to be accelerated and magnified due, in part, to the shorter time available for preparing for the transition.\nThe replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue and expenses associated with financial instruments tied to LIBOR, and the value of those financial instruments, and may have adverse tax or accounting impacts, and result in compliance, legal, operational and systems costs and risks, which, in turn, could adversely impact our businesses and results of operations.\nCompany Factors\nAdverse economic factors affecting certain industries we serve could adversely affect our business\nWe provide financing to businesses in a number of industries that may be particularly vulnerable to industry-specific economic factors that can adversely impact the performance of our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial credit portfolios. The commercial real estate industry in the U.S., and in California in particular, was adversely impacted by the post-2008 recessionary environment and lack of liquidity in the financial markets. The home building and mortgage industries in California also were especially adversely impacted by the deterioration in residential real estate markets. Our commercial and industrial credit portfolio, and the communications and media industry, the retail industry, and the energy industry in particular, were also adversely impacted by recessionary market conditions and other emerging developments that are disruptive to their customary business models. Volatility in fuel prices and energy costs could adversely affect businesses in several of these industries, while a prolonged slump in oil, natural gas and coal prices could have adverse consequences for some of our borrowers in the energy sector. Poor economic conditions and financial access for commercial real estate developers and homebuilders could adversely affect property values, resulting in higher nonperforming assets and charge-offs in this sector. MUSA provides financing through repurchase transactions to mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs) collateralized by U.S. agency-backed mortgages held by such trusts. MUSA also has established a trading business in U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities. A down-turn in the real estate sector in the U.S. could adversely impact the creditworthiness of these mortgage REITs, and could adversely impact MUSA\u2019s business and results of operations. Conditions remain uncertain in various industries and could produce elevated levels of charge-offs.\nStarting in 2018, federal tax legislation imposes various new limits on the ability of taxpayers to deduct on their federal income tax returns the interest they pay on residential mortgage loans, as well as their state and local property taxes. These changes could have negative consequences for residential market values in the states in which we operate which could, in turn, have adverse impacts on MUB\u2019s existing residential mortgage loan portfolio and on the volume of newly-originated residential mortgage loans in the future.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is related to residential real estate, especially in California. Increases in residential mortgage loan interest rates could have an adverse effect on our operations by depressing new mortgage loan originations, and could negatively impact our title and escrow deposit levels. California markets have experienced a strong recovery in home prices since the post-2008 housing market crisis; however, home price growth has begun to moderate and some fundamentals of the housing market have remained soft through the recovery. A renewed downturn could have an adverse effect on our operations and the quality of our real estate loan portfolio. These factors could adversely impact the quality of our residential construction and residential mortgage portfolios in various ways, including by decreasing the value of the collateral for our mortgage loans. These factors could also negatively affect the economy in general and thereby our overall loan portfolio.\nChanges to the operating framework or functioning of the market in mortgage securities sponsored by the GSE\u2019s could also have an adverse impact on our exposure to mortgage-backed assets in both our banking and securities businesses. For additional information, see \u201cThe effects of changes or increases in, or supervisory enforcement of, bank, securities, competition or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal, monetary, or tax policies could adversely affect us or make strategic planning more difficult\u201d above in these Risk Factors.\nIndustry-specific risks are beyond our control and could adversely affect our loan portfolio, potentially resulting in an increase in nonperforming loans or charge-offs and a slowing of growth or reduction in our loan portfolio.\nAdverse California economic conditions could adversely affect our business\nA substantial majority of our assets, deposits and interest and fee income is generated in California. As a result, poor economic conditions in California may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio.\nAt times in past years, economic conditions in California have been subject to various challenges, including significant deterioration in the residential real estate sector and the California state government\u2019s budgetary and fiscal difficulties. While California home prices and the California economy in general have experienced a recovery in recent years, there can be no assurance that the recovery will continue. Recent growth in home prices in some California markets may be unsustainable relative to market fundamentals and home price declines may occur.\nIn addition, although the State of California has historically experienced budget shortfalls or deficits, during the past several years, California\u2019s budgetary situation has improved considerably (with a budget surplus being forecast for the coming year by the nonpartisan legislative analyst). However, there can be no assurance that the state\u2019s fiscal and budgetary challenges will not recur. Also, municipalities and other governmental units within California have experienced budgetary difficulties and several California municipalities have filed for protection under the Bankruptcy Code. As a result, concerns also have arisen regarding the outlook for the governmental obligations of California municipalities and other governmental units. If the budgetary and fiscal difficulties of the California state government and California municipalities and other governmental units were to recur or economic conditions in California decline, we expect that our level of problem assets could increase and our prospects for growth could be impaired.\nFor a number of years in the past decade, California has experienced severe drought, wildfires or other natural disasters. It can be expected that these events will continue to occur from time to time in the areas served by the Bank, and that the consequences of these natural disasters, including programs of public utility public safety power outages when weather conditions and fire danger warrant, may adversely affect the Bank\u2019s business and that of its customers. It is also possible that climate change may be increasing the severity or frequency of adverse weather conditions, thus increasing the impact of these types of natural disasters on our business and that of our customers.\nOur stockholder votes are controlled by MUFG Bank, Ltd. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.\nMUFG Bank, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MUFG, and MUFG own all of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG can elect all of our directors and can control the vote on all matters, including: approval of mergers or other business combinations; a sale of all or substantially all of our assets; issuance of any additional common stock or other equity or debt securities; incurring debt other than in the ordinary course of business; the selection and tenure of our Chief Executive Officer; payment of dividends with respect to our common stock or other equity securities; and other matters that might be favorable to MUFG Bank, Ltd. or MUFG.\nA majority of our directors are independent of MUFG and MUFG Bank, Ltd. and are not officers or employees of MUAH or any of our affiliates, including MUFG or MUFG Bank, Ltd. However, because of MUFG\u2019s and MUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s control over the election of our directors, they could at any time change the composition of our Board of Directors so that the Board would not have a majority of independent directors.\nMUFG Bank, Ltd.'s and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group\u2019s credit ratings and financial or regulatory condition could adversely affect our operations\nA substantial part of our operations has been historically funded independently of MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG, and we believe our business is not necessarily closely related to the business or outlook of MUFG Bank, Ltd. or MUFG. Although we make an effort to diversify our sources of liquidity, we are required to maintain a minimum of TLAC-eligible debt because of our affiliation with MUFG Bank, Ltd. If MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG\u2019s credit ratings, financial condition or business prospects were to decline, this could adversely affect our credit rating or harm our reputation or perceived creditworthiness. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nMUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG are also subject to regulatory oversight, review and supervisory action (which can include fines or penalties) by Japanese, U.S. and other regulatory authorities. Our business operations and expansion plans could be negatively affected by regulatory concerns or supervisory action any such authority might take against MUFG Bank, Ltd. or MUFG. For example, in connection with its annual BSA/AML and OFAC examination of MUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s U.S. based branches, in February 2019, the OCC imposed a public enforcement action upon MUFG Bank Ltd.\u2019s New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago branches. The enforcement\naction relates to the BSA/AML portion of the examination, is in the form of a consent order and requires MUFG Bank Ltd. and its U.S. branches to implement various remedial measures to address the deficiencies found in the examination, including the adoption of a comprehensive action plan satisfactory to the OCC, implementation of measures to ensure effective compliance management and qualified staffing, the adoption of comprehensive BSA/AML risk assessment policies and procedures and other remedial actions. MUB is not a party to the consent order.\nIn November 2017, MUFG Bank, Ltd. applied to the OCC to convert its state-licensed branches and agencies in the U.S. to federal branches and agencies and the OCC approved those conversion applications. As a result, these branches and agencies are now supervised by the OCC and are no longer supervised by state regulatory authorities. As a condition of the OCC\u2019s approval of the conversion applications, the OCC required MUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s primary New York branch to enter into a consent order with the OCC that supersedes and contains nearly identical substantive requirements as the historic 2013 and 2014 consent agreements with the NY DFS pertaining to compliance with OFAC sanctions. MUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s remediation efforts under the OCC consent orders are ongoing. The OCC and MUFG Bank, Ltd. have established an ongoing regulatory relationship and the nature of that relationship will continue to evolve over time.\nImmediately following the OCC\u2019s approval of the conversion applications, the NY DFS issued an order which, among other things, asserted that the NY DFS continued to have regulatory authority over MUFG Bank, Ltd. MUFG Bank filed suit on November 8, 2017, captioned The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. v. Maria Vullo, 17-cv-08691, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking a declaration that the NY DFS had no such continuing authority over MUFG Bank, Ltd. In response, DFS filed counterclaims against MUFG Bank, Ltd. In June 2019, MUFG Bank, Ltd. entered into a settlement with the NY DFS to resolve this litigation. Under the terms of the settlement, the NY DFS has released all of its claims against MUFG Bank, Ltd. and will not challenge the validity of the licenses issued by the OCC to MUFG Bank Ltd. In return, and in consideration of the impact of prolonged litigation, MUFG Bank Ltd. has released all of its claims against the NY DFS and agreed to make a $33 million settlement payment. This settlement resolves the pending federal civil litigation in its entirety and does not constitute a regulatory order or involve a monetary penalty.\nMUFG Bank, Ltd. and other inter-bank offered rate (IBOR) panel member banks have been named as defendants in a number of putative class and other legal proceedings in the United States relating to their actions as such and in some proceedings to their trading of financial instruments the prices of which can be affected by IBORs. Other somewhat similar proceedings have also named MUFG and MUSA along with MUFG Bank, Ltd. as defendants. MUFG Bank, Ltd. has also been named as a defendant in a number of civil lawsuits including putative class actions in the United States and Canada alleging foreign exchange market misconduct. While certain of these lawsuits have been settled without any admission of wrongdoing and there have been procedural and substantive developments favorable to MUFG affiliated defendants in others, it is currently not possible for us to predict the scope and ultimate outcome of these legal actions, including any possible effect on us as an affiliate of MUFG.\nPotential conflicts of interest with MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG could adversely affect us\nThe views of MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG regarding customer relationships, possible new businesses, strategies, acquisitions, divestitures or other initiatives, including compliance and risk management processes, may differ from ours. This may prevent, delay or hinder us from pursuing individual initiatives or cause us to incur additional costs and subject us to additional oversight. Our securities broker-dealer subsidiary, MUSA, receives a significant portion of its investment banking business from referrals from MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG and their affiliated entities. If such referrals were to diminish, this could have a materially adverse impact on the business of MUSA.\nAlso, as part of MUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s risk management processes, MUFG Bank, Ltd. manages global credit and other types of exposures and concentrations on an aggregate basis, including exposures and concentrations at MUAH or its subsidiaries. Therefore, at certain levels or in certain circumstances, our ability to approve certain credits or other banking transactions and categories of customers is subject to the concurrence of MUFG Bank, Ltd. We may wish to extend credit or furnish other banking services to the same customers as MUFG Bank, Ltd. Our ability to do so may be limited for various reasons, including MUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s aggregate exposure and marketing policies.\nSince MUB, MUSA, MUAH and MUFG Bank, Ltd. all compete in U.S. banking or investment banking markets, ownership interests in MUFG\u2019s common stock held by certain of our directors or officers, or services provided by those individuals as a director or officer or other employee of MUFG Bank, Ltd., could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest. In addition, a number of the executive officers of MUAH and MUB also serve as executive officers of MUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s U.S. branch operations, which could increase or appear to increase the risks of potential conflicts of interests with MUFG and MUFG Bank, Ltd. While the corporate governance policies adopted by MUAH, MUB, MUSA, MUFG and MUFG Bank, Ltd. address such potential conflicts of interest, there can be no assurance that these policies will prevent conflicts of interest which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nRestrictions on dividends and other distributions could limit amounts payable to us\nAs a holding company, a portion of our cash flow may come from dividends our bank and non-bank subsidiaries pay to us. Various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our subsidiaries can pay to us without prior regulatory approval. Our securities broker-dealer subsidiary, MUSA, is also subject to regulatory net capital rules which limit its ability to pay dividends. In addition, if any of our subsidiaries were to liquidate, that subsidiary\u2019s creditors will be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of that subsidiary to satisfy their claims against it before we, as a holder of an equity interest in the subsidiary, will be entitled to receive any of the assets of the subsidiary.\nRisks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures, integrations or restructurings may adversely affect us\nWe have in the past sought, and may in the future seek, to expand our business by acquiring other businesses which we believe will enhance our business. We cannot predict the frequency, size or timing of our acquisitions, as this will depend on the availability of otherwise suitable prospective target opportunities at valuation levels we find attractive and the competition for such opportunities from other parties. There can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results related to: the total cost of integration; the retention of key personnel; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; continued growth; or the overall performance of the acquired company or combined entity. We also may encounter difficulties in obtaining required regulatory approvals due to operational limitations, regulatory restrictions on our own activities, or other reasons. Unexpected contingent liabilities can arise from the businesses we acquire. Acquisitions may also lead us to enter geographic and product markets in which we have limited or no direct experience. Further, the asset quality or other financial characteristics of a business or assets we may acquire may deteriorate after an acquisition closes, which could result in impairment or other expenses and charges which would reduce our operating results.\nIn addition, we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell or restructure one or more of them. Any divestitures or restructurings may result in significant expenses and write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and may involve additional risks, including difficulties in obtaining any required regulatory approvals, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees.\nWe may not be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered in connection with any acquisition, divestiture, integration or restructuring we might make.\nIncreasing regulation of data privacy could adversely affect our business\nLaws and regulations related to data privacy and data security are increasing, as Federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing the collection, processing, storage, use, and security of personal and confidential information. Further, these laws and regulations are aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes in some cases. Laws and regulations designed to protect the privacy and security of customer information apply to us and our subsidiaries. These laws limit the handling and sharing of data. Our business model relies, in part, upon cross-marketing the products and services offered by us and our subsidiaries to our customers. Laws that restrict our ability to share information about customers between our affiliated companies or impose additional compliance costs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional discussion, see \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1. \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 or other such laws could result in increased operating expenses as well as additional exposure to the risk of litigation by or on behalf of customers\nIn June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d). This new law became effective on January 1, 2020 and provides consumers with expansive rights and control over their personal information which is obtained by or shared with \u201ccovered businesses\u201d (which includes MUB and most other banking institutions subject to California law). The CCPA gives consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions, the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer\u2019s personal information and the right not to be discriminated against because of choices regarding the consumer\u2019s personal information.\nThe CCPA provides for certain monetary penalties and for its enforcement by the California Attorney General or consumers whose rights under the law are not observed. It also provides for damages as well as injunctive or declaratory relief if there has been unauthorized access, theft or disclosure of personal information due to failure to implement reasonable security procedures. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including a provision to the effect that the CCPA does not apply where the information is collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA if the GLBA is in conflict with the CCPA. The impact of the CCPA on the business of MUB is yet to be determined, but it could result in increased operating expenses as well as additional exposure to the risk of litigation by or on behalf of consumers. It is possible that other states where we have customers could enact similar laws. For additional information, see \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Banks - Privacy\u201d in Part I, Item 1. \"Business\" in this Form 10-K.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to attract, develop, retain and successfully integrate skilled personnel\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel, including executives. Any of our current employees, including our senior management, may terminate their employment with us at any time. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry can be intense. We may not be successful in attracting, developing and retaining sufficient qualified personnel. We may also incur increased expenses and be required to divert the attention of other senior executives to recruit replacements for the loss of any key or other personnel.\nFrom time to time, we experience turnover among members of management, often due to retirement or rotation to other assignments within the MUFG group. We must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we bring into the organization in order to achieve our operating objectives as new management becomes familiar with our business.\nWe regularly encounter the need to effectively deal with technological change to maintain and enhance our competitive position; our current technological and other operational initiatives may strain our available resources\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change which regularly involves the introduction of new products and services based on new or enhanced technologies. Examples include cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, biometric authentication and data protection enhancements, as well as increased online and mobile device interaction with customers. We have been investing in technology to facilitate the ability of our customers to engage in financial transactions and for many other purposes, including our Transformation Program (see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview\u201d in Part II, Item 7. in this Form 10-K). Our continued success and the maintenance of our competitive position depends, in part, upon our ability to meet the needs of our customers through the application of new technologies. If we fail to maintain or enhance our competitive position with regard to technology, whether because we fail to anticipate customer needs and expectations or because our technological initiatives fail to perform as desired or are not timely implemented, we may lose market share or incur additional expense.\nIn addition to our technology-related programs and initiatives, there are a number of other operational and other initiatives which require our attention and resources. These include implementation of our Rewiring Program (see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview\u201d in Part II, Item 7. in this Form 10-K), adoption of amendments to U.S. Basel III capital and liquidity rules, impacts of CECL GAAP accounting standard change on regulatory reporting, and other enhanced\ncapital and liquidity guidelines, including the reforms to the Basel III agreement on bank capital standards finalized by the BCBS in December 2017 (\u201cBasel IV\u201d) but not yet applied by the U.S. federal banking agencies, various other regulatory initiatives, various strategic initiatives, and integration of new employees, including key members of management. Our ability to execute our core operations and to implement technology and other important initiatives may be adversely affected if our resources are insufficient or if we are unable to allocate available resources effectively.\nSignificant legal or regulatory proceedings could subject us to significant financial and reputational risks\nWe are from time to time subject to claims and proceedings related to our present or previous operations including claims by customers, our current or former employees and our contractual counterparties. These claims, which could include supervisory or enforcement actions by bank regulatory and other authorities, or criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities, could involve demands for large monetary amounts, including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities, and significant defense costs. Such claims also can divert the attention of senior management. We may be exposed to substantial liabilities which could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, reputation and financial condition. In the past several years, federal and state regulators have announced regulatory enforcement actions against a number of large BHCs and banks arising from deficiencies in processes, procedures and controls involving anti-money laundering measures and compliance with the economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others as provided for in the regulations of the OFAC of the U.S. Treasury Department. These actions evidence an intensification of U.S. federal and state governments\u2019 expectations for compliance with these regulatory frameworks on the part of banks operating in the U.S., including MUB, and may result in increased compliance costs and increased risks of regulatory sanctions.\nThe changes in the U.S. tax laws, the majority of which were effective January 1, 2018, will impact our business and results of operations in a variety of ways, some of which are expected to be positive and others which may be negative\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, enacted sweeping changes to the U.S. tax laws effective January 1, 2018. These changes can be expected to impact our business and results of operations in a variety of ways, some of which are expected to be positive and others which may be negative. Among changes which are expected to affect MUAH and its subsidiaries are the following.\n\u2022\nA reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, effective January 1, 2018. In general, we expect that this will result in a net reduction in annual income tax expense; however, our ability to currently utilize tax credits may be constrained by the lower tax rate. For example, we have invested in low-income housing and alternative energy investments that generate tax benefits and credits. The reduction of income tax expense reduces our ability to currently realize the tax credits generated by these investments.\n\u2022\nA new incremental base erosion and anti-abuse tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d) which is intended to tax certain outbound deductible payments made to related foreign affiliates. To the extent that the taxpayer\u2019s deductible payments to foreign affiliates exceed a specified threshold, the taxpayer will be subject to the BEAT minimum tax calculation. This minimum tax could apply to payments we make to our parent or other affiliates both within and outside of the U.S. We are presently analyzing the possible impact of this new tax on payments we may make to our affiliates.\nWe are continuing to monitor the full impact of these changes in the tax law on our tax positions which may not be fully known until interpretive guidance is issued by the IRS.\nFor additional information regarding the possible effects of the new federal tax laws on our business, see \u201cThe effects of changes or increases in, or supervisory enforcement of, banking, securities, competition, or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal, monetary or tax policies could adversely affect us or make strategic planning more difficult\u201d and \u201cAdverse economic factors affecting certain industries we serve could adversely affect our business\u201d above in this Risk Factors section.\nOur effective tax rates and our future results can also be affected by our participation for state income tax purposes as a member of MUFG\u2019s unitary group in the U.S. and by other factors\nUnder a tax election we have made, we are required to file our California franchise tax returns as a member of a unitary group that includes MUFG\u2019s U.S. operations, including its U.S. branches and other affiliates. Increases or decreases in the taxable profits of MUFG\u2019s U.S. operations could increase or decrease our effective tax rate for California state income tax purposes. We review MUFG\u2019s financial information on a quarterly basis to determine the rate at which to recognize our California income taxes. However, all of the information relevant to determining the effective California tax rate may not be available until after the end of the period to which the tax relates, primarily due to MUFG\u2019s March 31 fiscal year-end. Our California effective tax rate can change during the calendar year or between calendar years as additional information becomes available. We could be subject to penalties and interest if we understate our tax obligations. Our effective tax rates for both federal and state income tax purposes also could be affected by valuation changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretations and by the outcomes of examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities.\nOur credit ratings are important in order to maintain liquidity\nMajor credit rating agencies regularly evaluate and provide credit ratings of the securities of MUAH and the securities and deposits of MUB and also provide entity ratings for MUAH, MUB and MUSA. Their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt obligations and of our deposits and our entity ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength, ability to generate earnings, and other factors, some of which are not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy. In light of the continually evolving conditions in the financial services industry, the financial markets and the economy, changes to credit rating methodologies and the ongoing assessment of our current and expected satisfaction of various rating criteria, no assurance can be given that we will maintain our current ratings. If our long-term or short-term credit ratings suffer substantial downgrades, particularly if lowered below investment grade, such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds (especially our wholesale funding), trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of commercial depositors, investors and counterparties willing or permitted to lend to us, thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing our ability to generate income. For additional information, see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management\u201d in Part II, Item 7. of this Form 10-K.\nCertain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain a specified credit rating. If our credit rating were to fall below the specified rating, the counterparties to these derivative instruments could terminate the contract and demand immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization for those derivative instruments in net liability positions.\nAdverse changes in the credit ratings, operations or prospects of our parent companies, MUFG Bank, Ltd. and MUFG, could also adversely impact our credit ratings. For additional information, refer to the discussion above in these Risk Factors under the caption \u201cMUFG Bank Ltd.\u2019s and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group\u2019s credit ratings and financial or regulatory condition could adversely affect our operations\u201d.\nWe rely on third parties for important products and services\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and mutual fund distribution and, although we monitor their performance, we do not control their actions. Among other services provided by these vendors, third-party vendors have played and will continue to play a key role in the implementation of our technology enhancement and replacement projects, including our Transformation and Rewiring Programs. The federal banking agencies have issued enhanced guidance and are examining with increasing scrutiny financial institutions\u2019 diligence conducted on and oversight of their third-party vendors. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly or failing to meet legal and regulatory requirements, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, implement our technology enhancement and replacement projects or otherwise conduct our business and also could result in disputes with such vendors over the performance of their services to us, as well as adverse regulatory consequences for us. Replacing these third-party vendors on economically feasible terms may not always be possible or within our control and could also entail significant delay and expense.\nWe are subject to a wide array of operational risks, including, but not limited to, cyber-security risks\nWe are subject to many types of operational risks throughout our organization. Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events, that do not fall into the market risk or credit risk categories described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management\u201d in Part II, Item 7. of this Form 10-K. Operational risk includes execution risk related to operational initiatives, such as implementation of our technology enhancement and replacement projects, including our Transformation and Rewiring Programs, increased reliance on internally developed models for risk and finance management and compliance, including models associated with regulatory capital requirements, the pricing of various products, grading loans, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, and other activities and risks; risks from cyber-security breaches or attacks; the risk of fraud or theft by employees, customers or outsiders; unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems; and operational risks related to use of third party service providers. To the extent that any such models which we use are not correctly designed or are poorly implemented, our business could be at risk and information we furnish to the public or regulators could be rendered inaccurate or misleading, which, in turn, could have adverse consequences for our regulatory relations and public perceptions of our Company. A discussion of risks associated with regulatory compliance appears above in these Risk Factors under the caption \u201cThe effects of changes or increases in, or supervisory enforcement of, banking, securities, competition or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal, monetary, or tax policies could adversely affect us or make strategic planning more difficult.\u201d\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage, transmission and reporting of personal, confidential and other sensitive information or data in our computer systems, networks and business applications. Although we take protective measures, our computer systems, as well as the systems of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have significant negative consequences to us. Such events could result in interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or our customers\u2019 operations; interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information and data; or processing of unauthorized transactions or loss of funds. These events could result in litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered by our insurance or result in regulatory consequences or reputational harm, any of which could harm our competitive position, operating results and financial condition. We maintain cyber insurance, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with cyber incidents or the consequences of personal or confidential information being compromised. These types of incidents can remain undetected for extended periods of time, thereby increasing the associated risks. We may also be required to expend significant resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or exposures arising from cyber-security risks. We may also be required to expend significant resources to cover costs imposed on us as a result of breaches of bank card information occurring at retail merchants and other businesses.\nWe depend on the continued efficacy of our data management and governance policies, technical systems, operational infrastructure, relationships with third parties and our employees in our day-to-day and ongoing operations. Our increasing dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect or data which are not reliable. We are also exposed to the risk that, notwithstanding our data management and governance policies, data in our system may become corrupted, inaccurate or out-of-date, any of which can impair the integrity of our decision-making processes. With regard to the physical infrastructure that supports our operations, we have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any disruption to that infrastructure, including disruptions from natural disasters or other causes. Failures in our internal control or operational systems, security breaches or service interruptions, or those of our third-party service providers could impair our ability to operate our business and result in potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Although we carefully review the risk management standards and processes of our important third-party service providers, there can be no assurance that the risk management efforts of our providers will be successful in preventing all cyber incidents.\nMUB, and reportedly other financial institutions, have been the target of various denial-of-service or other cyber-attacks (including attempts to inject malicious code and viruses into computer systems) as part of\nwhat appears to be a coordinated effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions and potentially test their cyber-security in advance of future and more advanced cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks originate from a variety of sophisticated sources who may be involved with organized crime, linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries and have extensive resources to disrupt the operations of MUB or the financial system more generally. The potential for denial-of-service and other attacks requires substantial resources to defend and may affect customer satisfaction and behavior. To date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or information security breaches in the future. A successful cyber-attack could result in a material disruption of MUB\u2019s operations, exposure of confidential information and financial loss to MUB, its clients, customers and counterparties and could lead to significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions as well as reputational damage. While we have a variety of cyber-security measures in place, the consequences to our business of such attacks cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nIn addition, there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutions as well as at other types of companies, such as large retailers, or with respect to financial transactions, including through the use of social engineering schemes such as \u201cphishing.\u201d The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmissions of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches which would expose us to financial claims by customers or others and which could adversely affect our reputation and could lead to a material loss. Even if cyber-attacks and similar tactics are not directed specifically at MUB or our third-party service providers, such attacks on other large financial institutions could disrupt the overall functioning of the financial system and undermine consumer confidence in banks generally, to the detriment of other financial institutions, including MUB. For additional information regarding our obligations to provide for the security of our customers' data, see \"Supervision and Regulation - Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting Banks - Customer Information Security\" in this Form 10-K.\nWe, and other banking institutions, are also at risk of increased losses from fraudulent conduct of criminals using increasingly sophisticated techniques which, in some cases, are part of larger criminal organizations which allow them to be more effective. This criminal activity is taking many forms, including information theft, debit/credit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices affixed to ATM\u2019s, social engineering, phishing attacks to obtain personal information, or impersonation of customers through falsified or stolen credentials, business email compromise, and other criminal endeavors. We, and other banking institutions are also at risk of fraudulent or criminal activities by employees, contractors, vendors and others with whom we do business. There is also the risk of errors by our employees and others responsible for the systems and controls on which we depend and any resulting failures of these systems and controls could significantly harm our Company, including customer remediation costs, regulatory fines and penalties, litigation or enforcement actions, or limitations on our business activities.\nUnder the applicable Federal regulatory guidance, financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate the identity of customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. In addition, the financial institution\u2019s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution\u2019s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive or other malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. A financial institution which fails to observe this regulatory guidance could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.\nThe Federal bank regulators have also issued a cyber-security assessment tool, the output of which can assist a financial institution\u2019s senior management and board of directors in assessing the institution\u2019s cyber-security risk and preparedness. The first part of the assessment tool generates an inherent risk profile, which assists management in determining an institution\u2019s level of cyber-security risk. The second part of the assessment tool evaluates cyber-security maturity, which is designed to help management assess whether their controls provide the desired level of preparedness. The Federal bank regulators utilize the assessment tool as part of their examination process when evaluating financial institutions\u2019 cyber-security preparedness in information technology and safety and soundness examinations and inspections. Failure to effectively utilize this tool could result in regulatory criticism. Significant resources are required to adequately implement the tool and address\nany assessment concerns regarding preparedness. Management performs an annual cyber-security assessment using this tool to facilitate the identification and remediation of any concerns regarding our cyber-security preparedness.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from other events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as outages related to electrical, internet or telecommunications or other key supporting third party service providers, natural disasters (such as major seismic events or wildfires), terrorist attacks or unexpected difficulties with the implementation of our technology enhancement and replacement projects, which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability in ways which cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our business recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruptions of our operations.\nThe risks associated with cyber-security are also increasing due to the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our business and revenues\nAs a financial institution, our business and revenues are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. The reputation of the financial services industry in general has been damaged as a result of the financial crisis and other matters affecting the financial services industry, including mortgage foreclosure issues. Negative public opinion about us could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including our lending practices, the failure of any product or service we provide to meet our customers\u2019 expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, governmental enforcement actions, corporate governance deficiencies, business acquisitions, use of social media, cyber-security breaches or from actions taken by regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion could also result from regulatory concerns or supervisory or other governmental actions in the U.S. or Japan with respect to MUB, MUSA, MUFG Bank, Ltd. or MUFG. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep, attract and retain lending, deposit and other customers and employees and can expose us to claims and litigation and regulatory actions and increased liquidity risk. Actual or alleged misconduct by one of our businesses can result in negative public opinion about our other businesses.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the Company\nOur risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage and mitigate our risk exposure. Types of risk to which we are subject include liquidity risk, credit risk, market and investment risk, interest rate risk, operational risk (including, but not limited to, information and model risk), legal risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, fiduciary risk, counterparty risk and strategic risk (including risks to our financial position and resilience arising from adverse business decisions or poorly implemented decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry changes and the operating environment), among others. Our framework to manage risk, including the framework\u2019s underlying assumptions, such as our modeling methodologies, may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances. In the banking industry\u2019s complex and rapidly evolving operating environment, certain risks, especially operational risk and strategic risk, can present significant challenges to our risk management framework. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected and there also could be consequent adverse regulatory implications in any such event.\nEffective July 1, 2016, MUAH became the IHC for MUFG Bank, Ltd.\u2019s operations in the U.S. (other than its branches, agencies and other offices) and became subject to enhanced risk management and governance standards. These enhanced prudential standards, as well as the addition of the securities business of MUSA and other businesses to the Company, could continue to pose challenges for our risk management and governance oversight functions, including new customer relationships and lines of business, structural and operational changes, and enhanced governance and risk management standards to which we are subject.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe may be adversely affected by the poor condition of other financial institutions\nAs a result of trading, clearing or other relationships, we have exposure to many different counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers, dealers and investment banks. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by such a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be readily liquidated or can only be liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nOur financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include allowance for credit losses, transfer pricing, goodwill impairment analysis and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in deciding these matters, we may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase or decrease the allowance for credit losses; sustain loan losses that are significantly different than the reserve provided; recognize significant impairment on goodwill; or significantly increase or decrease our accrued tax liability. Any one or more of these actions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 20694, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "0176A"}
