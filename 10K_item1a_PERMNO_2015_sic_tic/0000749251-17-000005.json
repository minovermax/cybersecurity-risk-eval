{"cik": "749251", "company": "GARTNER INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions and trends. The following sections discuss many, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance, but is not intended to be all-inclusive. Any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and negatively affect your investment.\nRisks related to our proposed merger with CEB Inc.\nWe may not complete the proposed transaction with CEB within the timeframe we anticipate or at all, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations. On January 5, 2017, we announced together with CEB Inc. (NYSE: CEB) (\"CEB\") that we entered into a definitive agreement whereby we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of CEB in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $2.6 billion. We will also assume and refinance approximately $0.9 billion of CEB debt. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies. Closing of the transaction is subject to the approval of CEB shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The transaction is also subject to other risks and uncertainties, such as the possibility that CEB could receive an unsolicited proposal from a third party or that either we or CEB could exercise our respective termination rights. If the transaction is not consummated or is materially delayed for any reason, we will have spent considerable time and resources, and incurred substantial costs related to the merger, many of which must be paid even if the merger is not consummated. We cannot provide any assurance that the transaction will be consummated, that there will not be a delay in the consummation of the merger, or that all or any of the anticipated benefits and cost synergies of the transaction will be obtained. If the merger is not consummated, our reputation in our industry and in the investment community could be damaged, and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe may not be able to obtain our preferred form of financing to consummate the merger, and the terms of the financing may be less favorable to us than expected, depending on market conditions. There is no financing condition under the merger agreement, which means that if the conditions to closing are otherwise satisfied or waived, we are obligated to consummate the merger whether or not we have sufficient funds to pay the consideration under the merger agreement. We currently intend to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration, repay and redeem certain outstanding indebtedness of CEB and its subsidiaries and pay related fees and expenses in connection with the merger using a combination of new term loans, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities (or, to extent such debt securities are not issued, borrowings under a high-yield bridge credit facility), borrowings under a 364-day credit facility, borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility, and cash on hand.\nAlthough we have obtained debt commitments from certain lenders in connection with our financing plan, such commitment is subject to a number of conditions and we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to close the financing as anticipated. In addition, although the debt commitment letter for the financing specifies a number of terms for the different facilities, we retain some exposure to changes in pricing and other terms based on market conditions at the time the financing is consummated, which could result in less favorable terms for the financing than expected. The terms of the expected issuance of debt securities are not committed, and the pricing and terms of such debt securities may be less favorable than expected. If terms for the debt financing are less favorable than expected, financing costs could increase, potentially significantly, and our financing or operating flexibility may be constrained. In addition, the short tenor of the 364-day credit facility, together with duration fees, pricing step-ups and other terms of the 364-day credit facility and high-yield bridge credit facility (if drawn), provide significant economic incentive for us to refinance those facilities, which could result in us accessing the market at a less favorable time than we would otherwise choose. If we cannot close on any element of our financing plan, we will need to pursue other financing options, which may result in less favorable financing terms that could increase costs and/or materially adversely affect the credit rating or financing and operating flexibility of the combined company.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated, we may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to CEB. These costs could require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes. If the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, we would be required to pay CEB a reverse termination fee of $125.0 million. If the merger agreement is terminated, we may decide to pay the termination fee from available cash that we would have otherwise used for general corporate purposes. For these and other reasons, a failed merger could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows, or the price per share of our common stock.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating our operations with CEB's and realizing the expected benefits of the transaction with CEB. The success of the transaction with CEB, if consummated, will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining with CEB in an efficient and effective manner. We may never realize these business opportunities and growth prospects. Further, our management might have its attention diverted while trying to integrate operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures. CEB will continue to operate independently of us until the consummation of the transaction. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third parties, or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and could harm our financial performance. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of CEB\u2019s business with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the proposed transaction, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks related to our business\nOur operating results could be negatively impacted by global economic conditions. Our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends, in the United States and abroad. Global economic growth, including in the United States, has been subdued in recent years and there is concern this trend will continue in 2017. Terrorist attacks around the world and significant political shifts, such as the change in U.S. political leadership, have added additional uncertainty and risks to the economic environment. These trends and conditions could negatively and materially affect future demand for our products and services in general, in certain geographic regions, or in particular industry sectors. Such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client retention, wallet retention and consulting utilization rates, achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth, attract attendees and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients. Such developments could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services, including information available on the Internet free of charge. We also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers, including electronic and print media companies, some of which may have greater financial, information gathering and marketing resources than we do. These indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, low barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services. Additionally, technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures. Furthermore, we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis, timely delivery of information, customer service, and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis, or price.\nWe may not be able to maintain the quality of our existing products and services. We operate in a rapidly evolving market, and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our clients. Any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results. Further, if our published data, opinions or viewpoints prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research, our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline. In addition, we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a cost-effective manner via the Internet and mobile applications. Failure to maintain state of the art electronic delivery capabilities could materially adversely affect our future business and operating results.\nWe may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services, or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain competitive. The market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the IT industry as a whole. The development of new products is a complex and time-consuming process. Nonetheless, to maintain our competitive position, we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations, develop, enhance and improve our existing as well as new products and services to address those needs, deliver all products and services in a timely, user-friendly and state of the art manner, and appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of developing them. Any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Additionally,\nsignificant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nTechnology is rapidly evolving, and if we do not continue to develop new product and service offerings in response to these changes, our business could suffer. Disruptive technologies are rapidly changing the environment in which we, our clients, and our competitors operate. We will need to continue to respond to these changes by enhancing our product and service offerings in order to maintain our competitive position. However, we may not be successful in responding to these forces and enhance our products on a timely basis, and any enhancements we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of our clients. Our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new or enhanced existing offerings that address the changing needs of this constantly evolving marketplace. Failure to develop products that meet the needs of our clients in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nWe depend on renewals of subscription-based services and sales of new subscription-based services for a significant portion of our revenue, and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues. A large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscription-based research products and services and new sales of such products and services, both to new clients and existing clients. These products and services constituted approximately 75% and 73% of our total revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Generating new sales of our subscription-based products and services, both to new and existing clients, is a challenging, costly, and often time consuming process. If we are unable to generate new sales, due to competition or other factors, our revenues will be adversely affected.\nOur research subscription contracts are typically for 12-months or longer. Our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022\ndelivering high-quality and timely analysis and advice to our clients;\n\u2022\nunderstanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients; and\n\u2022\nproviding products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition.\nAdditionally, as we continue to adjust our products and service offerings to meet our clients\u2019 continuing needs, we may shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates. While our Research client retention rate was 84% at both December 31, 2016 and 2015, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals.\nWe depend on non-recurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues. Consulting segment revenues constituted 14% of our total revenues in 2016 and 15% in 2015. Consulting engagements typically are project-based and non-recurring. Our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022\ndelivering consistent, high-quality consulting services to our clients;\n\u2022\ntailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our clients; and\n\u2022\nour ability to match the skills and competencies of our consulting staff to the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential consulting engagements.\nAny material decline in our ability to replace consulting engagements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition. In addition, revenue from our contract optimization business can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is not predictable.\nThe profitability and success of our conferences, symposia and events could be adversely affected by external factors beyond our control. The market for desirable dates and locations for conferences, symposia and events is highly competitive. If we cannot secure desirable dates and suitable venues for our conferences, symposia and events their profitability could suffer, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations, the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control, such as labor strikes, transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions, economic slowdowns, reductions in government spending, geo-political crises, terrorist attacks, war, weather, natural disasters, communicable diseases, and other occurrences impacting the global, regional, or national economies, the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event. We also face the challenge of procuring venues that are sizeable enough at a reasonable cost to accommodate some of our major events.\nOur sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated. We derive significant revenues from research and consulting contracts with the United States government and its respective agencies, numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies, and foreign governments and their agencies. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately $355.0 million and $345.0 million, respectively, of our total contracts were attributable to government entities. Our U.S. government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the U.S. Congress to fund the agencies contracting for our services. Additionally, our contracts at the state and local levels, as well as foreign government contracts, are subject to various governmental authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms. In general, most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time without cause or penalty (\u201ctermination for convenience\u201d). Similarly, contracts with U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies are subject to increasingly complex bidding procedures, compliance requirements and intense competition. Should appropriations for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed, or should our government contracts be terminated for convenience, we may experience a significant loss of revenues.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize our future growth plans, as well as the quality of our products and services. Our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management, research analysts, consultants, sales and other key personnel. We face competition for qualified professionals from, among others, technology companies, market research firms, consulting firms, financial services companies and electronic and print media companies, some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals. Additionally, some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to non-compete agreements that could impede our short-term recruitment efforts. Any inability to retain key personnel, or to hire and train additional qualified personnel to support the evolving needs of clients or the projected growth in our business, could materially adversely affect the quality of our products and services, as well as future business and operating results.\nWe may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name. We believe that our \u201cGartner\u201d brand, including our independence, is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases. We may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the Gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget, hire additional marketing and public relations personnel, and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty. If we fail to effectively promote and maintain the Gartner brand, or incur excessive expenses in doing so, our future business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur international operations expose us to a variety of operational and other risks which could negatively impact our future revenue and growth. We have clients in over 90 countries and a substantial amount of our revenue is earned outside of the United States. Our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities, including general political and economic conditions in each country, changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers, challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions. Furthermore, we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations. If any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis, or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent.\nOur business and operations may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically penetrated the economy. It is our policy to comply, and to require our local partners and those with whom we do business to comply, with all applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act, and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. Our business and reputation may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws.\nWe are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates from our international operations. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 42% and 41%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the United States. Revenues earned outside the U.S. are typically transacted in local currencies, which may fluctuate significantly against the U.S. dollar. While we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, our effective tax rate is increased as the U.S dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, which could impact our operating results.\nNatural disasters, terrorist acts, war, and other geo-political events could disrupt our business. We operate in numerous U.S. and international locations, and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe. A major weather event, earthquake, flood, drought, volcanic activity, disease, or other catastrophic natural disaster could significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, acts of civil unrest, failure of critical infrastructure, terrorism, armed conflict, war, and abrupt political change, as well as responses by various governments and the international community to such acts, can have a negative effect on our business. Such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales, impede delivery of our products and services to our clients, disrupt or shut down the Internet or other critical client-facing and business processes, impede the travel of our personnel and clients, dislocate our critical internal functions and personnel, and in general harm our ability to conduct normal business operations, any of which\ncan negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. Such events could also impact the timing and budget decisions of our clients, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nPrivacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and potential clients from using our products and services or attending our events. Concerns relating to global data privacy have the potential to damage our reputation and deter current and prospective clients from using our products and services or attending our events. In the ordinary course of our business and in accordance with applicable laws, we collect personal information (i) from our employees (ii) from the users of our products and services, including event attendees; and (iii) from prospective clients. We collect only basic personal information from our clients and prospects (name, email address, job title) and do not as a rule collect sensitive personal information like the social security numbers used in the United States. While we may collect credit card numbers on a limited basis from some clients to facilitate payment, we do not store such numbers. Even if unfounded, concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of this personal information or other data privacy related matters could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, because many of our products and services are web-based, the amount of data we store on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the disclosure of our users\u2019 personal data could seriously limit the consumption of our products and services and the attendance at our events, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business.\nIn addition, while we had been a Safe Harbor certified company for a number of years, and while we have implemented a company-wide privacy compliance program, regulatory authorities around the world continue to adopt new laws, regulations and penalties concerning data privacy. Most recently, the European Commission adopted the EU-US Privacy Shield framework (which, as of the date of this report, has undergone a number of legal challenges as to its validity), and the European Parliament formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) which will become effective in May 2018. We are closely monitoring these legal developments and are working towards timely GDPR compliance. In the meantime, Gartner will continue to maintain and rely upon our comprehensive global data privacy compliance program and robust processes to safeguard our associates\u2019 and clients' personal data. The interpretation and application of these laws in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere are often uncertain, inconsistent and ever changing. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data privacy practices. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nInternet and critical internal computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business. A significant portion of our business is conducted over the Internet and we rely heavily on computer systems to conduct our operations. Individuals, groups, and state-sponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our operations, our computer systems, our employees, and our customers. They may develop and deploy malicious software to gain access to our networks and attempt to steal confidential information, launch distributed denial of service attacks, or attempt other coordinated disruptions. These threats are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. A cyber-attack, widespread Internet failure or Internet access limitations, or disruption of our critical information technology systems through denial of service, viruses, or other events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales, impede delivery of our products and services to our clients, disrupt other critical client-facing or business processes, or dislocate our critical internal functions. Such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial results.\nWe take steps to secure our management information systems, including our computer systems, intranet, proprietary websites, email and other telecommunications and data networks, and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service providers prior to retaining their services. However, the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers may not be effective and our systems (and those of our outside service providers) may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, power loss, or other disruptive events. Our reputation, brand, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or other technology-related catastrophe, our operations are disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we are required to dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs as a result of these occurrences.\nWe may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers and equipment, to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites, and to deliver our products and services through emerging channels, such as mobile applications. However, any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products, services,\nand user experience, resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, potentially harming our financial condition and operating results.\nOur outstanding debt obligations could impact our financial condition or future operating results. We have a credit arrangement that provides for a five-year, $600.0 million term loan and a $1.2 billion secured five year revolving credit facility (the \u201c2016 Credit Agreement\u201d). The 2016 Credit Agreement was amended on January 20, 2017 to permit the acquisition of CEB and the incurrence of an additional $1.375 billion senior secured term loan B facility, a $300.0 million 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility and a senior unsecured high-yield bridge facility of up to $600.0 million (or the issuance of a corresponding amount of debt securities (the \"Notes\")) to finance, in part, the acquisition and repay certain debt of CEB, and to modify certain covenants (the \"First Amendment\"). In connection with financing the CEB acquisition, the Company has also received a commitment with respect to $600.0 million unsecured senior bridge facilities. The 2016 Credit Agreement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased, at our option and under certain conditions, by up to an additional $750.0 million in the aggregate plus additional amounts subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including a maximum secured leverage ratio. At December 31, 2016, we had a total of $700.0 million outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement.\nThe affirmative, negative and financial covenants of the 2016 Credit Agreement, as amended, as well as the covenants related to the Notes, by the First Amendment, could limit our future financial flexibility. Additionally, a failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement and the Notes, which would materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders and Noteholders. No assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so, or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained in the 2016 Credit Agreement. The associated debt service costs of these credit arrangements could impair our future operating results. The outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us, which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services, respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital.\nWe may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. We may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions, implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program, to repay indebtedness or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital, including acquisitions. If our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements, we may seek additional borrowings or issue debt. Prevailing credit and debt market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost, and, as a result, financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations.\nIf we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. Our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us. The laws of certain countries, particularly in emerging markets, do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Accordingly, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Additionally, there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights.\nOur employees are subject to non-compete agreements, non-solicitation agreements and assignment of invention agreements, to the extent permitted under applicable law. When the non-competition period expires, former employees may compete against us. If a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the non-competition period, we seek to enforce these non-compete provisions but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts.\nWe have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions and strategic investments, which could involve substantial risks. We have made and may continue to make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses that offer complementary products and services or otherwise support our growth objectives. The risks involved in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition, dilution of the interests of our current stockholders should we issue stock in the acquisition, decreased working capital, increased indebtedness, the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks, the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company, the inability to integrate the business of the acquired company, the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business, the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day to day business. The realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business. Additionally, we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating acquisitions.\nWe face risks related to litigation. We are, and in the future may be, subject to a variety of legal actions, such as employment, breach of contract, intellectual property-related, and business torts, including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets. Given the nature of our business, we are also subject to defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the information we publish. Regardless of the merits and despite vigorous efforts to defend any such claim can affect our reputation, and responding to any such claim could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements, royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms. If a claim is made against us which we cannot defend or resolve on reasonable terms, our business, brand, and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face risks related to taxation. We are a global company with clients in over 90 countries. A substantial amount of our earnings is generated outside of the United States and taxed at rates significantly less than the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate. Our effective tax rate, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates and, conversely, lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and/or by changes in tax laws or accounting principles and their interpretation by relevant authorities.\nAt the present time, the United States and other countries where we do business have either changed or are actively considering changes in their tax, accounting and other related laws. In the United States, proposed and other tax law changes, particularly those directed at taxing unremitted and future foreign earnings, could increase our effective tax rate. In 2014, Ireland modified its tax residency rules. While these changes are not effective until 2021 for many companies with Irish resident operations, including Gartner, the new rules could increase our effective tax rate at that future date. Likewise, during 2015, the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (\u201cOECD\u201d) released final reports on various actions items associated with its initiative to prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS). The future enactment by various governments of these and future OECD proposals could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business. These actual, potential, and other changes, both individually and collectively, could materially increase our effective tax rate and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, our tax filings for various years are subject to examination by domestic and international taxing authorities and, during the ordinary course of business, we are under audit by various tax authorities. Recent and future actions on the part of the OECD and various governments will likely result in increased scrutiny of our tax filings. Although we believe that our tax filings and related accruals are reasonable, the final resolution of tax audits may be materially different from what is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, particularly in major taxing jurisdictions including, but not limited to: the United States, Ireland, India, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan, and France.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $340.0 million of accumulated undistributed earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Under U.S. GAAP rules, no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the Company has the ability and intent to reinvest such funds overseas indefinitely. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our U.S. operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our U.S. operations. We intend to reinvest these earnings in our non-U.S. operations, except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax. As a result, the Company has not recognized income tax expense that could result from the remittance of these earnings. However, future events such as a change in our liquidity needs or U.S. tax laws could cause us to change our repatriation policy and decide to repatriate some or all of these undistributed earnings. As a result, we could be required to accrue additional taxes in the future which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations in future periods.\nOur corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We operate in a number of countries, including emerging markets, and as a result we are required to comply with numerous, and in many cases, changing international and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. As a result, we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws, employee training, annual affirmations, monitoring and enforcement. However, if any employee fails to comply with, or intentionally disregards, any of these laws, regulations or our policies, a range of liabilities could result for the employee and for the Company, including, but not limited to, significant penalties and fines, sanctions and/or litigation, and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing, any of which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nRisks related to our common stock\nOur operating results may fluctuate from period to period and/or the financial guidance we have given may not meet the expectations of investors, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. Our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors, including the timing of the execution of research contracts, the extent of completion of consulting engagements, the timing of symposia and other events, the amount of new business generated, the mix of domestic and international business, currency fluctuations, changes in market demand for our products and services, the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services, competition in our industry, the impact of our acquisitions, and general economic conditions. An inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow, and achieve our forecasts, may impact our operating and other activities. The potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. Furthermore, our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or the financial guidance we have previously provided. If this occurs, the price of our common stock could decline.\nOur stock price may be impacted by factors outside of our control and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid. The price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other factors, developments in the industries in which we do business, general economic conditions, general market conditions, geo-political events, changes in the nature and composition of our stockholder base, changes in securities analysts\u2019 recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative to securities analysts\u2019 expectations for any quarterly period, as well as other factors outside of our control including any and all factors that move the securities markets generally. These factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current stockholders, or the threat that substantial sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock. Furthermore, we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards which have the effect of adding shares of common stock into the public market. At the present time, we are executing against a board-approved share repurchase program to reduce the number of outstanding shares of our common stock. At December 31, 2016, approximately $1.1 billion remained available for share purchases under this program. No assurance can be given that we will continue these activities in the future when the program is completed, or in the event that the price of our common stock reaches levels at which repurchases are not accretive.\nFuture sales of our common stock from grants and awards could lower our stock price. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under our equity incentive plans was approximately 2.6 million shares (approximately 1.5 million of which have vested). In addition, at the present time, approximately 6.2 million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans. Shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable and have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), except for any shares held by affiliates (as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) which are subject to certain limitations. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock.\nInterests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours. To our knowledge, as of the date hereof, and based upon publicly-available SEC filings, three institutional investors each presently hold over 5% of our common stock. While no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding shares, these significant stockholders may be able, either individually or acting together, to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and sales or purchases of assets. In addition, in the event of a proposed acquisition of the Company by a third party, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us. Accordingly, the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders.\nOur anti-takeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. These provisions include: (i) the ability of our Board of Directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock; (ii) advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings; and (iii) the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law. These provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock.", "PERMNO": 87030, "SIC": 8700, "TIC": "IT"}
