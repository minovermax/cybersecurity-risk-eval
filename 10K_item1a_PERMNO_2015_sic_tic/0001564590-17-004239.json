{"cik": "1471261", "company": "Cobalt International Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, business prospects, stock price, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on us. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur substantial level of indebtedness, which may increase over time, could reduce our financial flexibility. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions in order to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nAs of March 1, 2017, we have $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) and $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of first lien and second lien senior secured notes (the \u201cSecured Notes\u201d and, together with the Convertible Notes, the \u201cNotes,\u201d) outstanding. We are restricted from incurring certain additional indebtedness pursuant to these debt instruments in the future. In addition to our debt obligations, we have a substantial amount of contractual commitments pursuant to our license and lease agreements, among other things. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022\na high level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for our development projects, exploration drilling program, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\na significant portion or all of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;\n\u2022\na high level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, such as the continued downturn in oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u2022\na high level of indebtedness may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness could prevent us from pursuing.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance and our ability to borrow or otherwise use money to service, repay or refinance our indebtedness. General economic conditions, risks associated with exploring for and producing oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nFactors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our equity securities or a refinancing of our indebtedness include financial market conditions, restrictive covenants in our existing debt agreements, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital. In particular, weakness in the financial markets or other financing sources due to continued depressed prices for oil and natural gas may delay or prevent us from accessing additional funding sources to refinance and/or service our existing indebtedness. Further, there may be a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if we are unable to consummate key operational transactions, including the sale of our working interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola and certain U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets. If any of these adverse conditions occur or continue, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such indebtedness. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements, our creditors could elect to declare some or all of our debt to be immediately due and payable, our\nsecured noteholders could elect to commence foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIn order to increase our liquidity to levels sufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we are currently considering a number of actions, including minimizing capital expenditures, considering asset sales, aggressively managing working capital and issuing new debt or equity. There can be no assurance that sufficient liquidity can be raised from one or more of these transactions. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any of our strategies will yield sufficient funds to meet our liquidity needs, including for payments of interest and principal on our debt in the future, and any such alternative measures may be unsuccessful or may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations.\nWe may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have substantial debt obligations and our ongoing capital and operating expenditures will vastly exceed the revenue we expect to receive from our oil and natural gas operations in the near future. If we are unable to raise substantial additional funding or consummate significant asset sales on a timely basis and/or on acceptable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail our exploration, appraisal and development activities.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to, among other factors, our ability to monetize assets, our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing indebtedness, our ability to continue our cost cutting efforts, the production rates achieved from our discoveries, oil and natural gas prices, the number of commercially viable hydrocarbon discoveries made and the quantities of hydrocarbons discovered, the speed and cost with which we can bring such discoveries to production, whether and to what extent we invest in additional oil leases and concessional licenses, and the actual cost of exploration, appraisal and development of our prospects. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, no assurance can be given that any such funding, if obtained, will be adequate to meet our capital needs and support our growth. If additional funding cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, then our operations would be materially negatively impacted.\nIf we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may find it necessary to file a voluntary petition for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code in order to provide us additional time to identify an appropriate solution to our financial situation and implement a plan of reorganization aimed at improving our capital structure. For additional information, please see \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d contained herein.\nOur business plan requires substantial additional capital, which we may be unable to raise on acceptable terms in the future, which may in turn limit our ability to execute our development projects and achieve production, conduct exploration activities or renew our exploration portfolio.\nIn 2016, we generated $16.8 million of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. Our capital outlays and operating expenditures will increase substantially over at least the next several years as we expand our operations and will vastly exceed the revenue we receive from our oil and natural gas operations. Developing major offshore oil and natural gas projects, especially in complex and challenging environments, continuing exploration activities and obtaining additional leases or concessional licenses and seismic data are very expensive, and we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional capital, through future private or public equity offerings, asset sales, strategic alliances or debt or project financing. The recent significant and sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to consummate key divestments or acquisitions, including the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola;\n\u2022\nthe performance of the producing wells on our Heidelberg development;\n\u2022\nthe scope, rate of progress and cost of our exploration, appraisal and development activities;\n\u2022\nlack of partner participation in exploration, appraisal or development operations;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we invest in additional oil leases or concessional licenses;\n\u2022\noil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nour ability to locate and acquire hydrocarbon reserves;\n\u2022\nour ability to produce oil or natural gas from those reserves;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the timelines for development set forth in our leases;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any drilling and other production-related arrangements that we may enter into; and\n\u2022\nthe timing of partner and governmental approvals and/or concessions.\nOur business plan requires us to raise a substantial amount of capital. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, due to our substantial level of indebtedness, the restrictions in our indentures governing our Secured Notes, the continuing downturn in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise. Even if we succeed in selling additional securities to raise additional capital, at such time the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders could be diluted, and new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the financing may involve covenants similar to, or more restrictive than, those that govern our Secured Notes, that would restrict our business activities. If we choose to farmout interests in our leases or licenses, we would dilute our ownership interest subject to the farmout and any potential value resulting therefrom, and we may lose operating control over such leases or licenses.\nIn response to the continued decline in oil and natural gas prices, certain of our partners have announced significant capital expenditure reductions, which may cause such partners to elect not to participate in the drilling of a particular exploration or appraisal well with us. This could dramatically increase our share of the costs of such operation and may cause us to cancel or delay certain operations and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to consummate the sale of our Angolan assets on favorable terms, or at all.\nIn August 2016, the Agreement for the sale of our 40% working interest in each of Block 20 and Block 21 offshore Angola was automatically terminated pursuant to its terms. The Agreement provided that, upon termination of the Agreement, the parties are to be restituted in order to put them in their original positions as if no agreement had been executed. We are working with Sonangol to understand and agree on the financial and operational implications of the termination. We have requested that Sonangol extend certain deadlines for exploration and development milestones under our License Agreements. See \u201c-Under the terms of our various license agreements, we are required to drill wells, declare any discoveries and conduct certain development activities in order to retain exploration and production rights. Failure to do so may result in substantial license renewal costs or loss of our interests in these license areas.\u201d There can be no assurance that such extensions will be forthcoming, on favorable terms or at all. The failure to receive such extensions would have a material adverse effect on the value of these License Agreements.\nWe reserve the right to and will vigorously enforce the provisions of the Agreement if Sonangol does not grant the extensions we believe we are entitled to under the Agreement. The dispute resolution procedures of the Agreement require that any dispute be finally resolved under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, with proceedings seated in London, England. In addition, prior to commencing arbitration proceeding, a party must provide the other party with a Notice of Dispute describing the nature of the dispute and\nthe relief requested. Given Sonangol\u2019s delays and failure to date to grant the extensions, on March 8, 2017, we submitted such a Notice of Dispute to Sonangol under the Agreement. If Sonangol does not timely resolve this matter to our satisfaction, we intend to move forward with arbitration and at that time we will seek all available remedies at law or in equity.\nIn addition, discussions concerning the payment of certain joint interest receivables owed to us by an affiliate of Sonangol and the return of the first installments paid to us by Sonangol upon the execution of the Agreement are ongoing. Furthermore, the Angolan government passed Presidential Decree No. 212/15 which established a new Block 20/15 concession area covering our Lontra discovery. This decree ostensibly conflicts with our rights to develop oil from the Lontra discovery under the PSC. Accordingly, it is unclear what effect the passage of this decree has on our rights to develop Lontra under the PSC. There can be no assurance that we will be able to come to an agreement with Sonangol concerning these items on satisfactory terms or at all. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the value of our licenses and our ability to sell them. The inability to sell our Angolan assets to a third party on acceptable terms, or at all, or the failure to receive payment in full of the joint interest receivables owed to us, would each have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our ability to service and/or repay our substantial existing indebtedness.\nUnder the terms of our various license agreements, we are required to drill wells, declare any discoveries and conduct certain development activities in order to retain exploration and production rights. Failure to do so may result in substantial license renewal costs or loss of our interests in these license areas.\nIn order to protect our exploration and production rights in our license areas, we must meet various drilling and declaration requirements. In general, unless we make and declare discoveries within certain time periods specified in our various license agreements and leases, our interests in the undeveloped parts of our license (as is the case in Angola and Gabon) or the whole block (as is the case in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico) may lapse and we may be subject to significant penalties or be required to make additional payments in order to maintain such licenses.\nFurthermore, as required by our License Agreements, within thirty days following a successful exploration well, we are required to submit a declaration of commercial well to Sonangol. Within the earlier of (i) two years after the date of the declaration of commercial well or (ii) six months after the second appraisal well is drilled, we must submit a formal, declaration of commercial discovery to Sonangol. Within thirty days (in the case of Block 20) or 90 days (in the case of Block 21) from the declaration of commercial discovery, we are required to submit a development plan to Sonangol and the Angola Ministry of Petroleum for review and approval. Within 42 months after the formal declaration of commercial discovery, we are required to commence first production from such discovery. Our failure or inability to meet these deadlines could jeopardize our production rights or result in forfeiture of our production rights with respect to these projects, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nCertain drilling and declaration requirements will be very difficult to achieve with respect to our Cameia, Orca and Lontra discoveries and may require the need to renegotiate our License Agreements with Sonangol. Without the extensions we believe we are entitled to under the Agreement, the deadline to file a declaration of commercial discovery with respect to our Lontra discovery was in December 2015. Given the sale of our Angolan assets was pending at such time, we did not meet that deadline, although we requested an extension of this deadline from Sonangol and such extension was denied. Furthermore, Presidential Decree No. 212/15 was passed in December 2015 which established a new Block 20/15 concession area covering our Lontra discovery. It is unclear what effect the passage of this Presidential Decree has on our rights under the PSC with respect to our Lontra discovery. Presidential Decree Laws may need to be passed in Angola, along with the renegotiation of our PSC, in order to preserve our development rights with respect to Lontra. In light of (i) the apparent conflict between Presidential Decree No. 212/15 and our rights under the PSC and (ii) the denial of our request for an extension of the declaration of commercial discovery deadline with respect to Lontra, we impaired the value of our Lontra discovery in 2015.\nIn addition, most of our deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico blocks have a 10 year primary term, expiring between 2017 and 2025. Generally, we are required to commence exploration activities or successfully exploit our properties during the primary lease term in order for these leases to extend beyond the primary lease term. A portion of the leases covering our North Platte, Shenandoah and Anchor discoveries are beyond their primary term, and the operator must conduct continuous operations or obtain an SOP in order to maintain such leases. In addition, certain\nof our targeted exploration prospects have leases that expire within the next 12 months and even if we were to commence exploration activities prior to lease expiration, we could be required to conduct continuous operations on those prospects if the initial exploration activities were to be successful. This requirement to conduct continuous drilling operations may cause us to relinquish such leases despite the fact that an exploration well on such leases was successful. Accordingly, we and our partners may not be able to drill all of the prospects identified on our leases or licenses prior to the expiration of their respective terms and we can make no assurances that we, or the operator of the discoveries in which we hold a non-operated interest, will be able to successfully perpetuate leases through continuous operations or obtaining an SOP. Should the prospects we have identified under the licenses or leases currently in place yield discoveries, we cannot assure you that we will not face delays in drilling these prospects or otherwise have to relinquish these prospects. The costs to maintain licenses over such areas may fluctuate and may increase significantly since the original term, and we may not be able to renew or extend such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our actual drilling activities may therefore materially differ from our current expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For each of our lease and license areas, we cannot assure you that any renewals or extensions will be granted or whether any new agreements or leases will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or, in some cases, at all.\nA decline in prices for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe severe downturn in oil and natural gas prices over the last few years has had, and any future downturn will have, a significant material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and the market price of our common stock. The prices that we receive for our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production affects our revenues, profitability, liquidity, access to capital and future growth rate. Historically, prices for oil and natural gas have been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. These prices depend on numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control.\nThese factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nchanges in supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil futures contracts;\n\u2022\nglobal economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions, including embargoes, in oil-producing countries or affecting other oil-producing activities, particularly in the Middle East, Africa, Russia and South America;\n\u2022\nthe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the Middle East;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories and oil and natural gas refining capacities;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nproximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nSignificant declines in oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business:\n\u2022\nlimiting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance our capital expenditures and results of operations;\n\u2022\nreducing the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;\n\u2022\ncausing us to delay, postpone or terminate our exploration, appraisal and development activities;\n\u2022\nreducing any future revenues, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022\nreducing the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties; or\n\u2022\nlimiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.\nAny future substantial and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, the market price of our common stock results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nOur indentures governing the Secured Notes contain certain covenants that may inhibit our ability to make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our future goals or raise additional capital.\nOur indentures governing the Secured Notes include certain covenants that, among other things, restrict:\n\u2022\nour investments, loans and advances and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 payment of dividends and other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nour incurrence of additional secured indebtedness (including project finance indebtedness);\n\u2022\nthe granting of liens, other than liens created pursuant to the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes and certain permitted liens;\n\u2022\nmergers, consolidations and sales of all or a substantial part of our business or licenses; and\n\u2022\nthe sale of assets.\nAll of these restrictive covenants may limit our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies as well as raise additional capital to fund our business operations or service our debt obligations. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of our indentures governing the Secured Notes may be impacted by changes in economic or business conditions, our results of operations or events beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing the Secured Notes or the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, in which case, depending on the actions taken by the lenders thereunder or their successors or assignees, such lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under such indentures, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. If we were unable to repay such borrowings or interest, our lenders, successors or assignees under the Secured Notes could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness. If the indebtedness under our indentures governing the Secured Notes were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness. In addition, the limitations imposed by the indenture governing the Secured Notes on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nProvisions of our indentures governing the Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nCertain provisions of the indentures governing the Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us, or may even prevent a third party from acquiring us. For example, upon the occurrence of a \u201cchange of control\u201d (as defined in the indentures governing the Secured Notes) and a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the indentures governing the Convertible Notes), holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such notes in integral multiples of $1,000 at, in the case of the Secured Notes, a premium to the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, and in the case of the Convertible Notes, to the aggregate principal amount of such Notes (in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest). In addition, the acquisition of us by a third party could require us, under certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for our Convertible Notes for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such acquisition. By discouraging an acquisition of us by a third party, these provisions could have the effect of depriving the holders of our common stock of an opportunity to sell their common stock at a premium over prevailing market prices.\nFailure to effectively execute our appraisal and development projects could result in significant delays and/or cost overruns, including the delay of any future production, which could negatively impact our operating results, liquidity and financial position.\nAll of our appraisal and development projects are in the early stages of the project development life-cycle, except for our Heidelberg project. Our development projects and discoveries will require substantial additional evaluation and analysis, including appraisal drilling and the expenditure of substantial amounts of capital, prior to preparing a development plan and seeking formal project sanction. First production from these development projects and discoveries is not expected for several years, with the exception of our Heidelberg project which began producing oil and natural gas in 2016. All of our development projects and discoveries are located in challenging deepwater environments and, given the magnitude and scale of the initial discoveries, will entail significant technical and financial challenges, including extensive subsea tiebacks to production facilities, pressure maintenance systems, natural gas re-injection systems, and other specialized infrastructure. This may include the advancement of technology and equipment necessary to withstand the higher pressures associated with producing oil and natural gas from Inboard Lower Tertiary reservoirs.\nThis level of development activity and complexity requires significant effort from our management and technical personnel and places additional requirements on our financial resources and internal financial controls. In addition, we have increased dependency on third-party technology and service providers and other supply chain participants for these complex projects.\nWe may not be able to fully execute these projects due to:\n\u2022\nthe timing or occurrence of the closing of the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola;\n\u2022\npersistent low oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain sufficient and timely financing;\n\u2022\ninability to attract and/or retain sufficient quantity of personnel with the skills required to bring these complex projects to production on schedule and on budget;\n\u2022\nsignificant delays in delivery of essential items or performance of services, cost overruns, supplier insolvency, or other critical supply failure could adversely affect project development;\n\u2022\ninability to advance certain technologies;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain partner or government approval for projects;\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances, anti-development activities, legal challenges or other interruptions which could prevent access; and\n\u2022\ndrilling hazards or accidents or natural disasters.\nWe may not be able to compensate for, or fully mitigate, these risks.\nThe productivity of the Heidelberg field is uncertain.\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production from the Heidelberg field commenced in January 2016. Production rates from deepwater oil and natural gas developments may deviate substantially from expectations due to a variety of factors, including unforeseen geologic complexities, inability to maintain adequate pressures within the field reservoir, and failure or non-performance of key production equipment and infrastructure, including production facilities. Deepwater oil and natural gas developments are extremely complex and the downside risks to production levels are especially acute in the early stages of production. If we realize lower production rates than expected from Heidelberg, this may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe have limited proved reserves and areas that we decide to drill may not yield hydrocarbons in commercial quantities or quality, or at all.\nWe have limited proved reserves and our exploration portfolio consists of identified yet unproven exploration prospects based on available seismic and geological information that indicates the potential presence of hydrocarbons. The exploration, appraisal and development wells we drill may not yield hydrocarbons in commercial quantities or quality, or at all. In addition, while our exploration efforts are oil focused, any well we drill may discover natural gas or other hydrocarbons we may not have rights to develop or produce (such as in Angola). Even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. Undue reliance should not be placed on our limited drilling results or any estimates of the characteristics of our projects or prospects, including any derived calculations of our potential resources or reserves based on these limited results and estimates. Additional appraisal wells, other testing and production data from completed wells will be required to fully appraise our discoveries, to better estimate their characteristics and potential resources and reserves and to ultimately understand their commerciality and economic viability. Accordingly, we do not know how many of our development projects, discoveries or exploration prospects will contain hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities or quality to recover drilling and completion costs or to be economically viable. Even if hydrocarbons are found on our exploration prospects in commercial quantities, construction costs of oil pipelines, production platforms, facilities or subsea infrastructure, as applicable, and transportation costs may prevent such prospects from being economically viable. We will require various regulatory approvals in order to develop and produce from any of our discoveries, which may not be forthcoming or may be delayed.\nAdditionally, the analogies drawn by us from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not prove valid in respect of our drilling prospects. We may terminate our drilling program for a prospect if data, information, studies and previous reports indicate that the possible development of our prospect is not commercially viable and, therefore, does not merit further investment. If a significant number of our prospects do not prove to be successful, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo date, there has been limited exploration, appraisal and development drilling which has targeted the Inboard Lower Tertiary trend in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, an area in which we intend to focus a substantial amount of our exploration, appraisal and development efforts.\nOur discoveries and appraisal and development projects remain subject to varying degrees of additional evaluation, analysis and partner and regulatory approvals prior to official project sanction and production.\nOur use of the term \u201cdevelopment project\u201d refers to our existing discoveries upon which we have conducted appraisal or development drilling. Our use of the term \u201cdiscoveries\u201d refers to our existing discoveries and is not intended to refer to (i) our exploration portfolio as a whole, (ii) prospects where drilling activities have not discovered hydrocarbons or (iii) our undrilled exploration prospects. A discovery made by the initial exploratory well on a prospect does not ensure that we will ultimately develop or produce hydrocarbons from such prospect or that a development project will be economically viable or successful. Following a discovery by an initial exploratory well, substantial additional evaluation, analysis, expenditure of capital and partner and regulatory approvals will need to be performed and obtained prior to official project sanction and development, which may include (i) the drilling of appraisal wells, (ii) the evaluation and analysis of well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples and the results of production tests from both exploration and appraisal wells, and (iii) the preparation of a development plan which includes economic assumptions on future oil and natural gas prices, the costs of drilling development wells, and the construction or leasing of offshore production facilities and transportation infrastructure. Regulatory approvals are also required to proceed with certain development plans.\nAny of the foregoing steps of evaluation and analysis may render a particular development project uneconomic, and we may ultimately decide to abandon the project, despite the fact that the initial exploration well, or subsequent appraisal or development wells, discovered hydrocarbons and where we may have already made a significant investment. We may also decide to abandon a project based on forecasted oil and natural gas prices or the inability to obtain sufficient financing. We may not be successful in obtaining partner or regulatory approvals to develop a particular discovery, which could prevent us from proceeding with development and ultimately producing hydrocarbons from such discovery, even if we believe a development would be economically successful.\nOur proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates or assumptions underlying our reserves estimates could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.\nNumerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of our reserves. Our estimates of our net proved reserve quantities are based upon reports from NSAI, the independent petroleum engineering firm used by us. The process of estimating oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, and these reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions regarding future oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, production levels, and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling and production. Any significant variance in our assumptions and actual results could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows. In addition, our wells are characterized by low production rates per well. As a result, changes in future production costs assumptions could have a significant effect on our proved reserve quantities.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our estimated net proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated net proved reserves. We base the discounted future net cash flows from our estimated net proved reserves on average prices for the 12 month period preceding the date of the estimate. Actual prices received for production and actual costs of such production will be different than these assumptions, perhaps materially.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of our properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Any material inaccuracy in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\nWe are not, and may not be in the future, the operator of all our properties, and do not, and may not in the future, hold all of the working interests in our properties. Therefore, we will not be able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts, associated costs, or the rate of production of any non-operated and, to an extent, any non-wholly owned, assets.\nAs we do not operate our Heidelberg, Shenandoah and Anchor projects, we are subject to additional risks to our business and financial condition as the ultimate technical, operational and economic success of these projects will depend upon the efforts of the operators of the projects. The long-term success of our business will depend in part upon whether these projects are successful from a technical, operational and economic perspective, which we will have limited ability to control or influence as a non-operator.\nAs we carry out our exploration and development programs, we may enter into arrangements with respect to existing or future prospects that result in a greater proportion of our prospects being operated by others. In addition, the terms of our current or future licenses or leases may require at least the majority of working interests to approve certain actions. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of the prospects operated by our partners or which are not wholly-owned by us, as the case may be. Dependence on the operator or our partners could prevent us from realizing our target returns for those prospects. Further, it may be difficult for us to minimize the cycle time between discovery and initial production with respect to prospects for which we do not operate or wholly-own.\nThe success and timing of exploration and development activities operated by our partners will depend on a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022\npartner, government and regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nselection of technology; and\n\u2022\nthe rate of production of reserves, if any.\nThis limited ability to exercise control over the operations of some of our prospects may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDevelopment drilling may not result in commercially productive quantities of oil and natural gas reserves.\nOur exploration success has provided us with a number of major development projects on which we are moving forward. We must successfully execute our development projects, including development drilling, in order to generate future production and cash flow. However, development drilling is not always successful and the profitability of development projects may change over time.\nFor example, in new development projects available data may not allow us to completely know the extent of the reservoir or choose the best locations for drilling development wells. Therefore, a development well we drill may be a dry hole or result in noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Projects in frontier areas may require the development of special technology for development drilling or well completion and we may not have the knowledge or expertise in applying new technology. All costs of development drilling and other development activities are capitalized, even if the activities do not result in commercially productive quantities of hydrocarbon reserves. This puts a property at higher risk for future impairment if commodity prices decrease or operating or development costs increase.\nOur drilling and development plans are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter their occurrence or timing.\nOur drilling and development plans on our acreage are scheduled out over a multi-year period. Our drilling and development plans depend on a number of factors, including the availability of capital and equipment, qualified personnel, seasonal and weather conditions, regulatory and block partner approvals, civil and political conditions, oil prices, costs and drilling results. The final determination on whether to drill any exploration, appraisal, or development well, including the exact drilling location as well as the successful development of any discovery, will be dependent upon the factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as, to some degree, the results of our drilling activities. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified or targeted will be drilled in the location we currently anticipate, within our expected timeframe or at all or if we will be able to economically produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations.\nFurther, some of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico leases we own may benefit from unitization with adjacent leases, controlled by third parties. If these third parties are unwilling to unitize such leases with ours, this may necessitate our drilling additional, unforeseen wells to preserve our leases. Failure to drill these wells could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations. Our actual drilling and development plans and locations may be materially different from our current expectations which could have a material adverse effect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDrilling wells is speculative, often involving significant costs that may be more than our estimates, and may not result in any discoveries or additions to our future production or reserves. Any material inaccuracies in drilling costs, estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect our business.\nExploring for and developing oil reserves involves a high degree of operational and financial risk, which precludes definitive statements as to the time required and costs involved in reaching certain objectives. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing and operating exploration, appraisal and development wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise due to a tightening in the supply of various types of oilfield equipment and related services. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including geological conditions, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Exploration wells bear a much greater risk of financial loss than development wells. In the past we have experienced unsuccessful drilling efforts. Moreover, the successful drilling of an oil well does not necessarily result in a profit on investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well or an entire development project to become uneconomic or only marginally economic. Our initial drilling sites, and any potential additional sites that may be developed, require significant additional exploration and appraisal, regulatory approval and commitments of resources prior to commercial development. We face additional risks in the Inboard Lower Tertiary trend in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Gabon due to a general lack of infrastructure and, in the case of offshore Gabon, underdeveloped oil and natural gas industries and increased transportation expenses due to geographic remoteness. Thus, this may require either a single well to be exceptionally productive, or the existence of multiple successful wells, to allow for the development of a commercially viable field. If our actual drilling and development costs are significantly more than our estimated costs, we may not be able to continue our business operations as proposed and would be forced to modify our plan of operation.\nWe contract with third parties to conduct drilling and related services on our development projects and exploration prospects for us. Such third parties may not perform the services they provide us on schedule or within budget. The continued depression of oil and gas prices may have an adverse impact on certain third parties from which we contract drilling, development and related oilfield services, which in turn could affect such companies\u2019 ability to perform such services for us and result in delays to our exploration, appraisal and development activities. Furthermore, the drilling equipment, facilities and infrastructure owned and operated by the third parties we contract with is highly complex and subject to malfunction and breakdown. Any malfunctions or breakdowns may be outside our control and result in delays, which could be substantial. Any delays in our drilling campaign caused by equipment, facility or equipment malfunction or breakdown could materially increase our costs of drilling and cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe only recently began producing oil and natural gas and our future performance is uncertain.\nIn January 2016, we began producing oil and natural gas from our Heidelberg project in which we own just a 9.375% working interest. We do not currently produce oil or natural gas from any of our other properties and do not\nexpect to commence production from those properties for a significant amount of time. Production from our oil and natural gas properties will depend upon our ability to execute the appraisal and development of our projects and progress our projects through the project appraisal and development life-cycle, including the approval of development plans, obtaining formal project sanction, achieving successful appraisal and development drilling results and constructing or leasing production facilities and related subsea infrastructure. Our ability to commence production from our other properties will also depend upon us being able to obtain substantial additional capital funding on a timely basis and attract and retain adequate personnel. We have only been generating revenue from operations for a very short period of time and expect to generate only limited revenue from production for several years. Companies in their initial stages of development face substantial business and financial risks and may suffer significant losses. We have generated substantial net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since our inception and expect to continue to incur substantial net losses as we continue our project appraisal and development activities, our exploration drilling program and our new venture activities. We face challenges and uncertainties in financial and commercial planning as a result of the complex nature of our business and uncertainties regarding the nature, scope and results of our future activities and financial commitments. In the event that our appraisal, development or exploration drilling schedules are not completed, or are delayed, modified or terminated, there would be a material adverse effect on our operating results and our operations will differ materially from the activities described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of industry factors or factors relating specifically to us, we may have to change our methods of conducting business, which may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe inability of one or more third parties who contract with us to meet their obligations to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may be liable for certain costs if third parties who contract with us are unable to meet their commitments under such agreements. We are currently exposed to credit risk through joint interest receivables from our block and/or lease partners. As a result of our exploration success, we have a large inventory of development projects which will require significant capital expenditures and have long development cycle times. Our partners, both in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, must be able to fund their share of investment costs through the lengthy development cycle, through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities, or other sources, including project financing arrangements. Our partners may not be successful in obtaining such financing, which could negatively impact the progress and timeline for development. In addition to project development costs, our partners must also be able to fund their share of exploration and other operating expenses. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices over the past eighteen months may make it more difficult for our partners to meet their obligations to us under applicable joint operating and other agreements. We may be unable to recover such outstanding amounts, which would materially negatively impact our liquidity and financial position. Furthermore, in response to the recent decline in oil and natural gas prices, certain of our partners have announced significant capital expenditure reductions, which may cause such partners to elect not to participate in the drilling of a particular exploration or appraisal well with us. This could dramatically increase our share of the costs of such operation and may cause us to cancel or delay certain operations and there could be a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nIn addition, if any of the service providers we contract with to conduct development or exploration activities file for bankruptcy or are otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations to us, we may face increased costs and delays in locating replacement vendors. The recent severe decline in oil and natural gas prices and the resulting adverse impact on our industry may have an material adverse impact on or contribute to the insolvency of certain third parties from which we contract drilling, development and related oilfield services, as well as block partners, which in turn could affect such companies\u2019 ability to perform such services for us and result in delays to our exploration, appraisal and development activities. The inability or failure of third parties we contract with to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are dependent on certain members of our management and technical team and our inability to retain or recruit qualified personnel may impair our ability to grow our business.\nOur investors must rely upon the ability, expertise, judgment and discretion of our management and the success of our technical team in identifying, discovering and developing oil reserves and progressing our development projects toward first production. Our performance and success are dependent, in part, upon key members of our\nmanagement and technical team, and their loss or departure could be detrimental to our future success. Our inability to retain or recruit qualified personnel may impair our ability to grow our business and develop our discoveries, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to numerous risks inherent to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas.\nOil and natural gas exploration and production activities involve many risks that a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Our future success will depend on the success of our exploration and production activities and on the future existence of the infrastructure and technology that will allow us to take advantage of our findings. Additionally, our properties are located in deepwater, which generally increases the capital and operating costs, technical challenges and risks associated with exploration and production activities. As a result, our exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of seismic data through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations.\nFurthermore, the marketability of expected production from our prospects will also be affected by numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, market fluctuations of oil and natural gas prices, proximity, capacity and availability of pipelines, the availability of processing facilities, equipment availability and government regulations (including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of hydrocarbons, environmental, safety, health and climate change). The effect of these factors, individually or jointly, may result in us not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nWe are subject to drilling and other operational hazards.\nThe exploration and production business involves a variety of operating risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nblowouts, cratering and explosions;\n\u2022\nmechanical and equipment problems;\n\u2022\nuncontrolled flows or leaks of oil or well fluids, natural gas or other pollution;\n\u2022\nfires and natural gas flaring operations;\n\u2022\nmarine hazards with respect to offshore operations;\n\u2022\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022\npollution, other environmental risks and geological problems; and\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters.\nThese risks are particularly acute in deepwater drilling and exploration for natural resources. Any of these events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental damage, impairment of our operations, delays in our drilling operations, increased costs and substantial losses. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. We do not carry business interruption insurance. The occurrence of any of these events, whether or not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nWe are members of several industry groups that provide general and specific oil spill and well containment resources. Through these industry groups, as described under \u201cBusiness-Containment Resources\u201d, we have\ncontractual rights to access certain oil spill and well containment resources. We can make no assurance that these resources will perform as designed or be able to fully contain or cap any oil spill, blow-out or uncontrolled flow of hydrocarbons. Furthermore, our contracts for the use of oil spill and well containment resources contain strict indemnity provisions that generally require us to indemnify the contractor for all losses incurred as a result of assisting us in our oil spill and well containment efforts, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. In the event we experience a subsea blowout, explosion, fire, uncontrolled flow of hydrocarbons or any of the other operational risks identified above, the oil spill and well containment resources which we have contractual rights to will not prevent us from incurring losses or shield us from liability, which could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nOur operations involve special risks that could adversely affect operations.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt our operations. As a result, we could incur substantial expenses that could reduce or eliminate capital and funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions, or result in loss of equipment and properties.\nDeepwater exploration generally involves greater operational and financial risks than onshore exploration or exploration in shallow waters. Deepwater drilling generally requires more time and more advanced drilling technologies, involving a higher risk of technological failure and usually higher drilling costs. Such risks are particularly applicable to our deepwater exploration efforts in the Inboard Lower Tertiary trend. In addition, there may be production risks of which we are currently unaware. Whether we use existing pipeline infrastructure, participate in the development of new subsea infrastructure or use floating production systems to transport oil from producing wells, if any, these operations may require substantial time for installation, or encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in significant cost overruns and delays. Furthermore, deepwater operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico generally lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, a significant amount of time may elapse between a deepwater discovery and the marketing of the associated hydrocarbons, increasing both the financial and operational risk involved with these operations. Because of the lack and high cost of this infrastructure, oil and natural gas discoveries we make in the deepwater, if any, may never be economically producible.\nIn addition, in the event of a well control incident, containment and, potentially, cleanup activities for offshore drilling are costly. The resulting regulatory costs or penalties, and the results of third party lawsuits, as well as associated legal and support expenses, including costs to address negative publicity, could well exceed the actual costs of containment and cleanup. As a result, a well control incident could result in substantial liabilities for us, and have a significant negative impact on our earnings, cash flows, liquidity, financial position, and stock price.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by tropical storms and hurricanes.\nTropical storms, hurricanes and the threat of tropical storms and hurricanes often result in the shutdown of operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as well as operations within the actual and projected path of the tropical storms or hurricanes. In the future, during a shutdown period, we may be unable to access well sites and our services may be shut down. Additionally, tropical storms or hurricanes may cause evacuation of personnel and damage to offshore drilling rigs and other equipment, which may result in suspension of our operations. The shutdowns, related evacuations and damage can create unpredictability in activity and utilization rates, as well as delays and cost overruns, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nThe geographic concentration of our operations subjects us to an increased risk from factors specifically affecting those areas.\nOur operations are currently concentrated in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore West Africa in Angola. In addition, we have an interest in the Diaba Block offshore Gabon. Some or all of these properties could be affected should such regions experience:\n\u2022\nsevere weather or natural disasters;\n\u2022\nmoratoria on drilling or permitting delays;\n\u2022\ndelays in or the inability to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in production;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in the availability of drilling rigs and related equipment, facilities, personnel or services;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in the availability of capacity to transport, gather or process production; and/or\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory, political and fiscal environment.\nFor example, in response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010, the U.S. government and its regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over oil and natural gas exploration, including the DOI, BOEM and BSEE, imposed moratoria on drilling operations, required operators to reapply for exploration plans and drilling permits and adopted extensive new regulations, which effectively had halted drilling operations in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico for a period of time. Additionally, oil and natural gas properties and facilities located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico were significantly damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, which required our competitors to spend a significant amount of time and capital on inspections, repairs, debris removal, and the drilling of replacement wells. We maintain insurance coverage for only a portion of these risks. There also may be certain risks covered by insurance where the policy does not reimburse us for all of the costs related to a loss. We do not carry business interruption insurance.\nDue to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties.\nWe are subject to regulatory risk in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and regulations enacted over the past several years may have significantly increased certain of the risks we face and increased the cost of operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nIn 2010, the Transocean Deepwater Horizon, a semi-submersible offshore drilling rig operating in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, exploded, burned for two days and sank, resulting in loss of life, injuries and a large oil spill. The U.S. government and its regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over oil and natural gas exploration, including the DOI, BOEM and BSEE, responded to this incident by imposing moratoria on drilling operations and adopting numerous new regulations and new interpretations of existing regulations regarding operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Compliance with these new regulations and interpretations has increased the cost of our drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nIf we sell our Angolan assets, our business will be almost entirely focused on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The successful execution of our U.S. Gulf of Mexico business plan depends on our ability to continue our exploration and appraisal efforts. A prolonged suspension of or delay in our drilling operations would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations.\nIn April 2015, BSEE proposed new well control regulations, which include more stringent design requirements and operational procedures for critical well control equipment, including those aimed at improving equipment\nreliability, regulating drilling margin and preventing blowouts, as well as reforms in well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time well monitoring and subsea containment. Certain studies suggest that many wells drilled safely since 2010 could not be drilled as designed under the proposed regulations. If the rule were to be finalized as drafted, certain of our drilling operations may be delayed as required controls are implemented or may become infeasible or impossible due to the increased requirements.\nFurthermore, the Deepwater Horizon incident has increased and may further increase certain of the risks we face, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nincreased governmental regulation and enforcement of our and our industry\u2019s operations in a number of areas, including health and safety, financial responsibility, environmental, licensing, taxation, equipment specifications and inspections and training requirements;\n\u2022\nincreased difficulty in obtaining leases and permits to drill offshore wells, including as a result of any bans or moratoria placed on offshore drilling;\n\u2022\npotential legal challenges to the issuance of permits and the conducting of our operations;\n\u2022\nhigher drilling and operating costs;\n\u2022\nhigher royalty rates and fees on leases acquired in the future;\n\u2022\nhigher insurance costs, financial assurance requirements and increased potential liability thresholds under proposed legislation and regulations;\n\u2022\ndecreased partner participation in wells we operate;\n\u2022\nhigher capital costs as a result of any increase to the risks we or our industry face; and\n\u2022\nless favorable investor perception of the risk-adjusted benefits of deepwater offshore drilling.\nThe occurrence of any of these factors, or their continuation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations.\nWe face various risks associated with increased activism against oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.\nOpposition toward oil and natural gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the United States. Companies in the oil and natural gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations such as offshore drilling and development. For example, environmental activists have recently challenged lease sales, seismic acquisition activities and decisions to grant air quality permits in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for offshore drilling.\nFuture activist efforts could result in the following:\n\u2022\ndelay or denial of drilling permits;\n\u2022\nshortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size;\n\u2022\nrestrictions or delays on our ability to obtain additional seismic data;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on installation or operation of gathering, processing or production facilities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the use of certain operating practices;\n\u2022\nlegal challenges or lawsuits;\n\u2022\ndamaging publicity about us;\n\u2022\nincreased regulation;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of doing business;\n\u2022\nreduction in demand for our products; and\n\u2022\nother adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties.\nOur need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions in which we may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities. Thus, we face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or consultants, given that these parties may not always be subject to our control. Our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees and consultants may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.\nIn connection with entering into our RSAs for Blocks 9 and 21 offshore Angola, two Angolan-based E&P companies were assigned as part of the contractor group by the Angolan government. We had not worked with either of these companies in the past, and, therefore, our familiarity with these companies was limited. In 2010, we were made aware of allegations of a connection between senior Angolan government officials and one of these companies. In 2011, a formal order of investigation was issued by the SEC related to these allegations and, to avoid non-overlapping information requests, we voluntarily contacted the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) with respect to the SEC\u2019s investigation and offered to respond to any requests the DOJ may have.\nWe were notified in January 2015 that the SEC\u2019s investigation had concluded and that the SEC did not intend to recommend any enforcement action. In February 2017, we received a letter from the DOJ advising us that the DOJ has closed its investigation into our operations in Angola. This formally concluded the DOJ investigation and no regulatory action has been taken against us as a result of these investigations.\nOn March 13, 2017, the SEC informed us by telephone that it had initiated an informal inquiry regarding Cobalt related to the Sonangol Research and Technology Center (the \u201cTechnology Center\u201d). As background, on December 20, 2011, we executed the PSC under which we and BP are required to make certain social contributions to Sonangol, including for the Technology Center. On March 13, 2017, we also received a voluntary request for information regarding such inquiry. We believe our activities in Angola have complied with all applicable laws, including the FCPA, and we will cooperate with the SEC\u2019s inquiry.\nIn the future, we may be partnered with other companies with whom we are unfamiliar. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. There can\nbe no assurance that we will not become subject to additional investigations or inquiries by the SEC, DOJ or other governmental authorities in the future.\nA change in U.S. energy policy could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.\nU.S. energy policy and laws and regulations could change quickly, and substantial uncertainty exists about the nature of many potential rules and regulations that could impact the sources and uses of energy in the United States. For example, new CAFE standards enacted in 2012 have resulted in a significant increase in the fuel economy of cars and light trucks and have reduced the future demand for oil for road transport use. GHG emissions regulations may increase the demand for natural gas as fuel for power generation.\nWe design our exploration and development strategy and related capital investment programs years in advance. As a result, we are impacted in our ability to plan, invest and respond to potential changes in our business. This can result in a reduction of our cash flows and profitability to the extent we are unable to respond to sudden or significant changes in our operating environment due to changes in U.S. energy policy.\nOur need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a litigious environment.\nSome of the jurisdictions within which we operate have proven to be litigious environments. Oil and natural gas companies, such as us, can be involved in various legal proceedings, such as title, royalty, or contractual disputes, in the ordinary course of business.\nWe are currently, and from time to time we may become, involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. We intend to vigorously defend and prosecute any such lawsuits and do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, on March 8, 2017, we submitted a Notice of Dispute to Sonangol reserving our rights to file an arbitration proceeding under the Agreement if Sonangol does not timely resolve the matters relating to the extensions to our satisfaction. If it is not resolved to our satisfaction, we intend to move forward with arbitration and will seek all available remedies at law or in equity. However, we cannot predict the occurrence or outcome of these proceedings with certainty, and if we are unsuccessful in these litigations and any loss exceeds our available insurance, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBecause we maintain a diversified portfolio of assets that includes both U.S. and international projects, the complexity and types of legal proceedings with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. If we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flows. Legal proceedings could result in a substantial liability and/or negative publicity about us and adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by political and economic circumstances in the countries in which we operate.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities are subject to political and economic uncertainties (including but not limited to changes, sometimes frequent or marked, in energy policies or the personnel administering them), expropriation of property, cancellation or modification of contract rights, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, unilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities, redefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes, foreign exchange restrictions, currency fluctuations, royalty and tax increases and other risks arising out of governmental sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, as well as risks of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, acts of terrorism, piracy, disease, guerrilla activities, insurrection and other political risks, including tension and confrontations among\npolitical parties. Some of these risks may be higher in the developing countries in which we conduct our activities, namely, Angola and Gabon.\nOur operations are exposed to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may:\n\u2022\ndisrupt our operations;\n\u2022\nrestrict the movement of funds or limit repatriation of profits;\n\u2022\nin the case of our non-U.S. operations, lead to U.S. government or international sanctions; and\n\u2022\nlimit access to markets for periods of time.\nDisruptions may occur in the future, and losses caused by these disruptions may occur that will not be covered by insurance. Consequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be substantially affected by factors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute arising from non-U.S. operations, we may be subject to, or seek, the exclusive jurisdiction of courts or other tribunals outside the U.S. or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the U.S., which could adversely affect the outcome of such dispute.\nOur operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of jurisdictions, including Angola, Gabon, the United States, the Cayman Islands, Germany and other jurisdictions, or international treaties that affect foreign trade and taxation. Changes in any of these laws or policies or the implementation thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nThe oil and natural gas industry, including the acquisition of exploration acreage worldwide, is intensely competitive.\nThe international oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive in all aspects, including the exploration for, and the development of, new sources of oil and natural gas. We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring exploration acreage and hiring and retaining trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than us, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. These companies may be able to pay more for productive or prospective properties and prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Furthermore, these companies may also be better able to withstand the financial pressures of unsuccessful drill attempts, delays, sustained periods of volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry-wide economic conditions, and may be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional exploration prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for available capital for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to compete successfully in an intensely competitive industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nParticipants in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nExploration and production activities in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to extensive local, state, federal and international regulations. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations, particularly in respect of the following matters:\n\u2022\nlicenses and leases for drilling operations;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange and banking;\n\u2022\nroyalty increases, including retroactive claims;\n\u2022\ndrilling and development bonds and social payment obligations;\n\u2022\nreports concerning operations;\n\u2022\nthe spacing of wells;\n\u2022\nunitization of oil accumulations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental remediation or investigation; and\n\u2022\ntaxation.\nUnder these and other laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other types of damages for which we may not maintain, or otherwise be protected by, insurance coverage. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that could substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nFor example, in Angola we are subject to the Foreign Exchange Law for the Petroleum Sector, which requires, among other things, that all foreign exchange operations be carried out through Angolan banks, that oil and natural gas exploration and production companies open local bank accounts in foreign currencies in order to pay local taxes and to pay for goods and services supplied by non-resident suppliers and service providers, and also that oil and natural gas exploration and production companies open local bank accounts in local currency in order to pay for goods and services supplied by resident suppliers and service providers. See \u201cBusiness-Laws and Regulations of Angola and Gabon-Angola\u201d for more information. These new rules require additional compliance efforts and costs on our and other industry participants\u2019 part, and may in some cases cause delay or other issues in connection with the acquisition of or payments for goods and services. As a result of the significant downturn in oil and natural gas prices and recent devaluation of the Angola kwanza versus the U.S. dollar, it has become more difficult to conduct foreign currency transactions in Angola. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.\nWe periodically evaluate acquisitions of prospects and licenses, reserves and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. The successful acquisition of these assets requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nrecoverable reserves;\n\u2022\nfuture oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u2022\ndevelopment and operating costs; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental, safety, health and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject assets that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the assets to fully\nassess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental, safety, and health liabilities and could acquire assets on an \u201cas is\u201d basis. Significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve other risks, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nthe challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u2022\nthe challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nIf we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a significant acquisition, there may be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe success of a significant acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities from combining the acquired assets or operations with those of ours. Even if a combination is successful, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition or realize these benefits within the expected time frame. Anticipated benefits of an acquisition may be offset by operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices, increased interest expense associated with debt incurred or assumed in connection with the transaction, adverse changes in oil and natural gas industry conditions, or by risks and uncertainties relating to the exploration prospects of the combined assets or operations, or an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties, including the assumption of environmental, safety and health or other liabilities in connection with the acquisition. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from an acquisition, there may be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development, production and financial activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and to process and record financial and operating data.\nWe depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud application and services, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and for many other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The complexity of the technologies needed to explore for and develop oil and natural gas in increasingly difficult physical environments, such as below-salt deepwater, and global competition for oil and natural gas resources make certain information more attractive to thieves.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber-attacks, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for\npurposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial of service on websites.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations. Although to date we have not experienced any cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not be the target of cyber-attacks in the future or suffer such losses related to any cyber incident. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe and our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety regulations which are subject to change and may also result in material liabilities and costs.\nWe are, and our future operations will be, subject to various international, foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the emission and discharge of pollutants into the ground, air or water, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of regulated materials and the health and safety of our employees. We are required to obtain various environmental permits from governmental authorities for our operations, including drilling permits for our wells. There is a risk that we have not been or will not be at all times in complete compliance with these permits and the environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators, including through the revocation of our permits or the suspension or termination of our operations. If we fail to obtain permits in a timely manner or at all (due to opposition from community or environmental interest groups, governmental delays, changes in laws or the interpretation thereof or any other reasons), such failure could impede our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nWe, as the named lessee or as the designated operator under our current and future oil leases and licenses, could be held liable for all environmental, health and safety costs and liabilities arising out of our actions and omissions as well as those of our third-party contractors. To the extent we do not address these costs and liabilities or if we are otherwise in breach of our lease or license requirements, our leases or licenses could be suspended or terminated. We have contracted with and intend to continue to hire third parties to perform the majority of the drilling and other services related to our operations. There is a risk that we may contract with third parties with unsatisfactory environmental, health and safety records or that our contractors may be unwilling or unable to cover any losses associated with their acts and omissions. Accordingly, we could be held liable for all costs and liabilities arising out of the acts or omissions of our contractors, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs the designated operator of certain of our leases and licenses, we are required to maintain bonding or insurance coverage for certain risks relating to our operations, including environmental risks. We maintain insurance at levels that we believe are consistent with current industry practices, but we are not fully insured against all risks. Our insurance may not cover any or all environmental claims that might arise from our operations or those of our third-party contractors. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by our insurance, or our third-party contractors have not agreed to bear responsibility, such accident or event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to obtain required bonding or insurance coverage at all or in time to meet our anticipated startup schedule for each well, and if we fail to obtain this bonding or coverage, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nReleases to deepwater of regulated substances are common, and under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination caused by us or our contractors, at our facilities and at any third party waste disposal sites used by us or on our behalf. These costs could be material. In addition, offshore oil exploration and production involves various hazards, including human exposure to regulated substances,\nincluding naturally occurring radioactive materials. As such, we could be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances or other damage resulting from the release of regulated substances to the environment, endangered species, property or to natural resources.\nParticularly since the Deepwater Horizon event in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2010, there has been an increased interest in making regulation of deepwater oil and natural gas exploration and production more stringent in the U.S. If adopted, certain proposals such as a significant increase or elimination of financial liability caps for economic damages, could significantly raise daily penalties for infractions and require significantly more comprehensive financial assurance requirements under OPA which could affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nIn addition, we expect continued attention to climate change issues. Various countries and U.S. states and regions have agreed to regulate emissions of GHGs, including methane (a primary component of natural gas) and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of oil and natural gas combustion. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has in the past and may in the future consider legislation requiring reductions in GHG emissions. The EPA began regulating GHG emissions from certain stationary sources in January 2011 and attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements, but upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions, including from certain offshore oil and natural gas production facilities on an annual basis. In addition, in accordance with the CAP, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan in August 2015, which sets forth binding guidelines for GHG emissions from existing power plants, as well as rules relating to GHG emissions from new, modified and reconstructed power plants. The EPA is also required pursuant to a settlement agreement to issue GHG emissions standards for oil refineries, but no such standards have been proposed to date. The CAP also calls upon EPA and other governmental agencies to identify ways in which to reduce methane emissions from various sectors, including the oil and natural gas industry. In addition, in August 2015 the EPA proposed new regulations to reduce methane emissions from oil and natural gas operations in an effort to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by up to 45 percent by 2025. The EPA is also expected to expand the GHG Reporting Rule to cover all segments of the oil and natural gas industry. Additionally, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration administer GHG emissions standards for heavy, medium and light duty vehicles, which have become increasingly stringent over time. The regulation of GHGs and the physical impacts of climate change in the areas in which we, our customers and the end-users of our products operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the demand for our products.\nIt is unclear what impact the new administration may have on the aforementioned laws and regulations. To the extent that such laws or regulations are modified, the change could materially impact our business and operations.\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time. Our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from releases of, or exposure to, regulated substances may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. See \u201cBusiness-Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nNon-U.S. holders of our common stock, in certain situations, could be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock.\nOur assets consist primarily of interests in U.S. oil and natural gas properties (which constitute U.S. real property interests for purposes of determining whether we are a U.S. real property holding corporation) and interests in non-U.S. oil and natural gas properties, the relative values of which at any time may be uncertain and may fluctuate significantly over time. Therefore, we may be, now or at any time while a non-U.S. investor owns our common stock, a U.S. real property holding corporation. As a result, under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (\u201cFIRPTA\u201d), certain non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain from the disposition of shares of our common stock, in which case they would also be required to file U.S. tax returns with respect to such gain. Whether these FIRPTA provisions apply depends on the amount of our common stock that such non-U.S. investors hold and whether, at the time they dispose of their shares, our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market (such as the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d)) within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. So long as our common stock is listed on the NYSE, only a non-U.S. investor who\nhas held, actually or constructively, more than 5% of our common stock may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock under FIRPTA.\nWe may incur substantial losses and become subject to liability claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.\nSeveral external factors could arise which would significantly impact our ability to effectively insure our oil and natural gas exploration and development operations. Should legislation be passed to increase the minimum insurance limit of the OSFR policy required for future U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas exploration, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain this insurance. The insurance markets may not provide products to financially insure us against all operational risks. For instance, civil and criminal penalties for environmental pollution can be very severe and may not be insurable. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the market price of available insurance is excessive or prohibitive relative to the risks presented.\nEven when insurance is purchased, exclusions in coverage, unanticipated circumstances and potentially large indemnity obligations may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. The continuation of the recent severe declines in oil and natural gas prices has had a negative impact on the foreign currency exchange market for the Angola Kwanza, which in turn has made it more difficult for our insurance provider in Angola to obtain foreign currency in an amount sufficient to procure adequate re-insurance. The inability of our insurance provider to obtain adequate re-insurance may jeopardize our insurance coverage or otherwise impair its ability to perform its obligations under our insurance policies and agreements. Because third-party contractors and other service providers are used in our offshore operations, we may not realize the intended protections of worker\u2019s compensation laws in dealing with their employees. Generally, under our contracts with drilling and other oilfield service contractors, we are obligated, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, to indemnify such contractors for all claims arising out of damage to our property, injury or death to our employees and pollution emanating from the well-bore, including pollution resulting from blow-outs and uncontrolled flows of hydrocarbons.\nIn addition, even when insurance is purchased, we may encounter disputes with our insurance providers concerning coverage and such providers may attempt to deny coverage. For example, certain of our insurance providers are disputing coverage for certain expenses and potential liabilities, including with respect to our current shareholder litigation matters. We are enforcing our rights to coverage pursuant to our insurance agreements with these insurance providers and believe such expenses and potential liabilities are covered by such insurance, within certain thresholds. Should we be unsuccessful in enforcing rights under our insurance agreements, should we breach the terms of our insurance agreements or should such insurance agreements not provide the coverage we believed to be in place, any losses we incur which are not covered wholly or partially by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to pay a material cash sum to Whitton Petroleum Services Limited (\u201cWhitton\u201d) in connection with the closing of the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola.\nIn February 2009, we entered into a restated overriding royalty agreement (the \u201cRoyalty Agreement\u201d) with Whitton. Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty Agreement, in consideration for Whitton\u2019s consulting services in connection with Blocks 9, 20 and 21 offshore Angola and our business and operations in Angola, Whitton is to receive quarterly payments (measured in U.S. Dollars) equal to 2.5% of the market price of our share of the crude oil produced in such quarter and not used in petroleum operations, less the cost recovery crude oil, assuming the applicable government contract is a production sharing agreement. If the applicable government contract is a risk services agreement and not a production sharing agreement (which is the case with respect to Blocks 9 and 21), pursuant to the Royalty Agreement, we have undertaken to agree with Whitton an economic model (the \u201cRSA Economic Model\u201d) containing terms equivalent to those in such risk services agreement and using actual production and costs. The RSA Economic Model has not yet been agreed with Whitton. If we assign all of our interests in such blocks, or if we sell the company, Whitton may have the right to receive the market value of its rights and obligations under the Royalty Agreement, based upon the amount in cash a willing transferee of such rights and obligations would pay a willing transferor in an arm\u2019s length transaction. Given potential issues regarding how such market value of Whitton\u2019s rights and obligations under the Royalty Agreement could be calculated, including, without limitation, outstanding issues related to the RSA Economic Model, the amount of any such payment that\ncould be owed to Whitton upon consummation of any sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola is uncertain, but may be significant. Resolution of any such payment may include an expert determination of such cash value payment. We can make no assurance that any results from an expert determination process will be favorable to us. If we are ultimately required to pay a significant sum under the Royalty Agreement, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nConversions of the Convertible Notes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes are entitled to convert the notes at their option at any time up until the respective maturity dates. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nA requirement by such holders for us to repurchase some or all of such notes for cash will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including if we do not have sufficient funds or are otherwise unable to comply with such requirement in accordance with the indentures governing the Convertible Notes.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nWe are currently out of compliance with the New York Stock Exchange's (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) minimum share price requirement and are at risk of the NYSE delisting our common stock, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and liquidity and value of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE, and the continued listing of our common stock is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. On February 27, 2017, we were notified by the NYSE that we are no longer in compliance with the continued listing standards because the average closing price of our common stock had fallen below $1.00 per share over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. If we are unable to cure such non-compliance with the continued listing standards in the six-month period following such notice, the NYSE may commence suspension and delisting procedures. In addition, if our common stock price remains below the $1.00 per share threshold and the NYSE at any time considers the stock price to be \"abnormally low,\" the NYSE has the discretion to begin delisting procedures immediately, including during the six-month cure period.\nDuring the six-month cure period, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE, subject to compliance with the other NYSE continued listing standards. In order to cure such non-compliance during the cure period, we may elect to effect a reverse stock split, subject to and upon approval by our stockholders and our board of directors. At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, we intend to present to stockholders a proposal to authorize our Board Directors, in its sole discretion, to amend our certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio within the range of 1:5 to 1:15 (such ratio to be determined by the Board of Directors). There can be no assurance, however, that any reverse stock split will be approved or implemented on such terms or at all. Further, even if a reverse stock split is approved and successfully implemented, there can be no assurance that such action will directly or indirectly cure any non-compliance with NYSE continued listing standards.\nIn the event of a delisting, our common stock could be traded on the over-the-counter bulletin board, also known as the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d A delisting of our common stock could have a material adverse effect on us by, among other things:\n\u2022\nreducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nreducing the number of investors, including institutional investors, willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to issue additional securities, obtain additional financing or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions; and\n\u2022\nadversely impacting our reputation, including our relationship with business partners.\nIn addition to the minimum average closing price criteria, we would also be considered to be below compliance with the continued listing standards if our average market capitalization over a consecutive 30 day-trading period is less than $50 million and, at the same time, our stockholders\u2019 equity is less than $50 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had a stockholders\u2019 deficit of $841.3 million, and we were not in compliance with the stockholders\u2019 equity portion of such listing standard. Although we are currently in compliance with the $50 million average market capitalization requirement, continued deterioration of our stock price could result in us being out of compliance with such requirement. In addition, if our average global market capitalization over a consecutive thirty trading-day period is less than $15 million, the NYSE will promptly initiate suspension and delisting procedures and, under the NYSE\u2019s continued listing standards, we will not have any opportunity to regain compliance.\nThe failure of our common stock to be listed on any of The New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ Global Select Market or The NASDAQ Global Market would constitute a \"fundamental change\" under the terms of the indentures governing our Convertible Notes. In such case, we would be required to provide notice to the holders of our Convertible Notes of such fundamental change and could be required, at the option of the holders of our Convertible Notes, to repurchase for cash any such Convertible Notes following the date of the notice. A requirement by such holders for us to repurchase some or all of such notes for cash will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including if we do not have sufficient funds or are otherwise unable to comply with such requirement in accordance with the indentures governing our Convertible Notes.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe timing or occurrence of the closing of the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola;\n\u2022\nthe price of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe success of our development and production operations, and the marketing of any oil and natural gas we produce;\n\u2022\nto what extent our exploratory wells are successful;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries where we operate;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nquarterly or annual variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the industries in which we compete and issuance of new or changed securities;\n\u2022\nincreases in operating costs, including cost overruns associated with our exploration and development activities;\n\u2022\nanalysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u2022\nthe inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe issuance or sale of any additional securities of ours;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our company and of the industry in which we compete and areas in which we operate; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nA substantial portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market at any time. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nAll of the shares sold in our public offerings are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the federal securities laws, unless purchased by our \u201caffiliates\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Substantially all the remaining shares of common stock are restricted securities as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may be sold in the U.S. public market only if registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration, including by reason of Rules 144 or 701 under the Securities Act. All of our restricted shares are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in certain circumstances to the volume, manner of sale limitations with respect to shares held by our affiliates, and other limitations under Rule 144. Additionally, we have registered all shares of our common stock that we may issue under our employee and director benefit plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, unless pursuant to their terms these stock awards have transfer restrictions attached to them. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nConversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who have previously converted their notes.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock will be diluted if additional shares are issued.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, units and debt securities for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, repayment or refinancing of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions. We may issue additional shares of common stock in connection with complementary or strategic acquisitions of assets or businesses. We also issue restricted stock to our executive officers, employees and independent directors as part of their compensation. If we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our current outstanding stockholders.\nOwnership of our capital stock is concentrated among our largest stockholders and their affiliates.\nA small number of stockholders hold a majority of our common stock. These stockholders have influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that you may not view as beneficial. Furthermore, these stockholders may sell their shares of common stock at any time. Such sales could be substantial and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control.\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware statutes, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control. These provisions, including those providing for the possible issuance of shares of our preferred stock and the right of the board of directors to amend the bylaws, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire a substantial number of shares of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their shares of common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.", "PERMNO": 93152, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CIEIQ"}
