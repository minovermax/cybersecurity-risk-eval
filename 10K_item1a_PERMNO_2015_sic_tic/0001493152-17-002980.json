{"cik": "880984", "company": "ACORN ENERGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe may from time to time make written or oral statements that contain forward-looking information. However, our actual results may differ materially from our expectations, statements or projections. The following risks and uncertainties, together with other factors not presently determinable, could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, statements or projections.\nGENERAL FACTORS\nWe have a history of operating losses and have used significant amounts of cash for operations and to fund our acquisitions and investments.\nWe have a history of losses from our operating entities and corporate overhead, and have used significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities over the years. In 2016 and 2015, we had operating losses of $3.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively plus losses from discontinued operations of $0.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Cash used in operating activities of continuing operations in 2016 was $3.6 million while in 2015 operating activities of continuing operations provided $2.2 million. An additional $1.0 million and $3.2 million were used in the operating activities of discontinued operations in 2016 and 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had less than $100,000 of non-escrow corporate cash and cash equivalents and did not have sufficient cash flow for the next twelve months. In February 2017, we borrowed $900,000 from three of our directors and received a commitment from a director that would allow us to borrow up to an additional $1.0 million on or after July 7, 2017 under certain conditions (see Recent Developments). Such cash together with the expected October 2017 receipt of escrowed funds from the DSIT Transaction and reduced cash need from OmniMetrix based on their expected continued growth, is expected to finance our operations through at least the first quarter of 2018. The abovementioned director loans are due to be repaid at the earlier of April 30, 2018 or upon the sale of our remaining 41.2% interest DSIT which we are currently pursuing.\nBased on the above, we have sufficient cash to finance our operations for the next year. However, we may need to seek additional sources of funding if both of the following were to occur: (i) a failure by OmniMetrix to grow at the rate anticipated that necessitates additional funds for their operations, and (ii) the receipt of the escrowed funds from the DSIT sale is less than we anticipate. Additional sources of funding may include additional loans from related and/or non-related parties, a sale of our DSIT investment, a sale, partial sale or finding a strategic partner for OmniMetrix or equity financings. There can be no assurance additional funding will be available at acceptable terms or that we will be able to successfully utilize any of these possible sources to provide additional liquidity.\nWe depend on key management for the success of our business.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management team, including Jan Loeb, Benny Sela, Walter Czarnecki and Michael Barth. The loss of the services of any of these key managers could materially harm our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of these employees. We may also not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for our senior management if their services were no longer available.\nLoss of the services of a few key employees could harm our operations.\nWe depend on key technical employees and sales personnel. The loss of certain personnel could diminish our ability to develop and maintain relationships with customers and potential customers. The loss of certain technical personnel could harm our ability to meet development and implementation schedules. The loss of key sales personnel could have a negative effect on sales to certain current customers. Although most of our significant employees are bound by confidentiality and non-competition agreements, the enforceability of such agreements cannot be assured. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. If we fail to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future, our business could be disrupted.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be volatile\nOur common stock is approved for quotation on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol \u201cACFN.\u201d The OTCQB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter equity securities and provides significantly less liquidity than a listing on the NASDAQ Stock Markets or other national securities exchanges. The OTCQB securities are traded by a community of market makers that enter quotes and trade reports. This market is limited in comparison to the national stock exchanges and any prices quoted may not be a reliable indication of the value of our common stock. Quotes for stocks included on the OTCQB are not listed in the financial sections of newspapers as are those for the NASDAQ Stock Market or the NYSE. Therefore, prices for securities traded solely on the OTCQB may be difficult to obtain.\nTrading on the OTCQB marketplace as opposed to a national securities exchange has resulted and may continue to result in a reduction in some or all of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and our company:\n\u25cf the liquidity of our common stock;\n\u25cf the market price of shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations;\n\u25cf the number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf the number of market markers in shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of shares of our common stock; and\n\u25cf the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to:\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses;\n\u25cf announcements of new products or services by us;\n\u25cf fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u25cf significant sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; and\n\u25cf news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions.\nPenny stock rules will limit the ability of our stockholders to sell their stock\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d. The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.\nOur awards of stock options to employees may not have their intended effect.\nA portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel has historically included the award of options to buy our common stock or the common stock of our subsidiaries. If the price of our common stock performs poorly, such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel. In addition, any changes made to our stock option policies, or to any other of our compensation practices, which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and financial accounting standards may result in additional expenses and affect our reported results of operations.\nKeeping informed of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting standards, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank Act, as well as new and proposed SEC regulations and accounting standards, has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources. Compliance with such requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and an increased allocation of management time and attention to compliance activities.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate companies which we may invest in or acquire in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nPart of our business model includes the acquisition of new companies either as new platform companies or complimentary companies for our subsidiaries. Although we do not presently foresee making such acquisitions in the near term unless they support our existing businesses, if we did so, any failure to effectively integrate any future acquisition\u2019s management into our controls, systems and procedures could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur strategy is to continue to integrate any newly acquired companies and grow the businesses of all of our companies. Integrating acquisitions is often costly, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies with existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences. Integrating acquired companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, including:\n\u25cf failure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect;\n\u25cf inability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u25cf dilution of existing stockholders;\n\u25cf potential disruption of our ongoing business activities and distraction of our management;\n\u25cf difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired companies;\n\u25cf difficulties in coordinating and integrating overall business strategies, sales and marketing, and research and development efforts; and\n\u25cf difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including accounting controls and procedures.\nIn order to grow, one or more of our companies may decide to pursue growth through acquisitions, although we do not currently plan any significant acquisitions. Any significant acquisition by one or more of our operating companies could require substantial use of our capital and may require significant debt or equity financing. We anticipate the need to closely manage our cash for the foreseeable future and cannot provide any assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing or its effect on our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe incur substantial costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses in connection with our reporting requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Dodd-Frank Act and the rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. These rules and regulations have already increased our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time and effort we devote to compliance activities. We expect that as a result of continued compliance with these rules and regulations, we will continue to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs. We continue to regularly monitor and evaluate developments with respect to these new rules with our legal counsel, but we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. The conflict minerals reporting requirement discussed above is a direct consequence of our public status.\nWe may in the future become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, product liability, employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Any legal proceedings can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe have reported material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 and we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future or that we can effectively remediate our reported weaknesses. If our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nAs a result, we cannot assure you that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future or that we can effectively remediate our reported weaknesses. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or our intellectual property protection efforts are unsuccessful, others may duplicate our technology.\nOur operating companies rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, systems designs and manufacturing processes. The ability of others to use our intellectual property could allow them to duplicate the benefits of our products and reduce our competitive advantage. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will be issued or, in the case of patents issued, that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes. Further, a patent issued covering one use of our technology may not be broad enough to cover uses of that technology in other business areas. Even if all our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad, they may be challenged or invalidated or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are equivalent or superior to ours. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting patent and other intellectual property infringement suits and defending the validity of our patents and other intellectual property. While we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our property rights, we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so. These actions could place our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights at risk and could result in the loss of patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights protection for the products, systems and services on which our business strategy partly depends. Furthermore, it is not practical from a cost/benefit perspective to file for patent or trademark protection in every jurisdiction where we now or in the future may conduct business. In those territories where we do not have the benefit of patent or trademark protections, our competitors may be able to prevent us from selling our products or otherwise limit our ability to advertise under our established product names and we may face risks associated with infringement litigation as discussed below.\nWe rely, to a significant degree, on contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge. These trade secrets either cannot be protected by patent protection or we have determined that seeking a patent is not in our interest. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products and services if these claims are successful. We also may incur significant expenses in affirmatively protecting our intellectual property rights.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in many technology-related industries and we believe that the industries in which certain of our subsidiaries operate have a significant amount of patent activity. Third parties may claim that the technology or intellectual property that we incorporate into or use to develop, manufacture or provide our current and future products, systems or services infringe, induce or contribute to the infringement of their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to infringe, induce or contribute to the infringement of those intellectual property rights and may be required to obtain a license to use those rights. We may also be required to engage in costly efforts to design our products, systems and services around the intellectual property rights of others or incur additional marketing costs if we are prevented from using existing product names. The intellectual property rights of others may cover some of our technology, products, systems and services. In addition, the scope and validity of any particular third party patent may be subject to significant uncertainty.\nLitigation regarding patents or other intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming, and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or to indemnify our customers. However, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any inability on our part to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development, manufacture and sale of our products, systems or services. We may also be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, manufacture and sale of our products, systems or services. We also may be required to incur significant time and expense in pursuing claims against companies we believe are infringing or have misappropriated our intellectual property rights.\nIt can be difficult or expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.\nAs part of our business operations, we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. Insurance products are impacted by market fluctuations and can become expensive and sometimes very difficult to obtain. There can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance at an affordable price for the required limits. Our failure to obtain such insurance could lead to uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, or cause us to be out of compliance with our contractual obligations.\nWe may in the future be involved in product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we manufacture and distribute that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and our company. While insurance can mitigate some of this risk, due to our current size and limited operating history, we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance with significant coverage. Our customers may not accept the terms we have been able to procure and seek to terminate our existing contracts or cease to do business with us.\nThe timing and amount of revenue generated both from new customer orders and backlog fulfillment are subject to substantial volatility\nRecognition of revenue from sales to certain customers can be subject to delays beyond our control, such as timing of the receipt of component parts, change orders issued by the customer and delays in customers\u2019 scheduled installation dates, all of which we generally accommodate at no cost to the customer as part of our marketing efforts to them for repeat business.\nConcentrations of credit risk\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, escrow deposits and trade accounts receivable. The Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and escrow deposits were deposited primarily with U.S. banks and brokerage firms and amounted to $801,000 at December 31, 2016. The Company does not believe there is significant risk of non-performance by these counterparties. Approximately 28% of the accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 was due from one customer who pay their receivables over usual credit periods. Credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising the Company\u2019s customer base.\nRISKS RELATED TO OMNIMETRIX\nOmniMetrix has incurred net losses since our acquisition and may never achieve sustained profitability.\nOmniMetrix has generated losses since our acquisition in 2012 including losses of $1.2 million in 2016 and $1.6 million in 2015. While OmniMetrix has reduced its losses and its cash needs from us, particularly in the latter half of 2016 (OmniMetrix has not needed funding from us since September 2016), we can provide no assurance that OmniMetrix will be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to allow it to become profitable or to eventually sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows.\nAn increase in customer terminations would negatively affect our business by reducing OmniMetrix revenue or requiring us to spend more money to grow our customer base.\nNon-renewals or other monitoring service terminations could increase in the future due to customer dissatisfaction with our products and services, increased competition from other providers or alternative technologies.\nIf we have an increase in our non-renewal rate, we will have to acquire new customers on an ongoing basis just to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues. As a result, marketing expenditures are an ongoing requirement of our business. We incur significant costs to acquire new customers, and those costs are an important factor in determining our net profitability. Therefore, if we are unsuccessful in retaining customers or are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers, our revenue could decrease and our operating results could be affected.\nOmniMetrix is a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors, which may hinder its ability to compete effectively.\nSome of OmniMetrix\u2019s current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it does. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with OmniMetrix\u2019s existing and potential customers. They also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. In particular at the present time we are facing significant competition from generator manufacturers who offer their own monitoring solutions.\nOmniMetrix may not be able to access sufficient capital to support growth.\nOmniMetrix has been dependent on Acorn\u2019s ability and willingness to provide funding to support its business and growth strategy. Since our acquisition of OmniMetrix in February 2012, we invested approximately $14.0 million and through March 22, 2017 have lent $2,362,000 net of repayments (of which $618,000 (net of repayments) was in 2016) to OmniMetrix. OmniMetrix has reduced its borrowings from Acorn and has not borrowed from Acorn since September 2016, but will continue to need working capital in 2017 to support its growth and working capital needs.\nIn February 2016, OmniMetrix signed a Loan and Security Agreement with a lender providing OmniMetrix with access to accounts receivable formula-based financing of up to $500,000 (such financing was initially limited to $300,000 and subsequently increased to $500,000). In connection with this financing arrangement, OmniMetrix granted the lender a security interest in OmniMetrix\u2019s receivables, inventory and certain other assets. Debt incurred under this financing arrangement bears interest at the greater of prime (3.75% at December 31, 2016) plus 2% or 6% per year. In addition, OmniMetrix was to pay a monthly service charge of 1.125% of the average aggregate principal amount outstanding for the prior month, for a current effective rate of interest on advances of 19.5%.\nIn September 2016, the abovementioned Loan and Security Agreement was amended to reflect a reduced monthly service charge of 1.0% and modified formula determining the amount available from 80% of eligible hardware invoices and 40% of eligible monitoring invoices to 75% of all eligible invoices. In return, OmniMetrix agreed to maintain a minimum loan balance of $150,000 in its line-of-credit with the lender for a minimum of one year beginning October 1, 2016.\nWe have no assurance that this financing arrangement will provide sufficient liquidity for OmniMetrix\u2019s working capital needs in 2017. Additional financing for OmniMetrix may be in the form of a bank line, a new loan or investment by others, a loan by Acorn, or a combination of the above. The availability and amount of any additional loans from us to OmniMetrix may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities. Whether Acorn will have the resources necessary to provide funding, or whether alternative funds, such as third-party loans, will be available at the time and on terms acceptable to Acorn and OmniMetrix cannot be determined.\nOmniMetrix sells equipment and services which monitor third-party products, thus its revenues are dependent on the continued sales of such third-party products.\nOmniMetrix\u2019s end-user customer base is comprised exclusively of parties who have chosen to purchase either generators or cathodic protection systems. OmniMetrix has no ability to control the rate at which new generators or cathodic protection systems are acquired. When purchases of such products decline, the associated need for OmniMetrix\u2019s products and services is expected to decline as well.\nIf OmniMetrix is unable to keep pace with changing market or customer-mandated product and service improvements, OmniMetrix\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nMany of OmniMetrix\u2019s existing products may require ongoing engineering and upgrades in conjunction with market developments as well as specific customer needs. There can be no assurance that OmniMetrix will continue to be successful in its engineering efforts regarding the development of its products and future technological difficulties could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe cellular networks used by OmniMetrix are also subject to periodic technical updates that may require corresponding updates to, or replacement of, OmniMetrix\u2019s monitoring equipment.\nCellular networks have evolved over time to offer more robust technical capabilities in both voice and data transmission. At the present time, the changes from the so-called \u201c2G\u201d to \u201c3G\u201d and \u201c4G\u201d service have resulted in only limited service interruptions. OmniMetrix anticipates, however, that as these new capabilities come online, it will be necessary to have equipment that can readily interface with the newer cellular networks to avoid negative impacts on customer service. Not all of the costs associated with OmniMetrix\u2019s corresponding equipment upgrades can be passed on to customers and the increased expenses are expected to have a negative impact on OmniMetrix\u2019s operating results.\nA substantial portion of OmniMetrix\u2019s revenues are expected to be generated not from product sales, but from periodic monitoring fees and thus it is continually exposed to risks associated with its customers\u2019 financial stability.\nOmniMetrix sells on-going monitoring services to both PG and CP customers. It is therefore dependent on these customers continuing to timely pay service fees on an on-going basis. If a significant portion of these fees are not renewed from year-to-year, OmniMetrix can expect to experience deterioration in its financial condition.\nOmniMetrix\u2019s ability to provide, and to collect revenues from, monitoring services is dependent on the reliability of cellular networks not controlled by OmniMetrix.\nOmniMetrix provides monitoring services through the use of cellular technology utilizing the networks of third-party providers. These providers generally do not warrant their services to either OmniMetrix or the end users and any dropped transmissions could result in the loss of customer renewals and potential claims against OmniMetrix. While OmniMetrix uses contractual measures to limit its liability to customers, there is no assurance that such limitations will be enforced or that customers will not cancel monitoring services due to network issues.\nOmniMetrix\u2019s business is dependent on its ability to reliably store and manage data, but there can be no guarantee that it has sufficient capabilities to mitigate potential data loss in all cases.\nThe efficient operation of OmniMetrix\u2019s business is dependent on its information technology systems. In addition, OmniMetrix\u2019s ability to assist customers in analyzing data related to the performance of such customers\u2019 power and cathodic protection monitoring systems is an important component of its customer value proposition. OmniMetrix utilizes off-site data servers, housed within a commercial data center utilizing accepted data and power monitoring and protection processes, but whether a data loss can be avoided cannot be assured in every case. OmniMetrix\u2019s information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, sabotage (including theft and attacks by computer viruses or hackers), power outages; and computer systems, Internet, telecommunications or data network failure. Any interruption of OmniMetrix\u2019s information technology systems could result in decreased revenue, increased expenses, increased capital expenditures, customer dissatisfaction and potential lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO DSIT SOLUTIONS\nFailure to accurately forecast costs of fixed-priced contracts could reduce DSIT\u2019s margins.\nWhen working on a fixed-price basis, DSIT undertakes to deliver software or integrated hardware/software solutions to a customer\u2019s specifications or requirements for a particular project. The profits from these projects are primarily determined by DSIT\u2019s success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs. Costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors, including underestimating costs, difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract. If, for any reason, DSIT\u2019s costs are substantially higher than expected, it may incur losses on fixed-price contracts.\nDSIT recognizes revenue on contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, it records revenue as work on the contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenues recorded on a contract at a specific point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenues that man-months incurred to date bear to estimated man-months for the entire project. Accordingly, contract revenues and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenues in the period when such estimates are revised. Estimates are based on management\u2019s reasonable assumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Variation of actual results from assumptions on an unusually large project or on a number of average size projects could be material. DSIT is also required to immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on a contract when estimates indicate such a loss. Such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability, which would negatively impact its cash flow from operations.\nConditions in Israel may affect DSIT\u2019s operations.\nPolitical, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. An ongoing state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic problems for Israel. For a number of years there have been continuing hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians including with the Islamic movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which have adversely affected the peace process and at times have negatively influenced Israel\u2019s economy as well as its relationship with several other countries. Israel also faces threats from Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, from the government of Iran and other potential threats from neighboring countries, some of whom have recently undergone or are undergoing significant political changes, such as Egypt and Syria. In recent years there has also been a change in the relations between Israel and Turkey. These political, economic and military conditions in Israel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth. Furthermore, the mandatory military commitments of some DSIT personnel may temporarily impact our ability to produce our products on a timely basis if such personnel are called into service in connection with hostilities or otherwise.\nExchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of DSIT\u2019s operations.\nA majority of DSIT\u2019s sales are based on contracts or orders which are in U.S dollars or are in New Israeli Shekels (\u201cNIS\u201d) linked to the U.S. dollar. At the same time, most of DSIT\u2019s expenses are denominated in NIS (primarily labor costs) and are not linked to any foreign currency. The net effect of a devaluation of the U.S. dollar relative to the NIS is that DSIT\u2019s costs in dollar terms increases more than its revenues. At times, DSIT enters into forward contracts to try to mitigate its exposures to exchange rate fluctuations; however, no assurance can be provided that such controls will be implemented successfully. In 2016 the NIS strengthened in relation to the U.S. dollar by 1.5%.\nDSIT is substantially dependent on a small number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers may cause revenue and cash flow to decline.\nIn 2016, approximately 77% of DSIT\u2019s total revenue was concentrated in four customers. These customers are expected to continue to make up a significant portion of DSIT\u2019s revenue and cash flow in 2017. While DSIT does expect future follow on orders from each of these customers, the timing and amounts cannot be predicted. A significant reduction of future orders or delay in milestone payments from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the performance of DSIT.\nReduction in Israeli government spending or changes in priorities for defense products may adversely affect our earnings.\nThe Israeli Ministry of Defense is a significant customer of DSIT. The Israeli government may reduce its expenditures for defense items or change its defense priorities in the coming years. In addition, the Israeli defense budget may be adversely affected by any reductions in U.S. foreign military assistance. There is no assurance that DSIT\u2019s programs will not be affected in the future if there is a reduction in Israeli government defense spending for our programs or a change in priorities to products other than those of DSIT.\nPolitical relations could limit our ability to sell or buy internationally.\nDSIT could be adversely affected by the interruption or reduction of trade between Israel and its trading partners. Some countries, companies and organizations continue to participate in a boycott of Israeli firms and others doing business with Israel or with Israeli companies. Foreign government defense export policies towards Israel could also make it more difficult for us to obtain the export authorizations necessary for our activities. Also, over the past several years there have been calls in Europe and elsewhere to reduce trade with Israel. There can be no assurance that restrictive laws, policies or practices directed towards Israel or Israeli businesses will not have an adverse impact on DSIT\u2019s business.\nDSIT is a project-based business which is dependent on large orders from customers who typically have long acquisition cycles.\nDSIT is a project-based business which is dependent on large orders from customers who typically have long acquisition cycles. DSIT must constantly replace its pipeline of opportunities given what typically averages to at least an 18-month sales cycle.\nDSIT is dependent on meeting milestones to provide cash flow for its operations.\nDSIT\u2019s operations place a great reliance on it meeting project milestones in order to generate cash flow to finance its operations. Should DSIT encounter difficulties in meeting significant project milestones, resulting cash flow difficulties could have a material adverse effect on its operations.\nDSIT must at times provide significant guarantees in order to secure projects. These guarantees are often collateralized by restricted deposits.\nSome of the projects DSIT performs require significant performance and/or bank guarantees. At December 31, 2016, DSIT had approximately $7.3 million of performance and bank guarantees outstanding. In addition, DSIT had on deposit at two Israeli banks approximately $3.3 million collateralizing some of these guarantees. These deposits are restricted and, accordingly, DSIT cannot use these funds for operations until the guarantees which are being collateralized are released. At times, this can create cash flow difficulties which could have a material adverse effect on its operations.\nIf DSIT is unable to keep pace with rapid technological change, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may suffer.\nSome of DSIT\u2019s solutions are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence. DSIT\u2019s competitiveness and future success depends on its ability to keep pace with changing technologies and industry standards on a timely and cost-effective basis. A fundamental shift in technologies could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position. A failure to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay DSIT\u2019s development of new products, which could result in technological obsolescence, decreased revenues, and/or a loss of market share to competitors. To the extent that DSIT fails to keep pace with technological change, its revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nDSIT is dependent on a number of suppliers who provide it with components for some of its products.\nA number of DSIT\u2019s suppliers provide it with major components for some of its Naval Solutions products. Some of these components are long-lead items. If for some reason, the suppliers cannot provide DSIT with the component when it is needed and DSIT cannot easily find substitute suppliers on similar terms, DSIT may have increased costs and/or delays in delivering a product to a customer and incur penalties and lose customer confidence. In addition, project delays can also slow down revenue recognition and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. While DSIT is constantly attempting to develop secondary suppliers for these components, it can provide no assurance that it will be successful in doing so on acceptable terms.\nDSIT is a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors, which may hinder its ability to compete effectively.\nSome of DSIT\u2019s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it does. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with DSIT\u2019s existing and potential customers. They also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.\nDSIT has committed resources to enter the fiber optic security arena.\nDSIT has in prior years and is currently investing significant amounts of capital in creating the infrastructure to support its entrance into the fiber optic security market.\nIn September 2013, DSIT and Ramot, the technology transfer company of Tel-Aviv University, were jointly awarded a grant from MEIMAD. MEIMAD provides funding money for projects involving joint innovation and development between Israeli industrial companies and universities. This grant is for a two stage project for the joint development of a next generation fiber-optic based Perimeter Security System Interrogator. The total amount of the grant is approximately NIS 2.5 million (approximately $654,000 at the December 31, 2016 exchange rate) representing a 50% participation in DSIT\u2019s expenses.\nIn mid-2014, DSIT and Ramot were jointly awarded another grant from MEIMAD. This grant is for another two stage project for the development of a fiber optic sensing system to be used in structural health monitoring of airborne structures (such as planes and UAV\u2019s). The total amount of the grant is approximately NIS 2.4 million (approximately $635,000 at the December 31, 2016 exchange rate) representing a 50% participation in DSIT\u2019s expenses.\nBoth grants are conditioned on budget availability at the Office of the Chief Scientist (\u201cOCS\u201d) in the Ministry of the Economy in Israel and achieving the project\u2019s first milestones. If OCS funds are unavailable and/or the projects\u2019 milestones are not met on a timely basis, DSIT may not be able to access some or all of the grant funding.\nSales of our products to companies in the energy industry and defense departments may be impacted by the continued low price of oil and reduced defense budgets.\nDepressed oil prices have led to reduced spending by oil and other companies other companies in the energy industry. In addition, defense departments worldwide have generally been reducing expenditures. A continuation of low oil prices and reduced defense spending could negatively impact on our ability to receive orders from companies in the energy industry and defense departments who in the past have been amongst some of our significant customers. While DSIT is constantly striving to expand its customer base, there can be no assurance that DSIT will be successful in doing so.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nOur stock price is highly volatile and we do not expect to pay dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Investors may never obtain a return on their investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. During 2016, our common stock traded at prices as low as $0.07 and as high as $0.49 per share. Fluctuations in our stock price may continue to occur in response to various factors, many of which we cannot control, including: general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address, including the continued volatility in the energy industry and the general economy;\n\u25cf quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf strategic investments or divestments;\n\u25cf announcements of changes in our senior management;\n\u25cf the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors, customers or us;\n\u25cf the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets;\n\u25cf changes in accounting rules;\n\u25cf changes in investor perceptions; or\n\u25cf changes in expectations relating to our products, plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers.\nIn addition, the market prices of securities of energy related companies have been and remain volatile. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future. We intend to reinvest earnings, if any, in the development and expansion of our business. Accordingly, you will need to rely on sales of your common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, in order to realize a return on your investment\nOur share price may decline due to the large number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market including shares underlying warrants and options.\nAlmost all of our outstanding shares of common stock are, or could upon exercise of options or warrants become eligible for sale in the public market as described below. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the possibility of these sales, may adversely affect our stock price.\nAs of March 22, 2017, 29,367,019 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding. As of that date we had 2,654,423 warrants outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $1.46 and 1,405,404 options outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $3.79 per share, which if exercised would result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock. In addition to the options noted above, at March 22, 2017, 109,585 options are outstanding, but have not yet vested and are not yet exercisable.\nSubstantially all of our currently outstanding shares and shares issuable under our outstanding options and warrants are or would be freely tradable.\nWe may have to offer additional securities for sale in the near future.\nIn April 2016, we sold of a portion of our interest in DSIT and received gross proceeds of approximately $4.9 million which was used to repay our Leap Tide debt and provide working capital for us and OmniMetrix. In February 2017, we borrowed $900,000 from three of our directors and received a commitment from a director that would allow us to borrow up to an additional $1.0 million on or after July 7, 2017 (see Recent Developments) under certain conditions. Such cash together with the expected October 2017 receipt of escrowed funds from the DSIT Transaction and reduced cash need from OmniMetrix based on their expected continued growth is expected to finance our operations through at least the first quarter of 2018. The abovementioned director loans are due to be repaid at the earlier of April 30, 2018 or upon the sale of our remaining 41.2% interest DSIT which we are currently pursuing. Despite all this, we may ultimately not have sufficient cash to allow us to execute our plans and the occurrence of one or more unanticipated events may require us to make significant expenditures. Accordingly, we may need to raise additional amounts to finance our operations. If we were to do so by selling shares of our common stock and/or other securities convertible into shares of our common stock, current investors will incur additional dilution in the value of their shares.", "PERMNO": 77327, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "ACFN"}
