{"cik": "1097864", "company": "ON SEMICONDUCTOR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOverview\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes \u201cforward-looking statements,\u201d as that term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated in this Form 10-K could be deemed forward-looking statements, particularly statements about our plans, strategies and prospects under the headings \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cBusiness.\u201d Forward-looking statements are often characterized by the use of words such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d or \u201canticipates,\u201d or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. All forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are made based on our current expectations, forecasts, estimates and assumptions, and involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Among these factors are our revenues and operating performance, economic conditions and markets (including current financial conditions), effects of exchange rate fluctuations, the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in demand for our products, changes in inventories at our customers and distributors, technological and product development risks, enforcement and protection of our IP rights and related risks, risks related to the security of our information systems and secured network, availability of raw materials, electricity, gas, water and other supply chain uncertainties, our ability to effectively shift production to other facilities when required in order to maintain supply continuity for our customers, variable demand and the aggressive pricing environment for semiconductor products, our ability to successfully manufacture in increasing volumes on a cost-effective basis and with acceptable quality for our current products, risks associated with our pending acquisition of Fairchild, including: (1) the risk that the conditions to the closing of the transaction are not satisfied; (2) litigation challenging the transaction; (3) uncertainties as to the timing of the consummation of the transaction and the ability of each party to consummate the transaction; (4) risks that the proposed transaction disrupts our current plans and operations; (5) our ability to retain key personnel; (6) competitive responses to the transaction; (7) unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the transaction; (8) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the transaction; (9) our ability to realize the benefits of the acquisition of Fairchild; (10) delays, challenges and expenses associated with integrating the businesses; (11) delays, challenges and expenses associated with the indebtedness planned to be incurred in connection with the transaction; and (12) legislative, regulatory and economic developments, competitor actions, including the adverse impact of competitor product announcements, pricing and gross profit pressures, loss of key customers, order cancellations or reduced bookings, changes in manufacturing yields, control of costs and expenses and realization of cost savings and synergies from restructurings, significant litigation, risks associated with decisions to expend cash reserves for various uses in accordance with our capital\nallocation policy such as debt prepayment, stock repurchases, or acquisitions rather than to retain such cash for future needs, risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions (including from integrating and consolidating and timely filing financial information with the SEC for acquired businesses and difficulties encountered in accurately predicting the future financial performance of acquired businesses), risks associated with our substantial leverage and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements that may be in place from time to time, risks associated with our worldwide operations including foreign employment and labor matters associated with unions and collective bargaining arrangements as well as man-made and/or natural disasters affecting our operations and finances/financials, the threat or occurrence of international armed conflict and terrorist activities both in the United States and internationally, risks and costs associated with increased and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards, risks related to new legal requirements and risks involving environmental or other governmental regulation. Additional factors that could affect our future results or events are described from time to time in our SEC reports. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update such information, except as may be required by law.\nYou should carefully consider the trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\nFrom time to time, we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses, and we may experience additional declines in revenues and incur additional operating losses in the future.\nAt times, our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses. Reduced end-user demand, price declines, excess inventory, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, the effects of natural disasters such as the flooding in Thailand or the Japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011, and other factors have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns and upturns.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and, as a result, is subject to significant downturns and upturns. The industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles (for semiconductors and for the end-user products in which they are used) and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. In the event of such a downturn, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. On the other hand, significant upturns have led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner. In the event of such an upturn, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, or locate suitable third-party suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely\naffected. We may also not be able to balance our expansion activities and actual demand in such an environment. The overbuilding of capacity and excess increases of inventory by us and other companies can result in overcapacity in the industry and general price erosion.\nWe have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience them in the future. We cannot accurately predict the timing of the current and future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these conditions might be. These future conditions in the semiconductor industry could adversely impact our revenues and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to complete our acquisition of Fairchild may adversely affect our business and our share price.\nOur and Fairchild\u2019s obligations to consummate our acquisition of Fairchild are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, including (i) the absence of any law or order prohibiting or restraining the Fairchild Transaction or any law making the consummation of the Fairchild Transaction illegal, (ii) there being no event that has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on either us or Fairchild, (iii) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties in the Fairchild Agreement, and (iv) performance by ON Semiconductor and Fairchild of their respective obligations under the Fairchild Agreement. There can be no assurance that these conditions to the completion of the Fairchild Transaction will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. In addition, other factors, such as the possibility of an intervening offer for Fairchild or our ability to obtain the debt financing we need to consummate the Fairchild Transaction, may affect when and whether the Merger will occur. If the Fairchild Transaction is not completed, our share price could fall to the extent that our current price reflects an assumption that we will complete the acquisition. Furthermore, if the Fairchild Transaction is not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and share price, including the following: (1) we could be required to pay a termination fee of $215 million to Fairchild under certain circumstances as described in the Fairchild Agreement; (2) we would have incurred significant costs in connection with the acquisition that we would be unable to recover; (3) we may be subject to legal proceedings related to failure to complete the Fairchild Transaction; (4) the failure to consummate the Fairchild Transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community; and (5) any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Fairchild Transaction, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, vendors and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the acquisition is not consummated.\nIn addition, we would not realize any of the expected benefits of having completed the Fairchild Transaction. The Fairchild Transaction, if completed, will be our largest acquisition to date, by a significant margin. The benefits we expect to realize from the acquisition of Fairchild are necessarily based on projections and assumptions about combining our business with Fairchild, which may not materialize or which may prove to be inaccurate.\nUncertainty about the Fairchild Transaction may adversely affect our business and share price, whether or not the Fairchild Transaction is completed.\nWe are subject to risks in connection with the announcement and pendency of the Fairchild Transaction, including: (1) the pendency and outcome of the legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against us, our directors and others relating to the Fairchild Transaction; and (2) that we may forgo opportunities we might otherwise pursue absent the Fairchild Agreement.\nUncertainties about the Fairchild Transaction may also cause our current and prospective employees (including employees at Fairchild) to experience uncertainty about their future with us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to retain, recruit or motivate key management, sales, marketing, engineering, technical and other personnel.\nIn addition, in response to the announcement of the Fairchild Transaction, our existing or prospective customers, vendors or suppliers may: (1) delay, defer or cease purchasing goods or services from or providing goods or services to us; (2) delay or defer other decisions concerning us, or refuse to extend credit to us; or (3) otherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with us.\nWhile we are attempting to address these risks through communications with our existing and prospective customers, vendors and suppliers, they may be reluctant to purchase our products due to potential uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings and the support and service of our products after we complete the Fairchild Transaction.\nWe may fail to realize the benefits expected from the Fairchild Transaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nAlthough we expect significant benefits to result from the Fairchild Transaction, there can be no assurance that we will actually realize these or any other anticipated benefits of the Fairchild Transaction. The price for our stock, following completion of the Fairchild Transaction may be affected by our ability to achieve the benefits expected to result from the Fairchild Transaction. Achieving the benefits of the Fairchild Transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate Fairchild\u2019s business successfully and efficiently with our business.\nWe intend to finance the estimated $2.4 billion of cash consideration with a combination of cash on hand, new, fully-committed debt financing and proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities. The debt that we expect to incur will bear interest based on floating rate indices or, in the event of the issuance of any debt securities, at fixed rates to be determined at the time of issuance based on prevailing market conditions. As a result, increases in prevailing interest rates related to this new debt financing would result in a higher cost of capital and significantly increase our annual interest expense even though the amounts borrowed would remain the same, which likely would reduce the anticipated benefits of the Fairchild Transaction and would adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe challenges involved in this integration, which will be complex and time consuming, include the following: (1) demonstrating to customers of ON Semiconductor and Fairchild that the Fairchild Transaction will not adversely affect our ability to address the needs of customers or result in the loss of attention or business focus; (2) coordinating and integrating research and development and engineering teams across technologies and product platforms to enhance product development while reducing costs; (3) consolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures; (4) coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities and the direction of product development; and (5) minimizing the diversion of management attention from important business objectives.\nIf we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating Fairchild, then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Fairchild Transaction and our post-acquisition revenue, expenses, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, any of which could materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nLitigation challenging the Fairchild Agreement may prevent the Fairchild Transaction from being consummated at all or within the expected timeframe.\nFairchild, Fairchild\u2019s board of directors, ON Semiconductor and our wholly-owned subsidiary Falcon Operations Sub, Inc. are currently parties to a putative shareholder class action related to the Fairchild Transaction and may be parties to additional, similar claims and litigation. Among other remedies, the plaintiff in the proceeding to which we are a party seeks to enjoin the Fairchild Transaction. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the Fairchild Transaction from becoming effective in a timely manner. The pending litigation is, and any additional litigation could be, time consuming and expensive, could divert our management\u2019s attention away from their regular business, and, if any one of these lawsuits is adversely resolved against either us or Fairchild, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to effect the Fairchild Transaction.\nOne of the conditions to closing the Fairchild Transaction is that no governmental entity having jurisdiction over us or Fairchild shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other material action enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Fairchild Transaction substantially on the terms contemplated by the Fairchild Agreement, and that no law shall have been enacted or promulgated by any governmental entity that makes the consummation of the Fairchild Transaction illegal. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in the lawsuits referenced above and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting our ability to complete the Fairchild Transaction on terms contemplated by the Fairchild Agreement, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Fairchild Transaction from being effective in a timely manner or at all. For additional information regarding this litigation, see Note 12: \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cLegal Matters\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by significant price erosion, especially after a product has been on the market for a significant period of time.\nOne of the results of the rapid innovation in the semiconductor industry is that pricing pressure, especially with respect to products containing older technology, can be intense. Product life cycles are relatively short and, as a result, products tend to be replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes on a frequent basis. In turn, demand for older technology falls, causing the price at which such products can be sold to drop, in some cases precipitously. In order to continue to profitably supply these products, we must reduce our production costs in line with the lower prices we can expect to receive per unit. Usually, this must be accomplished through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies. If we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins, we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of these products. Moreover, we may not be able to cease production of such products, either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and, as a result, may be required to bear a loss on such products. Should reductions in our manufacturing costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell, this could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.\nEconomic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nAdverse global economic conditions may result in fluctuations and reductions in consumer and commercial spending from time to time, and such conditions or uncertainties about such conditions may result in lower orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. The semiconductor industry has often experienced significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of,\ndeclines in general economic conditions. Volatility in global economic conditions, including the level of the economic recovery in the United States, the growth rate of the Chinese economy, the effect of conditions in Japan, including a weakened demand environment and Japanese Yen, and economic weakness in many other countries and regions, volatility in oil prices and conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, may adversely and materially affect our industry, business and results of operations, and we cannot accurately predict volatility or how severe and prolonged any downturn or recovery might be. Reduced spending has in the past driven us and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing, which results in a negative effect on gross profit. In addition, to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected, our business and results of operations could be adversely and materially affected. Moreover, volatility in revenues as a result of unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our short-term and long-term strategies.\nFurthermore, the United States and global credit markets could experience renewed financial turmoil. If the past pressures on credit were renewed or we experience an additional global downturn, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all, and we may not be able to refinance, if necessary, any outstanding debt when due, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity, on terms acceptable to us, to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures for the immediate future, if our operating results falter and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, global financial uncertainty affecting the financial markets and economies generally could impact our business in a number of other ways, including causing (1) our customers and consumers in general to defer purchases, (2) our customers difficulties in obtaining sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us, (3) our key suppliers to become capacity-constrained or insolvent, resulting in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and (4) our key suppliers to require acceleration of payments to them or our customers to delay payments to us. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses, incurring additional debt, assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders.\nIn order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities, we have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties. Successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require, among other factors, efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts. We face risks resulting from the expansion of our operations through acquisitions, including but not limited to: (1) the difficulty of integrating, aligning and coordinating organizations, which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures; (2) risks of entering new semiconductor markets or regions of the world in which we have limited experience; (3) risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies; (4) the risk that our due diligence in the acquisition process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities that are in existence at the time of our acquisitions; (5) the risk that our existing or prospective customers or customers of the acquired business may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions as we integrate new businesses and companies into our business, or that they may seek to change their existing business relationships; (6) challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions, including difficulties in entering into new market segments in which we are not experienced;\n(7) the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets; (8) difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses; (9) the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the daily operations of existing businesses; and (10) negative pressure on gross margins resulting from increased operating and restructuring costs.\nThe integration of newly acquired businesses will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management. The diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development, marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships. Moreover, even if we were able to fully integrate a new acquisition\u2019s business operations and other assets successfully, there can be no assurance that such integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible or were anticipated from the acquisition or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time. Delays in integrating our acquisitions, which could be caused by factors outside of our control, could adversely affect the intended benefits of the acquisitions to our business, financial results, financial condition and the trading price of our stock and other securities.\nIn addition, current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us, and as a result, we could lose key employees. These uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel. In connection with a transaction, key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in the form of change-in-control agreements, acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equity-based compensation rights. These amounts could impact their willingness to continue to work for us. Further, as a result of our acquisitions, we may assume liabilities from the target\u2019s current employee benefit plans that may require us to bring plan documentation into compliance with current law, including ensuring that plans are adequately funded.\nIn connection with our acquisition activity, we are required by generally accepted accounting principles and SEC rules and regulations to integrate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements. The acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements, or if they do have independent audited financial statements, such statements may not be prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems, which could materially impair our ability to obtain or prepare necessary financial information concerning such businesses in a format required to allow proper integration with our systems and financial statements. In addition, immediately after an acquisition and until such time as we are able to fully integrate an acquired business into our financial statements, we may be dependent on the acquired business\u2019 financial controls and systems for reporting and other financial information, including projections and goals for such acquired business. We may not be able to successfully prepare and file required financial statements or other financial information for the acquired business, or to integrate the acquired business into our financial controls and systems and our consolidated financial statements in a timely manner. Failure to prepare accurate financial reports for our acquired businesses in a timely manner in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States could cause material inaccuracies in our financial statements and SEC filings, which could result in the necessity to restate our financials or lead to unknown liabilities and possibly result in a material impact on the trading price of our stock and other securities.\nIn connection with an acquisition, including the acquisition of Fairchild, it is possible that we may anticipate tax savings through integration of the newly acquired business into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure. As with any estimate, it is possible that the estimates of the potential savings could turn out to be incorrect.\nWe review goodwill associated with our acquisitions for impairment at least on an annual basis (see Part II, Item 7: \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d Note 2: \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies - Goodwill\u201d and Note 5: \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d of the notes to our consolidated audited financial statements located elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information about goodwill). In the past, we have recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions. Factors we consider important that could result in a subsequent impairment to goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends. We may have further material goodwill impairments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances, which could be dilutive to existing stockholders. We may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances, which could harm our financial position and operating results. In any such case, it is possible that factors outside of our control, including but not limited to increases in interest rates and loss of key customers, could adversely affect the intended benefits from an acquisition, even though we would continue to have a repayment obligation under the related loan agreement.\nOur gross profit is dependent on a number of factors, including our level of capacity utilization and realizing expected synergies from acquisitions.\nSemiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment, leading to high fixed costs and depreciation expense. We believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing. For instance, if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits.\nMoreover, we believe that we will need to continue to improve the margin levels of our System Solutions Group. While we anticipate that certain cost reduction measures taken, including voluntary retirement programs implemented in 2013 and 2014, should improve the margin levels of the System Solutions Group business, we may benefit fully from such actions and may need to take additional cost reduction measures.\nThe failure to successfully implement profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions, including restructuring activities, could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to, among other factors, significant downturns in our industry. These initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions, transitioning higher-cost external supply to internal manufacturing, working with our material suppliers to further lower costs, personnel reductions, reductions in employee compensation, temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead. In the past, we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives. These costs have been primarily composed of employee separation costs and asset impairments. See Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Operating Expenses\u201d under the heading \u201cRestructuring, asset impairments and other, net\u201d and Note 6: \u201cRestructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information on restructuring activities.\nWe also often undertake restructuring activities in connection with our business acquisitions, which can result in significant charges, including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges.\nWe cannot assure you that our restructuring plans and cost reduction initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented, or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability. Because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business, the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated. Even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business, including unintended employee attrition.\nFor additional information regarding our profitability enhancement programs and cost reduction measures, see Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Operating Expenses\u201d under the heading \u201cRestructuring, asset impairments and other, net\u201d and Note 6: \u201cRestructuring, Asset Impairments and Other, Net\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nIf we are unable to implement our business strategy, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes, without limitation, plans to: (1) continue to aggressively manage, maintain and refine our product portfolio; (2) continue to develop leading edge customer support services; (3) further expand our just-in-time delivery capabilities; (4) increase our die manufacturing capacity in a cost-effective manner; (5) further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows; (6) rationalize our manufacturing operations; (7) relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions; (8) reduce selling and administrative expenses; (9) manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands; (10) actively manage working capital; (11) develop new products in a more efficient manner; and (12) integrate newly acquired products, manufacturing capabilities and sales channels. We cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations. In particular, we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential, increase our volume or revenue, rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses.\nOur business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products, and the new products and applications that we are developing, and on our ability to produce our products profitably. Each of these factors depends on our ability, among other factors, to finance our operating and product development activities, maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations, relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations, access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a cost-effective and timely manner, protect our IP portfolio and attract and retain highly-skilled technical, managerial, marketing and finance personnel. Several of these factors and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy, such as risks associated with international operations, the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities, the impact of natural disasters and cyber attacks, increased competition, legal developments and general economic conditions, are beyond our control. In addition, circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy.\nWe may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business.\nThe semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive. See Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Operating Expenses\u201d under the heading \u201cResearch and Development\u201d for a description of our expenditures for research and development.\nAn inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us, and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products.\nRapidly changing technologies and industry standards, along with frequent new product introductions, characterize the industries that are currently the primary end-users of semiconductors. As these industries evolve and introduce new products, our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and cost-effective manner by designing, developing, manufacturing, marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies. The development of new products is a complex and time-consuming process and often requires significant capital investment. Additionally, expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. There can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes, known as \u201cdesign wins,\u201d for new products. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products, including any delays in establishing sufficient manufacturing capacity, could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or that we will generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and end-users, including changes due to evolving consumer preferences, international political developments influencing end-user preferences, and natural disasters or other extraordinary events that impact our customers or end-users and adapt to such changes in a timely and cost-effective manner. Nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. There is no assurance that the products we develop and market will be well received by customers, that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop new products, that a significant investment in new products will be profitable or that we will have margins as high as we anticipate at the time of investment or have experienced historically. Further, a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or end-users could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.\nUncertainties involving the timing and amount of orders, and payment for, our products could adversely affect our business.\nOur sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements, and we generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days for custom products without incurring a significant penalty. We routinely generate inventory based on customers\u2019 estimates of demand for their products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In\naddition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. Furthermore, short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers.\nCompetition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. Although only a few companies compete with us in most of our product lines, we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. Because our components are often building block semiconductors that, in some cases, are integrated into more complex ICs, we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, ASICs and fully customized ICs, as well as from customers who develop their own IC products. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. In different product lines, we compete, to varying degrees, on the basis of price, quality, technical performance, product features, product system compatibility, customized design, strategic relationships with customers, new product innovation, availability, delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support. Gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used, such as personal computers, tablets, industrial and telecommunications equipment, consumer electronics and automotive goods. Any inability to maintain revenues or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and on our business and prospects as a whole.\nThe semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidation that could adversely affect our competitiveness. Many of our competitors, particularly larger competitors resulting from consolidations, may have certain advantages over us, including: substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products; longer independent operating histories; presence in key markets; patent protection; and greater name recognition.\nUnless we maintain manufacturing efficiency, our future profitability could be adversely affected.\nManufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. We and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance. Impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. Our manufacturing efficiency is and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities, transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields. We cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of, among other conditions and events, capacity constraints, construction delays, transferring production to other facilities (including as a part of our cost reduction measures and in reaction to man-made and natural\ndisasters, such as the 2011 flooding in Thailand), upgrading or expanding existing facilities, changing our process technologies or uncertainty as a result of the acquisition and integration of manufacturing facilities acquired as a result of our acquisition activities, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues. Our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity, if revenues do not increase proportionately.\nWe could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing, information technology and equipment to remain competitive, and any failure, inadequacy or delayed implementation could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. Such capital expenditures and commitments, as well as other commitments, may materially decrease our liquidity.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances. Semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive, as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller, more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices. Our manufacturing, assembly and test facilities have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment. We have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and utilize these new technologies. There also is no assurance that the new technologies we do develop and utilize will be sufficient to support our business operations and strategies, or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such new technologies.\nWe also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency. Any such implementation, however, can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation, any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or, in some instances, to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned. In the case of abandonment, we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet.\nIn the recent past, we have undertaken various and material cost reduction measures which we believe have been largely successful. However, these reductions, and any future reductions, may unintentionally affect our ability to remain competitive in efficiency and productivity. Ultimately, we may be forced to increase our future capital expenditures in unexpected ways to meet our operational needs in, among other areas, manufacturing, information technology and equipment. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make timely and necessary investments in the areas discussed above or other areas we have not identified.\nWe are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and other business disruptions.\nOur worldwide operations are subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions from time to time, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial reporting and condition. We are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods, hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, and other extreme weather conditions, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and similar natural disasters, as well as power outages, power shortages, telecommunications failures, industrial accidents, and similar events. Such events can cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property, including our books and financial and corporate records and data, and related internal controls, and can also have significant direct and indirect consequences. For example, such events can negatively impact revenues and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow, both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event. Such costs may include expenses to\nrestore production or to move production to other facilities, including incremental capital expenditures and costs for expedited shipping, expenses incurred with a shut-down of the damaged facility, including employee severance payments, and other unusual costs and expenses such as fixed asset impairments, inventory write-downs, charges relating to cancellation of purchase orders for excess materials and charges for restoration and recovery work. Overall costs may also be impacted by other factors, such as the under-absorption of our manufacturing and operating support overhead. For example, in the case of our facility in Roznov, Czech Republic that manufactures silicon wafers used by a number of our facilities, any natural or man-made disaster, operational disruption, or other extraordinary event that impacted the facility or regional infrastructure would have a substantial adverse effect on our ability to produce a number of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, costs, and/or prospects if we were unable to effectively source silicon wafers on acceptable terms from qualified third parties to replace the production loss. Such events may also affect the infrastructure of the country in which the event occurs, causing water damage, power outages and rolling blackouts, transportation delays and restrictions, public health issues and economic instability and disrupting local and international supply chains. As a result, we could experience shortages of, and interruptions in supply and increased prices for, components that we source from companies located in or with operations in any such country, as well as from other suppliers whose supply chains may similarly be affected. Such shortages and interruptions may also affect our ability to communicate with our customers and suppliers and to timely deliver our products to customers and, as a result, our customers may seek substitute products from other manufacturers. In addition, damage or destruction to our books and financial and corporate records and data could adversely affect our ability to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the historical and future reporting of our financial results and our ability to integrate the financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies. Responding to natural disasters and their consequences will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management. The diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development, marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships. Although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above, such insurance may be subject to deductible and coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms.\nIf we were to lose one of our large customers, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.\nProduct sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business. Many of our customers operate in cyclical industries, and, in the past, we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered. Generally, our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products. We cannot assure you that any of our customers will not turn to other suppliers, significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects. See Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness - Customers\u201d for a description of revenues from our largest customers.\nWe rely on customers in the automotive and communications industries for a significant portion of our revenue.\nA significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive and communications industries (including networking). Sales into these industries represented approximately 33% and 18% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, and those percentages will vary from quarter to quarter. Both the automotive and communications industries are cyclical, and, as a result, our customers in these industries are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, which can adversely affect sales of our products.\nAdditionally, the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in these industries could decline despite continued growth in these end markets. Lower sales to customers in the automotive or communications industry may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services, or increases in the prices of such goods or services, could adversely affect our operations and productivity.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner, the costs of our raw materials increase significantly, their quality deteriorates or the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products. Our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials, including polysilicon, silicon wafers, gold, copper, lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. Generally, our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations, and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just-in-time basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry.\nIn addition, for some of our products, we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials. The number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited. The inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt production in material ways. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules. Disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers.\nWe also use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods. Our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and, in some cases, require longer-term commitments in the early stages of the relationship. Our operations and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated, the cost of such services increased significantly, the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect. In any such case, arranging for replacement contractors can be time consuming and costly, and we may encounter start-up difficulties.\nOur international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations.\nA significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the Asia/Pacific region, the Americas, and Europe, and we maintain significant operations in these regions. In addition, we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the Asia/Pacific region. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets. Risks inherent in doing business on an international level include, among others, the following:\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability (including as a result of the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks);\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements, tariffs, customs, duties and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nexposure to different legal standards, customs, business practices, tariffs, duties and other trade barriers, including changes with respect to price protection, competition practices, IP, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, trade and travel restrictions, pandemics, import and export license requirements and restrictions, and accounts receivable collections;\n\u2022\ntransportation and other supply chain delays and disruptions;\n\u2022\npower supply shortages and shutdowns;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations including collective bargaining agreements and workers councils, exposure to foreign labor laws and other employment and labor issues;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\ncurrency convertibility and repatriation;\n\u2022\ntaxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of earnings and potential taxation of foreign profits in the United States;\n\u2022\npotential violations by our international employees or third party agents of international or U.S. laws relevant to foreign operations (e.g., the Federal Corrupt Practices Act);\n\u2022\ndifficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nother risks relating to the administration of or changes in, or new interpretations of, the laws, regulations and policies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.\nOther activities outside the United States are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. For instance, while our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations.\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe have historically benefited from relatively low effective tax rates because most of our income has been earned and reinvested in jurisdictions outside the U.S. However, our effective tax rate is uncertain on an ongoing basis. Changes to income tax regulations in the United States and the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could, under our existing tax structure, significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operations and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, other factors or events, including business combinations and investment transactions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns or as a result of deficiencies asserted by taxing authorities, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in available tax credits, increasing operations in high tax jurisdictions, and changes in tax rates, could also increase our future effective tax rate.\nOur tax filings are subject to review or audit by the Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. An assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These changes, if adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. In the U.S., a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies, but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time.\nThe distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the United States may be subject to United States income taxes, thus reducing our net income.\nWe hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the United States. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, debt repurchases, payments, acquisitions, including our potential acquisition of Fairchild, and stock repurchases. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, through borrowings under our current debt agreements or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nExcept as required under U.S. tax law, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings. Any such taxes would reduce our net income in the period in which these earnings are distributed.\nWe operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries, and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies and/or legal entity structures, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries, and are therefore subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Transfer pricing regulations generally require that, for tax purposes, transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm\u2019s length transaction between unrelated parties. There is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules. To the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties. Based on our current knowledge and probability assessment of potential outcomes, we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures. However, the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operational results. Changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in us becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nA significant amount of our international business is transacted in local currency and a significant percentage of our cash and cash equivalents are held outside of the United States, which exposes us to risk relating to currency fluctuations, changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability and financial flexibility.\nWe have sizeable sales and operations in Asia and European regions. A significant amount of this business is transacted in local currency. As a result, our financial performance is impacted by currency fluctuations.\nA significant percentage of our cash and cash equivalents is currently held outside the United States, and we continue to generate profits outside of the United States, while many of our liabilities, including our outstanding indebtedness, and certain other cash payments, such as share repurchases, are payable in U.S. dollars.\nRepatriation of some of the funds held outside the United States could have potential adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay because of required local country approvals or local obligations. In addition, at times we are required to make cash deposits to support bank guarantees of our obligations under certain office leases or amounts we owe to certain vendors from whom we purchase goods and services. Nearly all of these arrangements are outside of the United States, and these cash deposits are not available for other uses as long as the bank guarantees are outstanding. Foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency. As a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the United States, our financial flexibility may be reduced, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations. Our balance of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $517.8 million at December 31, 2014 and our balance of cash and cash equivalents was $617.6 million at December 31, 2015, and of those amounts, approximately $203.6 million and $240.7 million was available in the United States at December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\nIf we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate.\nOur success, both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions, depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-skilled design, technical, managerial, marketing and financial personnel. The market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive. In addition, from time to time, we have announced certain cost reductions that included the freezing of salaries and elimination of bonuses, mandatory unpaid time off, factory shutdowns and reduction in personnel. We also establish performance criteria for awards to officers and employees under bonus and other incentive plans and programs that may not be satisfied. These measures, as well as any future measures, could negatively affect morale and lead to unintended employee attrition at all levels of our organization. Moreover, we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel and our existing employment agreements do not require the employee to continue to work for us.\nAs employee incentives, we have issued common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time, RSUs with time-based vesting and performance-based awards. Any difficulty relating to obtaining stockholder approval of new, or amendments to, equity compensation plans could limit our ability to issue these types of awards. Our stock price at times has declined substantially, reducing the effectiveness of certain of these incentives. Loss of the services of, or failure to effectively recruit, qualified personnel, including senior managers and design engineers, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business. Some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties, and litigation could arise in the future. If we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered IP assets, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies. These laws and regulations are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts. Additionally, some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications. With respect to our IP generally, we cannot assure you that:\n\u2022\nany of the substantial number of U.S. or foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or licensed to others;\n\u2022\nany of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;\n\u2022\nany of the trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how or mask works that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or licensed to others; or\n\u2022\nany of our pending or future trademark, copyright, or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought.\nIn addition, our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies, duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies. Effective IP protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in the United States and in foreign countries.\nAlso, we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing third-party IP rights. If necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under such IP rights. However, we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for IP we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies. Litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. In the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation, we may be required to:\n\u2022\npay substantial damages;\n\u2022\nindemnify customers or distributors;\n\u2022\ncease the manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products;\n\u2022\nexpend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies;\n\u2022\ndiscontinue the use of processes; or\n\u2022\nobtain licenses, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to the infringing technologies.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition. Any such development, acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources.\nWe also seek to protect our proprietary technologies, including technologies that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors\u2019 rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to IP arising out of our research.\nWe may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to enforce our patents, trademarks, copyrights, software licenses and other IP is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we are often subject to claims that the IP right is invalid, is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim. In addition, our assertion of IP rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged IP rights of its own against us, which may adversely impact our business. An unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products, which could in turn negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged IP rights.\nWe are subject to litigation risks, including securities class action litigation, which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain.\nAll industries, including the semiconductor industry, are subject to legal claims, including securities litigation, litigation in connection with acquisitions and litigation over executive compensation and disclosure of executive compensation. The price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions and executive compensation will not subject us to additional litigation. This sort of litigation can be particularly costly and may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. We are involved in a variety of legal matters, most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations. These routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers, employment and labor and IP. We believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, defense and settlement costs can be substantial, even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace. See Part I, Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this report for more information on our legal proceedings.\nWe are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards.\nLike most publicly traded companies, we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, which requires management\u2019s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm. As we continue to make strategic acquisitions, mergers and alliances, the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls. While we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in the future. Failure to comply with SOX, including delaying or failing to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness, may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such transactions, and the trading price of our common stock or other securities may decline. In addition, if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements, our financial statements may be materially inaccurate, our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline. See Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting.\nRegulations that impose disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in our products will result in additional cost and expense and could result in other significant adverse effects.\nRules adopted by the SEC implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in our products. Compliance with these rules will result in additional cost and expense, including for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our semiconductor devices as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d metals or components that can be used in our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such metals or components in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. The cost of compliance to our service providers, foundries, subcontractors and suppliers could also be passed along to us, resulting in higher prices for the materials or components we use in our products. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the metals used in our products. We may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, such customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier, which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory.\nEnvironmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air, water and ground. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other requirements, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. Motorola has agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operation of our business or Motorola\u2019s ownership, occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization and spinout from Motorola. We also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances. However, we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs. In addition, the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities.\nBased on information currently available to us, we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and any liability for currently known environmental conditions, will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects. However, we cannot predict:\n\u2022\nchanges in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nthe manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted;\n\u2022\nour ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims, including the cost of clean-up of currently unknown environmental conditions; or\n\u2022\nthe cost of fines, penalties or other legal liability, should we fail to comply with environmental or health and safety laws or regulations.\nWarranty claims, product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nManufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a tightly controlled, clean environment. Minute impurities in our manufacturing materials, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, manufacturing equipment failures, and other defects can cause our products to be non-compliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage (or both). In addition, if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in their recall. As suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design, OEMs are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls. A successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage, if any, and established reserves, or a requirement that we participate in a product recall, would have adverse effects (that could be material) on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSince a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved. In certain instances, we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts. There is no assurance that such limitations will be effective.\nNew legal requirements, particularly with respect to health care reform, could increase the cost of our employee benefits and adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs to maintain competitive employee benefits to attract and retain our highly skilled personnel. Changes to the regulatory environment with respect to these benefits could adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations. In particular, the health care reform legislation enacted by the U.S. Congress is intended to result in significant changes to the U.S. health care system. This legislation may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of the new healthcare regulations and may impair our ability to provide the same level of coverage.\nWe may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could damage our reputation and harm our business and operating results.\nWe may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses, illegal hacking, or acts of vandalism or terrorism. Additionally, the proprietary, sensitive or confidential information we manage and store may be subject to accidental loss, misuse, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination. Our security measures and/or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches. In some cases, we may initially be unaware of an incident or its magnitude or effects. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. We also provide certain confidential and proprietary information to our third party service providers and other business partners, and the systems of these third parties could be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromised. Any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business, cause an interruption in our operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation, which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.\nThe theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance regulatory environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, our even inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties.\nWe sell a significant, and increasing, portion of our products through distributors. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have substantial debt service obligations. On May 1, 2015, we amended our senior revolving credit facility to among other things, increase the borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion and on June 8, 2015, we issued $690.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.00% Notes. We incur debt from time to time to repay or refinance other outstanding debt, to make acquisitions or for other purposes. See Note 20: \u201cRecent Developments and Subsequent Events\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a description of certain additional debt we may acquire in connection with our acquisition of Fairchild. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\nthe timing, amount and execution of our capital allocation policy, including our share repurchase program, could be affected by the degree to which we are leveraged;\n\u2022\na significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt, which reduces the funds available to us for our operations;\n\u2022\nsome of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest, which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates;\n\u2022\nour debt agreements may contain, and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain, financial and restrictive covenants, and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions;\n\u2022\nas our long-term debt ages, we may need to renegotiate or repay such debt or seek additional financing (see Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this report under \u201cContractual Obligations\u201d within the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section);\n\u2022\nour debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the semiconductor industry; and\n\u2022\nour substantial leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors who may have less leverage relative to their overall capital structures.\nWe may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt, which could exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including in connection with our acquisition of Fairchild. See Note 20: \u201cRecent Developments and Subsequent Events\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a description of certain additional debt we may acquire in connection with our acquisition of Fairchild. The agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness from time to time may limit us and our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness. While we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next 12 months, if we incur additional debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify, and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities. Moreover, the debt we may incur from time to time may require collateral to secure such indebtedness, which would place our assets at risk, as well as limit our flexibility\nrelated to such assets. Ultimately, we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms, or at all, and we may need to curtail our operations significantly, reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development, or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate, including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive.\nThe agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions.\nOur debt agreements from time to time may contain, and any future debt agreements may include, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on, among other decisions we might make, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt, including guarantees;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nmake some acquisitions;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations or certain other \u201cchange in control\u201d transactions;\n\u2022\nmake distributions to our shareholders;\n\u2022\nengage in restructuring activities;\n\u2022\nengage in certain sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nissue or repurchase stock or other securities.\nSuch agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements, including to maintain certain financial ratios and condition tests. Our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them. These restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us. Any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable.\nOur failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nIf there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately, which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments, either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or, if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event, that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness, which could impact our operations. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments. A default under our committed credit facilities, including our senior revolving credit facility, could also limit our ability to make further borrowings under those facilities. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business; unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. These restrictions may also affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling additional assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. The terms of our financing agreements from time to time may contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. We cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations. In addition, to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations, we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to the current stockholders.\nWe conduct our operations through subsidiaries who may have no independent obligation to repay our debt.\nWe conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time, including under our senior revolving credit facility, are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nServicing the 1.00% Notes may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 1.00% Notes in a timely manner.\nIn June 2015, we issued $690.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.00% Notes. Holders of the 1.00% Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a\nfundamental change (as defined under the indenture governing the 1.00% Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 1.00% Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon conversion of the 1.00% Notes to be repurchased, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 1.00% Notes being converted. Moreover, we will be required to repay the 1.00% Notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased. Servicing the 1.00% Notes may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 1.00% Notes. Our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 1.00% Notes, repurchase the 1.00% Notes in the event of a fundamental change or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the 1.00% Notes, we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock, which would dilute existing stockholders. In addition, if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the 1.00% Notes following a fundamental change, we would be in default under the terms of the 1.00% Notes, which could cross default other debt and materially, adversely harm our business. The terms of the 1.00% Notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur, and if we incur significantly more debt, this could intensify the risks described above. Our decision to use our cash for other purposes, such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock, could also intensify these risks. See Note 8: \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information on our 1.00% Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 1.00% Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2020, holders may convert the 1.00% Notes only if specified conditions are met. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 1.00% Notes is triggered, holders of the 1.00% Notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 1.00% Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, if the conditional conversion feature of the 1.00% Notes is triggered, even if holders do not elect to convert their 1.00% Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 1.00% Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nNote hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may affect the value of the 1.00% Notes and our common stock.\nConcurrently with the issuance of the 1.00% Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions, which we refer to as the option counterparties. The convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the 1.00% Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 1.00% Notes, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds $25.96. See Note 9: \u201cEarnings Per Share and Equity\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock following the pricing of the 1.00% Notes. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 1.00% Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 1.00% Notes or following any repurchase of the 1.00% Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock or the 1.00% Notes.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions.\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions.\nOur exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the option counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties.\nThe fundamental change repurchase feature of our convertible notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.\nThe terms of our convertible notes require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change. In certain circumstances, a takeover of our company could trigger an option of the holders of the notes to require us to repurchase the notes. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors in the notes. A change of control may also trigger a default or other consequences under certain of our other indebtedness, including our senior revolving credit facility.\nConversion of convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders, including holders who had previously converted their convertible notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our stock.\nUnder the terms of the 2.625% Notes, Series B, any conversions of the 2.625% Notes, Series B will be settled in cash up to the par value of the notes being converted, with the excess of the conversion value over the par value being settled in shares of common stock, subject to our ability to settle the entire amount in cash. Generally speaking, this would result in the issuance of common stock upon the conversion of the 2.625% Notes, Series B only if our common stock is trading at a value in excess of $10.50 per share and we do not elect to pay the entire amount in cash or are unable to do so. The conversion of some or all of the 2.625% Notes, Series B into common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and may impact the value of our common stock. The 2.625% Notes, Series B will become fully convertible on June 15, 2016. Prior to that date, the 2.625% Notes, Series B will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary events. We may also elect\nto settle the 1.00% Notes in common stock, cash or a combination thereof. For a description of the conversion features of the 1.00% Notes and for other information regarding our convertible notes, see Note 8: \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The dilutive effect of convertible notes on the calculation of our earnings per share is described in Note 9: \u201cEarnings Per Share and Equity\u201d of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Relating to Our Common Stock\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline.\nGiven the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability, and unexpected changes may impact the value of our common stock. A large portion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter. In addition to the other factors described above, factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include:\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of orders from our customers, including cancellations and reschedulings;\n\u2022\nthe timing of introduction of new products;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of significant customers, including as a result of industry consolidation or as a result of our acquisitions;\n\u2022\nseasonality in some of our target markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of products we sell;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand by the end-users of our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our current and future products;\n\u2022\nvariability of our customers\u2019 product life cycles;\n\u2022\navailability of supplies and manufacturing services;\n\u2022\nchanges in manufacturing yields or other factors affecting the cost of goods sold, such as the cost and availability of raw materials and the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nchanges in the prices of our products, which can be affected by the level of our customers\u2019 and end-users\u2019 demand, technological change, product obsolescence, competition or other factors;\n\u2022\ncancellations, changes or delays of deliveries to us by our third-party manufacturers, including as a result of the availability of manufacturing capacity and the proposed terms of manufacturing arrangements;\n\u2022\nour liquidity and access to capital; and\n\u2022\nour research and development activities and the funding thereof.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities.\nThe stock markets in general, and the markets for high technology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, among others, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nthe issuance or repurchase of shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new products or product enhancements;\n\u2022\nloss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nThe trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had significant variance and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price.\nProvisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company, which could decrease the value of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which is preferred stock that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval and that could be issued with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding common stock to amend any of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or by-laws.\nCertain change in control restrictions in certain of our debt agreements may have similar effects. Although we believe these provisions make a higher third-party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.", "PERMNO": 88182, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "ON"}
