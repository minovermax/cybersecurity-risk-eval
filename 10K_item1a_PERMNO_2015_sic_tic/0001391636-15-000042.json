Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe currently generate the majority of our revenue from a concentrated base of customers, including Windstream Corporation. Unless we can substantially expand our sales to other existing or new customers, our period-to-period revenue may be highly volatile and we will not be able to grow our revenue.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, revenue from Windstream represented approximately 29%, 39% and 45% of our total revenue. In recent periods, sales to Windstream have been highly volatile from quarter to quarter. For example, sales to Windstream declined from $19.0 million, or 50% of total revenue, in the third quarter of 2013 to $2.3 million, or 11% of total revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2013 and to $1.1 million, or 6% of total revenue, in the first quarter of 2014. The unanticipated 88% decline in revenue from Windstream from the third to the fourth quarters of 2013 resulted in our overall revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 being substantially lower than we or the market anticipated. In the third quarter of 2014, sales to Windstream decreased to $5.6 million or 21% of total revenue from $6.7 million, or 28% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2014, but increased to $15.8 million or 52% in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nWhile our sales to Windstream have been volatile, and can be potentially highly volatile, from quarter to quarter, we nonetheless anticipate that a significant portion of our revenue in 2015 and beyond will continue to depend on sales to Windstream especially as we have been selected by Windstream for additional upgrades to its regional and metro networks across major markets to 100G capacity. If our sales to Windstream decrease materially in any period, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nDuring 2014 two customers accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue: Windstream, which accounted for approximately 29%, and Colt, which accounted for approximately 11% of our 2014 revenue. During 2013 two customers accounted for greater than 10% of revenue: Windstream, which accounted for approximately 39%, and Telephone and Data Systems, Inc., which accounted for approximately 11% of our 2013 revenue. Given the episodic nature of capital expenditures associated with network deployments, we may continue to derive a substantial amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers in any future period. Unless and until we substantially diversify our customer base, we may continue to experience significant volatility in our quarterly results, and may not be able to maintain or grow our revenues.\nSales of our solutions to our customers, including Windstream, are made pursuant to purchase orders, and not pursuant to long-term, committed-volume purchase contracts. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain or increase sales to any current or future customer from period to period, or that we will be able to offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by these customers with purchases by new or other existing customers. As a consequence of our customer concentration and the frequently concentrated nature of our customers\u2019 purchases, our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict. The loss of, or a significant delay or reduction in purchases by, any of our significant customers has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses in each quarterly and annual period. For the year ended December 31, 2014 we incurred net losses of $59.2 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $186.5 million. Although our revenue grew in each of the years from our inception through the year ended December 31, 2013, our revenue for 2014 fell below the level attained in 2013. Our revenue may not grow, or may decline, in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including uncertain demand for our solutions, increasing competition or our failure to capitalize on potential growth opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses until at least the end of 2015 as we continue to expend substantial resources on sales and marketing, including domestic and international expansion efforts, product and feature development, technology infrastructure and general administration. If we are unable to grow our revenue, improve our gross margin or manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses beyond 2015 and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur revenue, gross margin and other operating results may fluctuate significantly and be unpredictable, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur revenue and operating results may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. The timing and size of orders for our Z-Series and Blue Planet platforms and other solutions have been highly variable and difficult to predict, and we expect similar unpredictability for our N-Series platform, leading to uncertainty and limiting our ability to accurately forecast revenue and resulting in significant fluctuations in revenue from period to period. This variability has been compounded by our customer concentration and the frequently concentrated nature of our customers\u2019 purchases, which are made pursuant to purchase orders and not pursuant to long-term committed-volume purchase contracts.\nIn addition to, or as elaborated in, other risks listed in this Risk Factors section, factors that may affect our operating results include:\n\u2022\nthe timing of orders from our customers and channel partners, including by our largest customer, Windstream;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe capital spending patterns of network operators and any decrease or delay in capital spending by network operators due to economic, regulatory or other reasons;\n\u2022\nthe inherent complexity, seasonality, length and associated unpredictability of our sales cycles for our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe availability to our customers, particularly domestic customers, of government stimulus funding for network expansion activities, including for purchases of network systems such as our Z-Series, N-Series and Blue Planet platforms;\n\u2022\nchanging market conditions, including network operator consolidation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our markets, new market entrants and any related discounting, bundling or financing of products or services;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate incremental business from our expanded international sales and marketing operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs such as the costs of the components for our Z-Series and N-Series platforms;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our contract manufacturer and component suppliers to timely meet our manufacturing and supply needs at acceptable prices, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe timing and execution of product transitions, new product introductions or product upgrades by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe risk that new product announcements may cause existing or prospective customers to delay purchases of existing products pending availability of announced new products prior to such newer products being available for commercial shipment;\n\u2022\nour ability to timely and effectively develop, introduce and gain market acceptance for new solutions, products, technologies and services, such as Blue Planet, and anticipate future market demands that meet our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully expand the Z-Series, N-Series, Blue Planet and professional service solutions we sell to existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe interoperability of our solutions with service providers\u2019 networks and the ability of our Blue Planet solutions to manage the broad range of equipment in such networks;\n\u2022\ntechnical challenges in network operators\u2019 overall networks, unrelated to our solutions, which could delay adoption and installation of our solutions;\n\u2022\ndecisions by potential customers to purchase alternative products and services from other providers and their willingness to deploy our solutions;\n\u2022\nany decision by us to increase or decrease operating expenses in response to changes in the marketplace or perceived marketplace opportunities;\n\u2022\nour ability to derive benefits from our investments in sales, marketing, engineering or other activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to build and manage our channel partner and distribution networks, and the effectiveness of any changes we make to our distribution model; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, both domestically and in international markets.\nAny one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results from period to period.\nThis variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2013 we provided guidance for the fourth quarter that did not meet analyst expectations and in the first quarter of 2014 we announced results for the fourth quarter that fell below our guidance and below analyst expectations, both of which events resulted in sharp declines in our stock price and resultant securities class action litigation. If we fail to meet such expectations in the future, the market price of our common stock could again fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action litigation.\nOur business depends on the capital spending patterns and financial capabilities of our service provider customers, and any decrease or delay in their capital spending may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur revenue to date has been derived primarily from our service provider customers. Demand for our solutions depends on the amount and timing of capital spending by these customers as they construct, expand and upgrade their networks. In response to any future challenging economic conditions and decreased availability of capital, spending for network infrastructure projects could be delayed or cancelled by our customers. In addition, capital spending is cyclical in our industry and sporadic among individual service providers, and can change on short notice. As a result, we may not have visibility into changes in spending behavior until near the end of a given quarter. Further, infrastructure improvements may be further delayed or prevented by a variety of factors, including cost, regulatory obstacles, consolidation in the industry, lack of consumer demand and alternative technologies for service delivery. Specifically, we and many competitors experienced weakness in demand in North America in the third quarter of 2014 as service providers took a cautious approach towards capital spending. While we saw increased service provider revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014, many other industry participants continued to see weakness through the entire second half of 2014. Any reductions in capital expenditures by service providers in any future period could adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nOur revenue may become more volatile due to changes in historical seasonal patterns. We have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenue as a result of our customers\u2019 spending patterns. For example, in years prior to 2013 and again in 2014, we experienced an increase in business activity as we approached December, due at least in part to some of our customers accelerating spending to use remaining capital budgets. Similarly, we have historically experienced a decrease in business activity in our first quarter as some of our customers delay spending until they\nfinalize their capital budgets and project initiatives become clarified. However, these historical patterns may not recur in any given period. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we experienced a decrease in business activity as some of our customers had largely depleted their 2013 capital budgets by the end of the third quarter. In addition, from time to time, customers may place large orders that are unrelated to seasonality but may significantly affect what appear to be seasonal trends.\nFurthermore, we may experience volatility in gross margin in any particular period as a result of factors including product mix sold, large initial deployments as well as other factors including adjustments to warranty accrual, inventory obsolescence charges and the level of revenue experienced in any particular period. Large initial deployments typically involve a lower margin product mix, as initial deployments are generally comprised of thinly configured chassis. As our customers expand their networks after the initial deployments, they typically purchase additional higher-margin line cards. For example, gross margin decreased by 1.5%, from 40.5% to 39.0%, for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by the overall decreased revenue for the quarter which resulted in a higher percentage impact of overhead costs associated with our manufacturing operations. The decrease in gross margin was also impacted by initial network deployments by customers, which typically involve a lower margin product mix. We expect to continue to experience this volatility in gross margin from quarter-to-quarter, which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur cost reduction plans may not produce anticipated benefits and may lead to charges that will adversely affect our results and operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented a cost reduction plan that was designed to reduce our operating expenses. These cost reduction efforts resulted in a restructuring charge of $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, actual costs related to such efforts may exceed the amounts that we previously estimated or we may undertake additional restructuring efforts in the future, leading to additional charges as actual costs are incurred. Reducing our operating expenses will involve, among other things, reducing the number of people we employ. This reduction in personnel may lead to additional voluntary departures and may negatively impact our ability to achieve our near-term business objectives, including our product development and sales efforts, which could adversely affect out results of operations in the near term and our competitiveness in the longer term.\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.\nWe were incorporated in 2006, and began selling our solutions and generating revenue in 2009. Our limited operating history makes financial forecasting and evaluation of our business difficult. Moreover, we compete in markets characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs, evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services. We continue to increase the breadth and scope of our solutions and, correspondingly, the breadth and scope of our operations. For example, in December 2012, we released for general availability our Blue Planet carrier-grade software-defined networking platform. We have limited historical data and have had a relatively limited time period in which to implement and evaluate our business strategies as compared to companies with longer operating histories. As a result, it is difficult to forecast our future revenue growth, if any, and to plan our operating expenses appropriately, which in turn makes it difficult to predict our future operating results. In the course of our development efforts, we may experience design, manufacturing, marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new solutions, services and\nenhancements, any of which could result in lower sales, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe currently generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our Z-Series platforms and therefore a decrease in purchases of these platforms would adversely affect our revenue and our operating results.\nHistorically, our Z-Series platforms have accounted for substantially all of our revenue, and we expect to continue to derive a substantial majority of our revenue from sales of these platforms in the near term. As a result, our future financial performance will depend heavily on our ability to continue to sell existing, and to develop and sell enhanced, versions of our Z-Series platforms as well as our recently introduced N-Series platforms, both to existing and new customers. If current market demand for these products diminishes, or we fail to deliver product enhancements, new releases or new products that customers want, overall demand for our solutions and related services would decrease, and our operating results would be harmed.\nIf the SDN and NFV markets do not develop as we anticipate, or if we are unable to increase market awareness of our company and our solutions within those markets, demand for our Blue Planet solution may not grow, and our future results would be adversely affected.\nFundamental to our solution is our Blue Planet SDN and network functions virtualization NFV platform. As a result, our long-term success will depend to a significant extent on potential customers recognizing the benefits of our solutions over legacy systems and products, and the willingness of service providers and high-performance data center and other network operators to increase their use of SDN and NFV solutions in their networks. The market for SDN and NFV solutions is at an early stage and it is difficult to predict important trends, including the potential growth, if any, of this market.\nIf the market for SDN and NFV solutions does not evolve in the way we anticipate or if customers do not recognize the benefits of our solutions, we likely would not be able to increase sales of our Blue Planet platform. To date, some network operators have been reluctant to switch to SDN and NFV solutions because they have invested substantial resources to maintain and integrate legacy solutions into their networks. These network operators may continue allocating their network budgets to the maintenance and upgrading of their legacy systems and products and therefore not adopt our SDN or NFV solutions in addition to or as a replacement for these legacy systems and products. We also what appear to be delays in service provider purchasing decisions to traditional network equipment, including our Z-Series products, as the service providers pause to evaluate their plans for these technologies.\nEven if the market for SDN and NFV solutions develops as we anticipate, market awareness of our SDN and NFV solutions will be essential to our long-term growth. We cannot assure you that network operators will accept the value proposition that we believe our solutions provide. If we are not successful in creating market awareness of our company and our full suite of SDN and NFV solutions, our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nIf our SDN platform, Blue Planet, or any other new solutions we develop face challenges for market acceptance, our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe initially released Blue Planet in December 2012. Currently, our Blue Planet offering has an unproven revenue model and has accounted for an immaterial amount of our revenue. If network operators do not perceive the benefits of Blue Planet, the market for Blue Planet may not develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would\nadversely affect our revenue growth prospects. The widespread acceptance of Blue Planet will require not only the recognition and adoption of SDN and NFV as a whole over legacy systems and products, but also the adoption of Blue Planet by our current and potential customers to meet their SDN and NFV requirements. We also face the risk of having a limited time to market in order to establish Blue Planet over any alternative solutions or technologies that network operators utilize for SDN, NFV and other network management. In addition, we have limited experience in pricing Blue Planet separately from our Z-Series platforms, which could result in underpricing that adversely affects our expected financial performance, or overpricing that inhibits our customer acceptance of Blue Planet. Moreover, many network equipment providers, including us, provide basic element management software at little or no additional cost to hardware customers. As a result, network operators are not accustomed to paying for software and may not be willing to pay meaningful amounts for such software regardless of the value it creates for them. Even if the initial development and commercial introduction of Blue Planet is successful, we cannot assure you that it will achieve widespread market acceptance or that any market acceptance will be sustainable over the longer term. If Blue Planet does not gain market acceptance at a sufficient rate of growth, our business and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business, operating results and market share.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing customer needs and evolving industry standards. We expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively to meet the demand for existing products as well as innovate to bring new products and solutions to market.\nWe compete either directly or indirectly with large networking and optical companies, such as Alcatel-Lucent SA, Ciena Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., Fujitsu Limited, Huawei Technologies Co. Limited and Juniper Networks, Inc., and specialized technology providers that offer solutions that address a portion of the issues that we address. In addition, we seek to replace legacy network control tools and processes that network operators have either already purchased or internally developed, and potential customers may be reluctant to adopt a solution that replaces or changes existing systems and processes in which they have made significant investments. In the future, in selling Blue Planet we may also compete with companies that are focused on providing virtualization software solutions for other end-markets as they may try to adapt their solutions to meet the needs of network operators or compete with networking companies that develop or acquire SDN or NFV solutions. Some of our competitors have made, or may make, acquisitions of businesses that may allow them to offer solutions that are more directly competitive and comprehensive than those they currently offer.\nWe expect competition and competitive pressure from both new and existing competitors to increase in the future. Additionally, many of our competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, well-established relationships with customers or channel partners in our markets and substantially greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources than we have. Our competitors may be able to anticipate, influence or adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities more readily and develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we can. In addition, competitors with substantially larger installed customer bases may leverage their relationships and incorporate functionality into their existing products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our solutions. These larger competitors may also have more diversified businesses that\nallow them to better withstand significant reductions in capital spending by customers. Moreover, potential customers may also prefer to purchase from their existing providers rather than a new provider, regardless of product performance or features, because our solutions may require additional investment of time and funds to install the solutions and to train operations personnel. In addition, some of our competitors may offer substantial discounts, rebates or financing to win new or retain existing customers, or may bundle different products and services together in a package to their customers where they include products and services that directly compete with our solutions at very low prices or even for free. If we are unable to win customers, or if we are forced to reduce prices in order to secure customers, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving market and if we are unable to develop and introduce new solutions or make enhancements to existing solutions that successfully respond to emerging technological trends and achieve market acceptance, our revenue and growth prospects would likely be adversely affected.\nOur market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing customer needs, evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our future success will depend significantly on our ability to effectively anticipate and timely adapt to such changes, and to develop and offer, on a timely and cost-effective basis, hardware and software solutions with features that meet changing customer demands, technology trends and industry standards. Our solutions have been developed to rely upon open standards for integration and functionality with legacy networks and third-party vendor network equipment and applications, and we cannot assure you that these standards will continue to receive market acceptance. Additionally, such open standard design could make it easier for competitors to more quickly and inexpensively develop and offer their own products and services based on the same technology. If our competitors introduce new products and services that compete with ours, we may be required to reposition our solutions or introduce new solutions in response to such competitive pressure. If we fail to develop new products or product enhancements, or our customers or potential customers do not perceive our solutions to have compelling advantages, our business, revenue and growth prospects would be adversely affected.\nWe intend to continue making significant investments in further developing and enhancing the functionality of our Blue Planet, Z-Series and N-Series platforms. Developing our solutions is expensive, complex and involves uncertainties. We intend to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we may not have sufficient resources to successfully manage these hardware and software development cycles, and these investments may take several years to generate positive returns, if ever.\nThe future growth of our business depends, in significant part, on increasing our international sales, and even if we are successful in expanding internationally, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe currently generate a significant majority of our sales from customers in the United States, and only in 2012 did we begin significant efforts to offer our solutions internationally. We have limited experience managing the sales, support and administrative aspects of a worldwide operation. For the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, revenue from customers outside of the United States was approximately 22% and 9%, respectively. The future growth of our business depends, in significant part, on increasing our international sales. We may not be successful in our efforts to expand our international operations, including as a result of not being able to increase or maintain international market demand for our solutions, and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources. Our failure to\nsuccessfully grow internationally could limit the future growth of our business and, consequently, affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the course of expanding our international operations and operating overseas, we will be subject to a variety of risks, directly and indirectly through our channel partners, including:\n\u2022\nlonger than expected sales cycles;\n\u2022\ninternational trade costs and restrictions, including trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions, affecting our sales;\n\u2022\ntreatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and responsibility for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, data protection, communications and Internet laws and regulations, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory limitations on our ability to sell our solutions in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022\nchallenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, compensation and benefits and compliance programs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in and the potentially high costs of staffing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the potential corresponding adverse impact on our days sales outstanding;\n\u2022\nthe imperative to adapt our solutions to meet the differing standards of one or more other countries;\n\u2022\nthe risk of change in political or economic conditions for foreign countries, and the potential for political unrest, acts of terrorism, hostilities or war;\n\u2022\nlocalization of products and services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u2022\ndiffering laws and business practices, which may favor local competitors;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations and controls; and\n\u2022\nlimited or unfavorable intellectual property protection in foreign jurisdictions.\nEach of these risks could have an adverse effect on our overall business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable investment of time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nOur sales process entails planning discussions with prospective customers, analyzing their existing networks and identifying how these potential customers can leverage our solutions within their networks. The sales cycle for a new customer deployment, from the time of prospect qualification to the completion of the first sale, may span multiple quarters. The sales cycles with larger carriers, potential customers in international markets and customers evaluating shifting from legacy hardware-based solutions to SDN and/or NFV based solutions can be even longer. We spend substantial time, effort and money in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales of our solutions. If we invest substantial resources pursuing unsuccessful sales opportunities, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. In addition, purchases by network operators of our solutions are subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. If sales expected from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter, or at all, we may not achieve our revenue expectations.\nWe engage channel partners to promote, sell, install and support our solutions internationally, and we intend to continue to expand our international channel partner network. Any failure to effectively develop and manage this distribution channel could adversely affect our business, operating results and market share.\nWe engage channel partners who provide sales and support services for our solutions to reach customers outside of the United States. If we do not properly identify, engage and train our channel partners to sell, install and service our solutions, or if a new channel partner is not able to execute on our sales strategy, our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer. The loss of a key channel partner or the failure of a channel partner to provide adequate customer service could have a negative effect on customer satisfaction and could cause harm to our business. Our use of channel partners and other third-party support partners, and the associated risks, are likely to increase as we seek to expand our international sales. Generally, our channel partners do not have long-term contractual commitments or exclusivity to us. We also compete with other network systems providers for our channel partners\u2019 business as many of our channel partners market competing products. If a channel partner promotes a competitor\u2019s products to the detriment of our solutions or otherwise fails to market our solutions effectively, we would lose market share.\nChanges in government-sponsored programs, especially decreases in government funding, could affect the timing and buying patterns of certain of our customers, which would cause reduced sales of our solutions and fluctuations in our operating results.\nOver the past several years, our customer base has included Independent Operating Companies (IOCs) and other telecommunications network providers that benefited from federal and state subsidies. Approximately 13% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, was attributable to sales of our solutions to IOCs and other service providers that used government-supported loan programs or grants to fund purchases from us, such as those originating from the Rural Utility Service (RUS) program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and broadband stimulus programs under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. During 2014, while we recognized revenue as a result of acceptance of earlier stimulus-funded projects, our bookings of new stimulus-related projects were substantially lower than in prior years. While we expect stimulus-related investment to generally increase in 2015 over the 2014 level, there can be no assurance that IOCs that we serve will benefit from such programs or that even if benefiting, their spending will be targeted at the portions of the networks served by our products. To the extent that any of our customers have received grants or loans under these RUS and stimulus programs but no longer have access to such assistance, or to the extent that they are focusing on other elements of their networks, they may substantially reduce or curtail future purchases of our solutions.\nOur business and operations have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we are unable to effectively manage this growth and expansion, or if our business does not continue to grow as we expect, including with respect to our recruitment of qualified personnel, our operating results may suffer.\nWe experienced rapid growth and have significantly expanded our operations since our inception, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our business effectively.\nWe believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify, attract and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel, particularly engineers and sales personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense,\nparticularly for those specializing in network and software engineering and sales, and those located in the San Francisco Bay Area. In addition, our headquarters location in Petaluma, in the northern part of the San Francisco Bay Area, may make it more difficult to attract qualified personnel that live in other parts of the Bay Area. In addition, declines in the trading price of our common stock may make attracting and retaining our employees more difficult given the competitive compensatory environment we face recruiting technology employees in the San Francisco Bay Area. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, or that newly hired personnel will function effectively, both individually and as a group.\nOur ability to manage our operations will further require us to refine our operational, financial and management controls, human resource policies, and reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to efficiently expand our sales force, engineering, operations, IT or financial systems, or otherwise manage our business, our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and we may lose the ability to close customer opportunities, enhance our existing products and services, satisfy customer requirements, respond to competitive pressures or otherwise execute our business plan. These additional investments will increase our operating costs, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls in the short term by reducing expenses. Moreover, if we fail to scale our operations successfully, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe do not have long-term, committed-volume purchase contracts with our customers for our products, and therefore have no guarantee of future revenue from any customer, which may cause our operating results to be adversely affected.\nSales of our Z-Series platforms are made, and we expect sales of our N-Series platforms to be made, pursuant to purchase orders, and we have not entered into long-term, committed-volume purchase contracts with our customers, including our largest customer, Windstream. As a result, any of our customers may cease to purchase our hardware solutions at any time. In addition, our customers may attempt to renegotiate their terms of purchase, including price and quantity, or may delay or cancel already submitted purchase orders. If any of our customers stop purchasing our hardware solutions for any reason, or purchase fewer solutions, our operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nWe currently rely upon a single contract manufacturer to manufacture our hardware solutions, and if we encounter problems with the contract manufacturer, our operations could be disrupted, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships.\nWe contract with Flextronics International, Ltd., or Flextronics, as the sole manufacturer of all of our Z-Series and N-Series platforms. Our reliance on Flextronics makes us vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields and costs. We have limited direct control over the quality and control systems of Flextronics, and therefore may not be able to ensure levels of quality suitable for our customers. The revenue that Flextronics generates from our orders represents a very small percentage of its revenue. As a result, fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority by Flextronics. If Flextronics were unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our Z-Series platforms or commence and maintain manufacturing of our N-Series platforms, in required volumes and at high quality levels, or if Flextronics significantly increased our costs to have them manufacture our products, we would have to identify, qualify and select an acceptable alternative contract manufacturer. Such alternatives may not be available to us when needed, may take a significant amount of time to contract with and establish manufacturing or supply relationships, and may not be in a position to timely satisfy our production requirements at commercially reasonable prices and quality. Any significant interruption in\nmanufacturing would require us to reduce the amount of Z-Series and N-Series platforms available to our customers, which in turn would reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements or manage our inventory with our contract manufacturer, we could incur additional costs, lose revenue and harm our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships.\nThe suppliers of the components used in our Z-Series and N-Series platforms generally deliver the components directly to our contract manufacturer, Flextronics, but we bear the inventory risk under our arrangements with Flextronics. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 we had commitments to Flextronics totaling $9.7 million and $7.9 million, respectively. Lead times for the materials and components that we order through Flextronics vary significantly and depend on numerous factors, including the specific supplier, contract terms and market demand for a component at a given time. The lead times for certain key materials and components could be lengthy depending on overall market demand, requiring us or Flextronics to order materials and components several months in advance of their use in manufacturing our products. If we overestimate our production requirements, Flextronics may purchase excess components and build excess inventory. If Flextronics purchases excess components or builds excess products, we could be required to pay for these excess components or products and recognize related inventory write-down costs. We also are required to reimburse Flextronics if our inventory is rendered obsolete for any reason. If we experience inventory write-downs associated with excess or obsolete inventory in any significant amount, this would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Conversely, if we underestimate our product requirements, our contract manufacturer may maintain inadequate component inventory and be unable to manufacture our Z-Series and N-Series platforms in sufficient quantities to timely meet customer demand. Any shortfall in available products could result in delays or cancellation of orders by our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships.\nCertain component parts used in the manufacture of our products are sourced from single or limited source suppliers. If we are unable to source these components on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships.\nWe depend on certain sole-source and limited source suppliers for key components that Flextronics, our contract manufacturer, uses in the manufacture of our Z-Series and N-Series platforms. Any of the sole-source and limited source suppliers upon whom we rely could stop producing our components, cease operations or be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, our competitors. In particular, our reliance on Broadcom Corporation for certain key semiconductors and other third parties for certain optical components used in our hardware solutions makes us vulnerable to shortages or pricing pressure on these important components. Neither we nor Flextronics generally has long-term supply agreements with component suppliers, and our purchase volumes currently may be considered too low for us to be a priority customer by many of such suppliers. As such, we cannot be guaranteed a continuous source of, or favorable pricing for, components from any of these suppliers. Furthermore, patent infringement lawsuits between semiconductor companies could have an adverse effect on our ability to acquire components that are sole sourced and integrated into our Z-Series and N-Series platforms, leading to production delays and additional engineering costs, potentially harming our business and customer relationships. Any such interruption or delay may force us to seek similar components or products from alternative sources, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Switching suppliers may require that we redesign our Z-Series and/or N-Series\nplatforms to accommodate new components, and to re-qualify these solutions, which would be costly and time-consuming. Any interruption in the supply of sole-source or limited source components for our solutions would adversely affect our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could result in lost revenue or higher expenses, any of which would harm our business, operating results, financial condition and customer relationships.\nOur future success depends in part on revenue from Blue Planet and our other services, and because we generally recognize revenue from Blue Planet over the term of the relevant contractual period, downturns or upturns in sales will not likely be reflected in full in our operating results for the period in which such downturns or upturns occur.\nSales of new or renewed term licenses, support and maintenance contracts, especially with respect to Blue Planet, may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our solutions, the prices of our solutions, the prices of products and services offered by our competitors and reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. If our sales of new or renewals of term licenses, support and maintenance contracts decline, our revenue and revenue growth will decline and our business will suffer. In addition, we generally recognize Blue Planet and service contract revenue ratably over the term of the relevant contractual period. As a result, much of the term license and service revenue that we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from term licenses and service contracts entered into during previous quarters. Accordingly, any decline in new or renewed term licenses or service contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition, it may be difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as Blue Planet revenue is generally recognized over the term of the contract.\nOur solutions are highly complex and may contain undetected hardware errors or software bugs, which could harm our reputation and increase our warranty obligations and service costs.\nOur solutions are highly technical and, when deployed, are critical to the operation of our customers\u2019 networks. Our solutions have from time to time contained and may in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our solutions may only be discovered after a solution has been deployed and used by customers, and may in some cases only be detected under certain circumstances or after extended use. Any errors, bugs, defects or security vulnerabilities discovered in our solutions after commercial release could result in loss of our revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customer goodwill and customer relationships, harm to our reputation and increased service costs, any of which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Quality or performance problems related to our Z-Series or N-Series platforms that are covered under warranty could require us to repair or replace defective products at no additional cost to the customer. For example, in the second quarter of 2013, we experienced higher than expected failure rates with certain Z-Series line cards used by a number of our customers that were manufactured between 2010 and the spring of 2012. After extensive analysis of the root cause, we identified a line card power supply as the source of the failures. We elected to undertake a proactive warranty repair and replacement program for line cards we have determined to be at risk of early failure. While in this instance we were able to negotiate an agreement for the manufacturer of the defective components to reimburse us for a substantial portion of the costs of the repair and replacement program and we believe that our warranty reserve is sufficient to cover expected costs, including any unreimbursed costs, if we experience quality or performance problems in the future related to our Z-Series or N-Series platforms or other products that are covered under warranty, we could be required to repair or replace defective products without the benefit of manufacturer reimbursement, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations. In addition, any errors discovered in Blue Planet could cause\ncustomers and potential customers to abandon or never adopt Blue Planet, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Moreover, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of contract from our customers, or be required to indemnify our customers for damages and third-party claims for a variety of reasons. Any increased costs, liabilities and diversion of resources associated with a warranty or other claim related to errors or alleged errors in our solutions could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur solutions must interoperate with existing legacy and competitor software applications and hardware products found in our customers\u2019 networks. If our solutions do not interoperate properly, future sales of our solutions could be negatively affected, which would harm our business.\nOur solutions must interoperate with our customers\u2019 existing and planned networks, which often have varied and complex specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, software applications and products from multiple vendors and may contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time. Our solutions must communicate, manage and analyze networks and the traffic across these networks, often across differing legacy protocols and technologies. As a result, we have developed and are continuing to develop interfaces that enable our solutions to achieve the desired level of interoperability with these existing and planned networks and network components, including legacy networks that operate on technology originally designed several decades ago. To meet these interoperability requirements, we continuously engage in development efforts that require substantial resources. If we fail to develop or maintain compatibility with other software or equipment included in our customers\u2019 existing and planned networks, our opportunity to sell our solutions may be adversely impacted and we may incur significant warranty, support and repair costs, cause significant customer relations problems and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and our business and operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, if our competitors, whose software or equipment incorporate these protocols and technologies, fail to make available to us on an ongoing basis the interfaces and other information we require to maintain the interoperability of our solutions with their software and equipment, our business and operating results would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with evolving network industry technical requirements and standards, sales of our existing and future solutions would be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nThe markets for our solutions are characterized by a significant number of standards, both domestic and international, which are evolving as new network technologies are deployed. Our solutions must comply with these standards in order to be widely marketable. In some cases and particularly in international markets, we may be required to obtain certifications or authorizations before our solutions can be introduced, marketed or sold in new markets or to new customers. In addition, our ability to expand our international operations and create international market demand for our solutions may be constrained by regulations or standards adopted by other countries that may require us to redesign our existing solutions or develop new products suitable for sale in those countries. We cannot assure you that we will be able to design our solutions to comply with evolving standards and regulations. The cost of complying with evolving standards and regulations, or our failure to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certifications, may prevent us from selling our solutions where such standards or regulations apply, which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nOur ability to sell our solutions is highly dependent on the quality of our support and service offerings, and our failure to offer high quality support and services would have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nOnce our solutions are deployed within our customers\u2019 networks, our customers depend on our support organization to quickly resolve any issues relating to those products. A high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions. If we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our solutions, succeed in helping them quickly resolve post-deployment issues or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability to sell our solutions to existing customers and harm our reputation with potential new customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nUncertain global economic conditions may harm our industry, business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur overall performance depends in large part on global economic conditions which have been challenging in recent periods and may continue to be challenging for the foreseeable future. Global financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or the network industry may harm our business by negatively affecting the demand for networking equipment. The United States, Europe and China have been adversely affected in the recent past, and continue to face economic uncertainty. These conditions can affect the rate of spending on network services, could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our solutions and could delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions. In addition, a prolonged economic downturn could affect the viability of our current business strategy. All of these factors could reduce our revenue and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThird parties may assert that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights, which could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and growth prospects.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity, and litigation related to intellectual property rights, in the technology industry in general and the networking industry in particular. From time to time, our competitors, other third-party developers of technology, non-practicing entities and other third party intellectual property owners, commonly referred to as \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d have and may claim that we are infringing upon their patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights. Regardless of the merit of any such claim, responding to such claims can be time consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses. We cannot assure you that we would be successful in defending against any such claims. In addition, patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time before being published, so we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive inventions covered by our patents or patent applications. Moreover, we cannot be certain that we are not infringing third parties\u2019 patent or other intellectual property rights. An adverse outcome with respect to any intellectual property claim could invalidate our proprietary rights and/or force us to, among other things, do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nobtain from a third party claiming infringement a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nstop manufacturing, selling, or using our solutions that embody the asserted intellectual property and refund to customers all or a portion of the fees related to the purchase or license of such solutions;\n\u2022\npay substantial monetary damages;\n\u2022\nindemnify our customers and/or commercial partners against third-party claims for intellectual property infringement pursuant to indemnification obligations under our contracts, generally without limit;\n\u2022\nexpend significant resources to redesign our solutions that use the infringing technology and to develop or acquire non-infringing technology; or\n\u2022\nrebrand or rename our products and services in a manner that does not infringe third party trademark or other intellectual property rights, which could harm our brand recognition in the marketplace.\nAdditionally, if we offer employment to personnel employed or formerly employed by competitors, we may become subject to claims of unfair hiring practices and/or breaches of confidentiality related to the intellectual property of such competitors, and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims, regardless of their merits. Any of these actions could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and growth prospects.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage our use of \u201copen source\u201d software, our ability to sell our products and services could be harmed, which could result in competitive disadvantages, and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe incorporate open source software code in our proprietary software that is part of both our Z-Series and N-Series infrastructure platforms and our Blue Planet software platform. Use of open source software can lead to greater risks than the use of proprietary or third-party commercial software since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls with respect to origin, functionality or other features of the software. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their products to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code generally available in source code form for limited fees or at no cost. In addition, some customers may seek restrictions on the way in which we utilize open source software in solutions that would be deployed in their networks. Although we monitor our use of open source software, open source license terms may be ambiguous, and many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software in our solutions, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our software, discontinue the sale of certain solutions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with applicable open source licenses, we may be subject to costly claims of intellectual property infringement or demands for the public release of proprietary source code. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position, ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expense to enforce our rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secret laws, copyrights, patents and trademarks, as well as customary contractual provisions. To date we have only five issued U.S. patents, and do not have any patents issued outside the United States. Moreover, our issued patents and the patent applications that we have filed may not cover important aspects of our technology, and may not be enforceable. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open source software and other commercially available software. Furthermore, from time to time, we may enter into development arrangements with third parties where the resulting intellectual property is jointly owned. We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. We also incorporate certain generally available software programs into Blue Planet and our other software solutions pursuant to license agreements with third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims against third parties that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors could offer similar products, potentially harming our business. In some cases, third parties with whom we may jointly own intellectual property rights may be able to use their joint ownership rights to compete with us. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Effective trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent protection may not be available to us in every country in which we provide our solutions. The laws of some foreign countries are not as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in these jurisdictions may be inadequate. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and such monitoring may be insufficient to detect all misappropriation or infringement of our rights. In addition, in some instances, for cost-benefit reasons we may choose not to pursue, or to abandon, applications for certain patents, registered trademarks and other registered intellectual property in particular jurisdictions. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to establish the validity of such rights.\nIf we lose key members of our management or engineering teams or are unable retain executives and employees that we need to support our operations and growth, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our key management, engineering, sales personnel and other employees, many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace. None of our senior management or key technical or sales personnel is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. Moreover, any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time. Many of our key employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of their shares of common stock or stock options or are holding options with exercise prices above the recent trading price of our common stock. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own, or the shares underlying their stock options, have vested or are not viewed as competitive on a compensatory nature. In addition, we do not maintain key man life insurance covering our key personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel may harm our business and operating results.\nOur failure to comply with laws and regulations, including regulations affecting the import or export of products and anti-bribery laws, could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws, and tax laws and regulations.\nIn certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm\nour business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. Any change in laws, regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could negatively affect our ability to sell our solutions and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our recent international expansion creates additional regulatory challenges. Future international shipments of our solutions may require export licenses or export license exceptions. In addition, the import laws of other countries may limit our ability to distribute our solutions, or our customers\u2019 ability to buy and use our solutions, in those countries. Changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our solutions in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our solutions or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries altogether. We expect that our global operations will require us to import and export to and from several countries, resulting in additional compliance obligations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Under these laws, companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. We are expanding to operate in areas of the world, including in conjunction with our channel partners, in which corruption may be more prevalent and in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In addition, network operators in various foreign countries are owned, in whole or in part, by foreign governments or instrumentalities. In such cases, the people with whom we engage in connection with our selling activities may be government officials. We cannot assure you that our employees, channel partners or other agents will not engage in prohibited conduct and render us responsible under the FCPA, the Bribery Act or any similar anti-bribery laws in another jurisdiction. If we are found to be in violation of the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other anti-bribery laws, either due to our nascent compliance system or the acts or omission of our employees, channel partners or other agents, we could suffer criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in telecommunications and Internet laws, regulations, rules and tariffs could impede the growth in network activity or otherwise harm our customers, which could have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nIncreased regulation of telecommunications and Internet network activity or access in the United States or any country in which we do business, particularly those that have the effect of impeding, or lessening the rate of growth in, network activity, could decrease demand for our solutions. New or increased access charges for telecommunications service providers and tariffs on certain communications services could negatively affect our customers\u2019 businesses. Further, many of our customers are subject to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rate regulation of interstate telecommunications services, and are recipients of federal universal service fund payments, which are intended to subsidize telecommunications services in areas that are expensive to serve. In addition, many of our customers are subject to state regulation of intrastate telecommunications services, including rates for such services, and may also receive funding from state universal service funds. Changes in rate regulations or universal service funding rules, either at the federal or state level, could adversely affect such customers\u2019 revenue and capital spending plans. Any adoption of new laws, regulations, rules or tariffs, or changes to existing laws, regulations, rules or tariffs, that negatively affects network activity or growth or otherwise adversely affects the business of our customers could harm our business and operating results. For example, while our business is not directly subject to regulation by the FCC, the FCC\u2019s recent \u201cOpen Internet\u201d or \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d rules may impact the business of our U.S. customers which, in turn, may negatively impact their capital spending, including their purchases from us.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition or a decreased customer base, which could harm our business and operating results.\nConsolidation in the network equipment industry has been common. Some of our competitors have made acquisitions or entered into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive solution than they had offered individually. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry are acquired for a variety of strategic reasons or are unable to continue operations. Consolidation in our industry may result in stronger competitors that may create more compelling product offerings, be able to offer greater pricing flexibility and or terms and conditions of sale, including providing customers with substantial financing, and be better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This would make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs and breadth of technology or product offerings. In addition, companies with which we have strategic partnerships may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. Furthermore, continued industry consolidation may adversely affect customers\u2019 perceptions of the viability of smaller and even medium-sized technology companies such as us and, consequently, customers\u2019 willingness to purchase from such companies.\nIn addition, consolidation of network operators may lead to a reduction in the number of potential customers, with the effect that the loss of any major customer could have a greater effect on operating results than in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants. Consolidation among our customers may also cause delays or reductions in their capital expenditure plans and increased competitive pricing pressures as the number of available customers declines and their relative purchasing power increases in relation to suppliers. Consolidation in the number of potential customers could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\nexpiration of, or detrimental changes in, research and development tax credit laws;\n\u2022\nexpiration or non-utilization of net operating losses;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof; or\n\u2022\nfuture earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rate and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income and sales taxes by the Internal Revenue Service and other foreign and state tax authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research and development tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $108.1 million of federal and $84.1 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2026 for U.S. federal income tax and 2015 for state income tax purposes, and the research tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2027 for federal purposes, but do not expire for California purposes. U.S. federal and state income tax laws limit the amount of these carryforwards we can utilize in any given year upon a greater than 50% cumulative shift of stock ownership over a three-year period, including shifts due to the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into our common stock. We may experience subsequent shifts in our stock ownership and, accordingly, there is a risk that our ability to use our existing carryforwards in the future could be limited and that existing carryforwards would be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities may be negatively affected.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, starting with this annual report for the year ended December 31, 2014 we are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In general, this assessment from year-to-year includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting in compliance with Section 404. We have not identified any material weaknesses for the year ended December 31, 2014. For any given period, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to certify that our internal controls are effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. We will be required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups, or JOBS Act, if we take advantage of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. In addition, any remediation efforts we undertake may be costly and may not be successful or enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future.\nWe may expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, business or technologies which may divert our management\u2019s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions or investments.\nWhile we have not consummated any acquisitions to date, we may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other\nassets in the future. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our product and service offerings, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing, investments in other companies or strategic or joint venture partnership agreements. Acquisitions may disrupt our business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business. The anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized, or we may be exposed to risks or liabilities that were unknown at the time of the acquisition or that are different from those that faced our business prior to the acquisition. Negotiating and consummating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may often be subject to approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close. For one or more of those transactions, we may:\n\u2022\nuse cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022\nincur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;\n\u2022\nissue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n\u2022\nincrease our working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nincur substantial liabilities or large charges, such as impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, at the time of the transaction or for some period long after the transaction;\n\u2022\nencounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company or integrating diverse solutions or business cultures;\n\u2022\nacquire companies with inadequate financial or operational reporting or control environments; and\n\u2022\nbecome subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges.\nWe may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at all, without incurring significant costs, delays or other operating problems that could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by manmade problems such as network security breaches, computer viruses or terrorism.\nOur corporate headquarters, the manufacturing facilities of some of our suppliers, as well as our contract manufacturer\u2019s current manufacturing facility for our Z-Series and N-Series platforms, are all located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a fire or a flood, occurring near our headquarters, or near the facilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturer, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our networks and outside data center, by which we provide our Blue Planet platform, also may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our products. In addition, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war could cause disruptions in our or our customers\u2019 businesses, our suppliers\u2019 and contract manufacturers\u2019 operations or the economy as a whole. We also rely on information technology systems to communicate among our workforce and with third parties. Any disruption to our communications, whether caused by a natural disaster or by manmade problems, such as power disruptions, could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or impede our suppliers\u2019 and contract manufacturer\u2019s ability to timely deliver our solutions and components, the deployment of our solutions and our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Capitalization Matters\nOur share price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nTechnology stocks, including those of companies in the network industry, have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. The relatively small trading volume of our stock has in the past resulted in, and may in the future continue to result in small transactions having a large impact on our stock price. Such fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts, and whether our operating results meet these expectations;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general, and of companies in the network industry in particular;\n\u2022\nnew product or service introductions and market demand for these and our existing solutions;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet investor expectations as a result of the timing of large customer orders;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated developments in our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, internationally or both;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock; or\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel.\nIn addition, if either the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in the network industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. The price of our common stock since our initial public offering (IPO) in May 2013 has been highly volatile and, in April 2014 two law suits alleging violations of securities laws were filed against us, our directors and of our certain executive officers. This and any future shareholder litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business, and this could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf securities analysts cease to publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by any research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. In the event securities or industry analysts cover our company and one or more of these analysts downgrade our stock or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price, and the trading price of the notes, could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price, price of the notes, and trading volume to decline.\nThe concentration of ownership among our existing directors, executive officers and principal stockholders provide them, collectively, with substantial control which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur directors, executive officers and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of our common stock based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, may be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe use a significant amount of capital to meet our business objectives.\nWe require a significant amount of cash resources to operate our business. We used approximately $42.0 million of cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December 31, 2014 for operating activities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors including, among others, fluctuations in revenue, gross margin and operating expenses, as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities. Any future softening in the demand for our products and services may result in higher than anticipated losses in the future and require us to raise additional capital. We may also need to make changes to our operating model and capital expenditures to extend our available resources or we may have to significantly reduce our business activities which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in the markets in which we participate which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations. The indenture related to our 8.0% Convertible Notes Due 2019 includes certain restrictions on additional indebtedness. As a result, our capital raising options are limited. There can be no assurance that we would be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all.\nAs a public company we may be exposed to costly and time consuming securities class action suits.\nAs a public company, we face the risk of shareholder lawsuits, particularly if we experience sharp declines in the price of our common stock. For example, on April 1, 2014 a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, against our company, the members of our Board of Directors, our former Chief Financial Officer and the underwriters of our IPO. On April 30, 2014 a substantially similar lawsuit was filed in the same court against the same defendants. These two lawsuits have been consolidated under the caption Beaver County Employees Retirement Fund, et al. v. Cyan, Inc. et al., Case No. CGC-14-539008. We intend to defend this litigation vigorously. While we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation, defending this litigation-and any other lawsuits filed against us-will require us to expend significant time and money, and will distract management from its primary responsibilities. In addition, as a result of this litigation our director and officer insurance costs have increased significantly and may increase again the next time we renew such policies.\nThe requirements of being a public company subject us to increased costs and may strain our resources.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of The New York Stock\nExchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight will be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We will likely need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these regulations, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards are unsuccessful or differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest of:\n\u2022\nJanuary 1, 2019;\n\u2022\nthe first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue is $1.0 billion or more;\n\u2022\nthe date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or\n\u2022\nthe end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, under the JOBS Act, \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our stock. We currently intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our Board of Directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nrequire that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware be the sole and exclusive forum for various legal actions related to fiduciary and corporate actions under Delaware law; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder and which may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a\npremium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Outstanding 8.0% Convertible Notes Due 2019\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and substantial debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2014, our aggregate principal amount of indebtedness for borrowed money was $50.0 million. Subject to certain conditions and limitations in the indenture, we may also incur additional indebtedness, including secured debt, to meet future financing needs. Our ability to make scheduled interest payments, including, if applicable, interest make-whole payments on, or to repay the principal or conversion value, as applicable of our outstanding convertible notes depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nOur significant level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and substantial debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2014, our aggregate principal amount of indebtedness for borrowed money was $50.0 million. Subject to certain conditions and limitations in the indenture, we may also incur additional indebtedness, including secured debt, to meet future financing needs.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have significant effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, it could among other effects:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including with respect to the notes;\n\u2022\nresult in an event of default if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in the indenture or the related security documents related to the notes and any agreement governing our existing or future indebtedness, if any, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nreduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes because we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nsubject us to increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our existing and future indebtedness, if any, with variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;\n\u2022\nprevent us from raising funds necessary to repay the notes at maturity, purchase notes tendered to us if there is a \u201cfundamental change\u201d or pay the interest make-whole payment that may be due in cash in connection with certain conversions of the notes under the indenture governing the notes;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness or are less highly leveraged and that, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our debt levels or leverage prevent us from exploiting; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nEach of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the notes and our future indebtedness, if any.\nOur ability to make payments with respect to the notes and to satisfy any other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance and our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors affecting our company and industry, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur failure to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals could adversely affect our liquidity and may result in our auditor issuing a \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion, which would question our ability to continue as a going concern and could impair revenue and our ability to raise additional capital.\nThe $50 million in principal amount of 8.0% convertible notes we issued December 2014 would be convertible into an aggregate of approximately 20.47 million shares of our common stock. The related warrants represent the right to purchase an additional 11.25 million shares of our common stock. Under applicable New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, rules unless we obtain stockholder approval we will only be permitted to issue an aggregate of approximately 9.4 million shares of common stock to settle the conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants. This limitation represents 19.99% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on the day the note offering was priced. Unless and until we have stockholder approval to issue the full number of shares issuable on conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants, (i) we will be required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the notes by delivering a combination of cash and shares of our common stock with a specified dollar amount per $1,000 principal amount of notes of at least $1,000 for all notes submitted for conversion, and (ii) if the number of shares of common stock deliverable for the settlement amount in excess of the specified dollar amount would result in the issuance of shares in excess of the conversion share cap, then we will pay cash in lieu of the shares that otherwise would have been deliverable. Of the $50 million in principal amount of notes issued, $17 million in principal amount were issued to affiliates. Unless and until we have obtained the requisite stockholder approvals, conversions of affiliate notes will be required to be settled entirely in cash. With respect to our outstanding warrants, unless and until we have obtained the requisite stockholder approvals, we will be required to cash settle any exercises of warrants determined according to the formula set forth in the warrants. Moreover, because the cash settlement amount of the notes and warrants increases if our stock price increases, increases in our stock price would result in an increase in the amount we would have to pay upon conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants. For example, prior to obtaining stockholder approval-or if we don\u2019t obtain stockholder approval if the price of our common stock used for purposes of measuring the settlement amount of the notes and warrants were $4.00 per share, we would be obligated to issue approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock and pay cash of approximately $65.1 million to settle full conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants. . If the\nprice of our common stock used for these calculations were $5.00 per share, the amounts would be approximately 6.9 million shares and $83.3 million in cash.\nAs a result, if we do not receive the requisite stockholder approvals, we will require a substantial amount of cash to settle the conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants which we may not have, and we may not be able to secure financing to meet these obligations.\nIn addition, if we do not obtain the requisite stockholder approvals, our independent certified public accountant could issue a \u201cgoing concern\u201d qualified opinion given the potential for the cash settlement obligations related to the notes and warrants exceeding our available resources. A \"going concern\" opinion could impair our ability to raise funds and may adversely impact our revenue and business if customers delay or discontinue purchases from us due to concerns about our viability. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the requisite stockholder approvals.\nThe indenture governing the notes contains restrictions that limit our operating flexibility, and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions.\nThe indenture governing the notes contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our and our existing and future subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take specific actions, even if we believe them to be in our best interest. These covenants include restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred stock; and\n\u2022\nlimit the transfer of intellectual property to non-subsidiary guarantors.\nIn addition, the related security documents impose restrictions on our ability to incur liens, other than permitted liens. These covenants and restrictions limit our operational flexibility and could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise, growing our business or competing effectively.\nA breach of any of these covenants or other provisions in our debt agreements could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the notes or such debt becoming immediately due and payable. This, in turn, could cause any of our other debt to become due and payable as a result of cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions contained in the agreements governing such other debt. In the event that some or all of our debt is accelerated and becomes immediately due and payable, we may not have the funds to repay, or the ability to refinance, such debt.\nThe accounting method for the notes and the warrants could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUpon stockholder approval to issue the full number of shares issuable on conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants, the notes will be subject to Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. ASC 470-20 requires the liability component to be initially recognized in an amount equal to the fair value of similar nonconvertible debt and the difference between the proceeds of the convertible debt and the value allocated to the liability component is recorded as the initial carrying amount of the equity component (i.e., the conversion option). The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the notes will be that the equity component would be required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component will be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the\namortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 would require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.\nIn addition, prior to our receipt of the requisite stockholder approvals, we will be required to cash or partially cash settle conversions of the notes and cash settle exercises of the warrants. As a result, we will be required to account for the conversion option embedded in the notes and the warrants (and any interest make-whole payment) as derivatives, meaning we will be recording gain or loss on a quarterly basis with regard to the mark-to-market value of those securities. This accounting treatment could have a material impact on, and could result in significant volatility in, our quarterly results of operations.\nUnder certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partly in cash (as the notes will be) may be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of such convertible debt instruments are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such convertible debt instruments exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. However, we cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit our use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. In addition, we will in certain circumstances make an interest make-whole payment to converting holders payable in cash prior to our receipt of the requisite stockholder approvals and payable in cash or shares of our common stock at our election following the requisite stockholder approvals. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes prior to our receipt of the requisite stockholder approvals, (i) with respect to notes other than affiliate notes, we will be required to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering a combination of cash and shares of our common stock with a specified dollar amount per $1,000 principal amount of notes of at least $1,000 for all notes submitted for conversion and (ii) with respect to affiliate notes, we will be required to pay cash for the settlement amount of all affiliate notes submitted for conversion, and pay any applicable interest make-whole payment through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Once we have obtained the requisite stockholder approvals, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share) and pay any applicable interest make-whole payment in shares of our common stock, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation and the interest make-whole payment, if applicable, through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which may result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nSubject to certain conditions and limitations, the indenture governing the notes permits us to incur a certain amount of additional indebtedness, including secured debt, and does not require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity; if we incur substantial additional indebtedness it may adversely affect our ability to make payments on the notes.\nSubject to certain conditions and limitations, the indenture governing the notes will permit us to incur a certain amount of additional indebtedness, including secured debt, and will not require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. We and our future and existing subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. If we incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, these higher levels of indebtedness may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on the notes, or any fundamental change purchase price or any cash due upon conversion, and our creditworthiness generally.\nWe may not be permitted, by the agreements governing our future indebtedness, to pay any interest make-whole payment upon conversion of the notes in cash, requiring us to issue shares for such amounts, which could result in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nOn or after January 15, 2016, if, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending within five trading days prior to a conversion date, the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeds the applicable conversion price on each such trading day, we will in addition to certain consideration paid under the notes, pay any converting holder an interest make-whole payment in cash or common stock for the notes being converted. Prior to receipt of the requisite stockholder approvals, we must pay any interest make-whole in cash. After receipt of the requisite stockholder approvals, we will have the option to issue our common stock to any converting holder in lieu of making the interest make-whole payment in cash. If we elect to issue our common stock for such payment, then the stock will be valued at 95% of the simple average of the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock for the 10 trading days ending on and including the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date. Agreements governing our future indebtedness may prohibit us from making cash payments in respect of the interest make-whole amount upon a conversion.\nWe may not have the ability to repay the principal amount of the notes at maturity, to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the notes or to purchase the notes upon a fundamental change, and instruments governing our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or purchase of the notes.\nAt maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of the notes will become due and payable by us. Holders of the notes will also have the right to require us to purchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, unless we have obtained the requisite stockholder approvals and elected to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repay the principal amount of the notes, make purchases of notes surrendered therefor or settle conversions of the notes.\nIn addition, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repay the principal amount of the notes, purchase notes at a time when the purchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the\nnotes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness including the Loan and Security Agreement. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nThe fundamental change purchase rights, which will allow holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture relating to the notes, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nWe expect that the trading price of the notes will be significantly affected by the market price of our common stock, which may be volatile, as well as the general level of interest rates and our credit quality.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this section or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability. A decrease in the market price of our common stock would likely adversely impact the trading price of the notes. The market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock. This trading activity could, in turn, affect the trading prices of the notes.\nWe also cannot predict whether interest rates will rise or fall. During the term of the notes, interest rates will be influenced by a number of factors, most of which are beyond our control. Interest rate movements may adversely affect the value of the embedded conversion option and the trading price of the notes.\nIn addition, our credit quality may vary substantially during the term of the notes and will be influenced by a number of factors, including variations in our cash flows and the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding. Any decrease in our credit quality would likely negatively impact the trading price of the notes.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of the notes.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, restricted stock units and other equity awards, in connection with certain deferred purchase price obligations, and upon conversion of the notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock.
