{"cik": "1349437", "company": "TOWERSTREAM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this annual report, including our financial statements and related notes before purchasing shares of our common stock. There are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition\nIf we chose to raise additional capital, we may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our operations on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nIf we choose to raise additional funds in the future, there can be no assurance that sufficient debt or equity financing will be available at all or, if available, that such financing will be at terms and conditions acceptable to us. Should we fail to obtain additional debt financing or raise additional capital, we may not be able to achieve our longer term business objectives and may face other serious adverse consequences. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, investors may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and the newly-issued securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our Common Stock. If we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operational flexibility and may require us to provide collateral to secure the loan. In addition, in a liquidation, debtholders will be entitled to repayment before any proceeds can be paid to our stockholders.\nWe are required to obtain the consent of a certain existing investor to future financings through November 8, 2017, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nUntil November 8, 2017, without the prior written consent of the holder of our Series D and Series F Convertible Preferred Stock, so long as it owns a total of 2,000 shares of Series D and Series F Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company shall not issue any Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock (or modify any of the foregoing which may be outstanding) to any person or entity.\nIn order to obtain this investor's consent for any future offerings, the Company may be required for future financings to provide them with concessions on terms that are unfavorable to the Company and there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain this investor's consent at all. If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital, the Company may need to curtail or cease its operations and implement a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future.\nOur net losses for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $20,436,496 and $40,482,802, respectively. We cannot anticipate when, if ever, our operations will become profitable. We expect to incur significant net losses as we develop our network, expand our markets, undertake acquisitions, acquire spectrum licenses and pursue our business strategy. We intend to invest significantly in our business before we expect cash flow from operations to be adequate to cover our operating expenses. If we are unable to execute our business strategy and grow our business, either as a result of the risks identified in this section or for any other reason, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nCash and cash equivalents represent one of our largest assets and we may be at risk of being uninsured for a large portion of such assets.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $12.3 million in cash and cash equivalents with one large financial banking institution. At times, our cash and cash equivalents may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insurance limits. If the institution at which we have placed our funds were to become insolvent or fail, we could be at risk for losing a substantial portion of our cash deposits, or incur significant time delays in obtaining access to such funds. In light of the limited amount of federal insurance for deposits, even if we were to spread our cash assets among several institutions, we would remain at risk for the amount not covered by insurance.\nOur growth may be slowed if we do not have sufficient capital.\nThe continued growth and operation of our business may require additional funding for working capital, debt service, the enhancement and upgrade of our network, the build-out of infrastructure to expand our coverage, possible acquisitions and possible bids to acquire spectrum licenses. We may be unable to secure such funding when needed in adequate amounts or on acceptable terms, if at all. To execute our business strategy, we may issue additional equity securities in public or private offerings, potentially at a price lower than the market price at the time of such issuance. Similarly, we may seek debt financing and may be forced to incur significant interest expense. If we cannot secure sufficient funding, we may be forced to forego strategic opportunities or delay, scale back or eliminate network deployments, operations, acquisitions, spectrum bids and other investments.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $12.3 million and working capital of approximately $8.9 million. The Company has incurred significant operating losses since inception and continues to generate losses from operations and as of December 31, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $176.7 million. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date these financial statements are issued. Management has also evaluated the significance of these conditions in relation to the Company's ability to meet its obligations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, describing the existence of substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nHistorically, the Company has financed its operation through private and public placement of equity securities, as well as debt financing and capital leases. The Company\u2019s ability to fund its longer term cash requirements is subject to multiple risks, many of which are beyond its control. The Company intends to raise additional capital, either through debt or equity financings or through the potential sale of the Company\u2019s assets in order to achieve its business plan objectives. Management believes that it can be successful in obtaining additional capital; however, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to do so. There is no assurance that any funds raised will be sufficient to enable the Company to attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful, the Company may need to curtail or cease its operations and implement a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.\nOur Chief Financial Officer is not required to work exclusively for us, which could materially and adversely affect us and our business.\nFrederick Larcombe, our Chief Financial Officer, is not required to work exclusively for us and does not devote all of his time to our operations. Since the start of his employment, he has devoted approximately 50 hours a week of his time to the operation of our business. He also serves as Chief Financial Officer of Rittenhouse Foods, Inc. (a privately owned food distribution company) and InterCore, Inc. (OTCPink: ICOR) (a publicly-held developer of software to monitor fatigue) and provides financial services to other companies. It is possible that his pursuit of other activities may slow our operations and impact our ability to timely complete our financial statements.\nRisks Relating to Fixed Wireless Services\nWe may be unable to successfully execute any of our current or future business strategies.\nIn order to pursue business strategies, we will need to continue to build our infrastructure and strengthen our operational capabilities. Our ability to do these successfully could be affected by any one or more of the following factors:\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our equipment, our equipment suppliers or our service providers to perform as we expect;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our services to achieve market acceptance;\n\u25cf\nour ability to manage third party relationships effectively;\n\u25cf\nour ability to identify suitable locations and then negotiate acceptable agreements with building owners so that we can establish PoPs on their rooftops;\n\u25cf\nour ability to work effectively with new customers to secure approval from their landlord to install our equipment;\n\u25cf\nour ability to effectively manage the growth and expansion of our business operations without incurring excessive costs, high employee turnover or damage to customer relationships;\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially individuals experienced in network operations and engineering;\n\u25cf\nequipment failure or interruption of service which could adversely affect our reputation and our relations with our customers;\n\u25cf\nour ability to accurately predict and respond to the rapid technological changes in our industry; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to raise additional capital to fund our growth and to support our operations until we reach profitability.\nOur failure to adequately address any one or more of the above factors could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to execute our business strategy and the long-term viability of our business.\nWe depend on the continued availability of leases and licenses for our communications equipment.\nWe have constructed proprietary networks in each of the markets we serve by installing antennae on rooftops, cellular towers and other structures pursuant to lease or license agreements to send and receive wireless signals necessary for the operation of our network. We typically seek initial five-year terms for our leases with three to five-year renewal options. Such renewal options are generally exercisable at our discretion before the expiration of the current term. If these leases are terminated or if the owners of these structures are unwilling to continue to enter into leases or licenses with us in the future, we would be forced to seek alternative arrangements with other providers. If we are unable to continue to obtain or renew such leases on satisfactory terms, our business would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain customers if we do not maintain and enhance our brand.\nWe believe that our brand is critical part to our success. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments with no assurance that these investments will be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain the \u201cTowerstream\u201d brand, or if we incur significant expenses in this effort, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. We anticipate that maintaining and enhancing our brand will become increasingly important, difficult and expensive and we may not be able to do so.\nMany of our competitors are better established and have significantly greater resources which may make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers.\nThe market for broadband and related services is highly competitive, and we compete with several other companies within each of our markets. Many of our competitors are well established with larger and better developed networks and support systems, longer relationships with customers and suppliers, greater name recognition and greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. Our competitors may subsidize competing services with revenue from other sources and, thus, may offer their products and services at prices lower than ours. Our competitors may also reduce the prices of their services significantly or may offer broadband connectivity packaged with other products or services. We may not be able to reduce our prices or otherwise combine our services with other products or services which may make it more difficult to attract and retain customers. In addition, businesses which are presently focused on providing services to residential customers may expand their target base and begin offering service to business customers.\nWe expect existing and prospective competitors to adopt technologies or business plans similar to ours, or seek other means to develop competitive services, particularly if our services prove to be attractive in our target markets. This competition may make it difficult to attract new customers and retain existing customers.\nWe may experience difficulties constructing, upgrading and maintaining our network which could increase customer turnover and reduce our revenues.\nOur success depends on developing and providing products and services that provide customers with high quality Internet connectivity. If the number of customers using our network increases, we will require more infrastructure and network resources to maintain the quality of our services. Consequently, we may be required to make substantial investments to improve our facilities and equipment, and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure. If we do not complete these improvements successfully, or if we experience inefficiencies, operational failures or unforeseen costs during implementation, the quality of our products and services could decline.\nWe may experience quality deficiencies, cost overruns and delays in implementing network improvements and completing maintenance and upgrade projects. Portions of these projects may not be within our control or the control of our contractors. Our network requires the receipt of permits and approvals from numerous governmental bodies. Such bodies often limit the expansion of transmission towers and other construction necessary for our business. Failure to receive approvals in a timely fashion can delay system rollouts and raise the cost of completing projects. In addition, we are typically required to obtain rights from land, building or tower owners to install antennae and other equipment to provide service to our customers. We may not be able to obtain, on terms acceptable to us, or at all, the rights necessary to construct our network and expand our services.\nWe also face challenges in managing and operating our network. These challenges include operating, maintaining and upgrading network and customer premise equipment to accommodate increased traffic or technological advances, and managing the sales, advertising, customer support, billing and collection functions of our business while providing reliable network service at expected speeds and quality. Our failure in any of these areas could adversely affect customer satisfaction, increase customer turnover or churn, increase our costs and decrease our revenues.\nWe may be unable to operate in certain markets if we are unable to obtain and maintain rights to use licensed spectrum.\nWe provide our services in some markets by using spectrum obtained through licenses or long-term leases. Obtaining licensed spectrum can be a long and difficult process that can be costly and require substantial management resources. Securing licensed spectrum may subject us to increased operational costs, greater regulatory scrutiny and arbitrary government decision making and we may be unable to secure such licensed spectrum.\nLicensed spectrum, whether owned or leased, poses additional risks, including:\n\u25cf\ninability to satisfy build-out or service deployment requirements upon which spectrum licenses or leases may be conditioned;\n\u25cf\nincreases in spectrum acquisition costs or complexity;\n\u25cf\ncompetitive bids, pre-bid qualifications and post-bid requirements for spectrum acquisitions, in which we may not be successful leading to, among other things, increased competition;\n\u25cf\nadverse changes to regulations governing spectrum rights;\n\u25cf\nthe risk that acquired or leased spectrum will not be commercially usable or free of damaging interference from licensed or unlicensed operators in the licensed or adjacent bands;\n\u25cf\ncontractual disputes with, or the bankruptcy or other reorganization of, the license holders which could adversely affect control over the spectrum;\n\u25cf\nfailure of the FCC or other regulators to renew spectrum licenses as they expire; and\n\u25cf\ninvalidation of authorization to use all or a significant portion of our spectrum.\nWe utilize unlicensed spectrum in all of our markets which is subject to intense competition, low barriers of entry and slowdowns due to multiple users.\nWe presently utilize unlicensed spectrum in all of our markets to provide our service offerings. Unlicensed or \u201cfree\u201d spectrum is available to multiple users and may suffer bandwidth limitations, interference and slowdowns if the number of users exceeds traffic capacity. The availability of unlicensed spectrum is not unlimited and others do not need to obtain permits or licenses to utilize the same unlicensed spectrum that we currently utilize or may utilize in the future. The inherent limitations of unlicensed spectrum could potentially threaten our ability to reliably deliver our services. Moreover, the prevalence of unlicensed spectrum creates low barriers of entry in our industry which naturally creates the potential for increased competition.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to provide services which could damage our reputation.\nOur services depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. We have experienced service interruptions in the past and may experience service interruptions or system failures in the future. Any unscheduled service interruption adversely affects our ability to operate our business and could result in an immediate loss of revenues and adversely impact our operating results. If we experience frequent or persistent system or network failures, our reputation could be permanently harmed. We may need to make significant capital expenditures to increase the reliability of our systems, however, these capital expenditures may not achieve the results we expect.\nExcessive customer churn may adversely affect our financial performance by slowing customer growth, increasing costs and reducing revenues.\nThe successful implementation of our business plan depends upon controlling customer churn. Customer churn is a measure of customers who cancel their services agreement. Customer churn could increase as a result of:\n\u25cf\ninterruptions to the delivery of services to customers over our network;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of competing technology such as cable modems, DSL, third-generation cellular, satellite, wireless Internet service and other emerging technologies, some of which may be less expensive or technologically superior to those offered by us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in promotions and new marketing or sales initiatives;\n\u25cf\nnew competitors entering the markets in which we offer service;\n\u25cf\na reduction in the quality of our customer service billing errors;\n\u25cf\na change in our fee structure: and\n\u25cf\nexisting competitors whose services may be less expensive.\nAn increase in customer churn can lead to slower customer growth, increased costs and a reduction in our revenues.\nIf our business strategy is unsuccessful, we will not be profitable and our stockholders could lose their investment.\nMany fixed wireless companies have failed and there is no guarantee that our strategy will be successful or profitable. If our strategy is unsuccessful, the value of our company may decrease and our stockholders could lose their entire investment.\nWe may not be able to effectively control and manage our growth which would negatively impact our operations.\nIf our business and markets continue to grow and develop, it will be necessary for us to finance and manage expansion in an orderly fashion. In addition, we may face challenges in managing expanding product and service offerings, and in integrating acquired increased demands could interrupt or adversely affect our operations and cause backlogs and administrative inefficiencies. businesses discussed below. Such events would increase demands on our existing management, workforce and facilities. Failure to satisfy\nThe success of our business depends on the contributions of key personnel and our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the continued services of our key personnel across all facets of operations. We do not have an employment agreement with any of these individuals except for our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer. We cannot guarantee that any of these persons will stay with us for any definite period. Loss of the services of any of these individuals could adversely impact our operations. We do not maintain policies of \"key man\" insurance on our executives.\nIn addition, we must be able to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled and experienced technical employees in order to successfully introduce our services in new markets and grow our business in existing markets. Qualified technical employees often are in great demand and may be unavailable in the time frame required to satisfy our business requirements. We may not be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled technical employees in the future. The loss of technical personnel or our inability to hire or retain sufficient technical personnel at competitive rates of compensation could impair our ability to grow our business and retain our existing customer base.\nWe may pursue acquisitions that we believe complement our existing operations but which involve risks that could adversely affect our business.\nAcquisitions involve risks that could adversely affect our business including the diversion of management time and focus from operations and difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies. In addition, any future acquisition could result in significant costs, the incurrence of additional debt to fund the acquisition, and the assumption of contingent or undisclosed liabilities, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with any future acquisition, we generally will seek to minimize the impact of contingent and undisclosed liabilities by obtaining indemnities and warranties from the seller. However, these indemnities and warranties, if obtained, may not fully cover the liabilities due to their limited scope, amount or duration, as well as the financial limitations of the indemnitor or warrantor.\nWe may continue to consider strategic acquisitions, some of which may be larger than those previously completed and which could be material transactions. Integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management. Delays or other operational or financial problems that interfere with our operations may result. If we fail to implement proper overall business controls for companies or assets we acquire or fail to successfully integrate these acquired companies or assets in our processes, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, it is possible that we may incur significant expenses in the evaluation and pursuit of potential acquisitions that may not be successfully completed.\nWe could encounter difficulties integrating acquisitions which could result in substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties.\nSince 2010, we have completed five acquisitions. We may seek to acquire other fixed wireless businesses, including those operating in our current business markets or those operating in other geographic markets. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts and the associated capital commitments that might be required. We expect to encounter competition for acquisitions which may limit the number of potential acquisition opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices. We may not be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate acquired businesses, if any, without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties.\nIn addition, such acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including:\n\u25cf\nfailure to obtain regulatory approval for such acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nfailure of the acquired businesses to achieve expected results;\n\u25cf\nintegration difficulties could increase customer churn and negatively affect our reputation;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention and resources to acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nfailure to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\ndisappointing quality or functionality of acquired equipment and personnel; and\n\u25cf\nrisks associated with unanticipated events, liabilities or contingencies.\nThe inability to successfully integrate and manage acquired companies could result in the incurrence of substantial costs to address the problems and issues encountered.\nOur inability to finance acquisitions could impair the growth and expansion of our business.\nThe extent to which we will be able or willing to use shares of our Common Stock to consummate acquisitions will depend on (i) the market value of our securities which will vary, (ii) liquidity which can fluctuate, and (iii) the willingness of potential sellers to accept shares of our Common Stock as full or partial payment. Using shares of our Common Stock for acquisitions may result in significant dilution to existing stockholders. To the extent that we are unable to use Common Stock to make future acquisitions, our ability to grow through acquisitions may be limited by the extent to which we are able to raise capital through debt or equity financings. We may not be able to obtain the necessary capital to finance any acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms, we may be required to reduce the scope of expansion or redirect resources committed to internal purposes. Our inability to use shares of our Common Stock to make future acquisitions may hinder our ability to actively pursue our acquisition program.\nWe rely on a limited number of third party suppliers that manufacture network equipment, and install and maintain our network sites.\nWe depend on a limited number of third party suppliers to produce and deliver products required for our networks. If these companies fail to perform or experience delays, shortages or increased demand for their products or services, we may face a shortage of components, increased costs, and may be required to suspend our network deployment and our service introduction. We also depend on a limited number of third parties to install and maintain our network facilities. We do not maintain any long-term supply contracts with these manufacturers. If a manufacturer or other provider does not satisfy our requirements, or if we lose a manufacturer or any other significant provider, we may have insufficient network equipment for delivery to customers and for installation or maintenance of our infrastructure. Such developments could force us to suspend the deployment of our network and the installation of new customers thus impairing future growth.\nCustomers may perceive that our network is not secure if our data security controls are breached which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and expose us to liability.\nNetwork security and the authentication of a customer\u2019s credentials are designed to protect unauthorized access to data on our network. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate preventive measures against unauthorized access or sabotage. Consequently, unauthorized parties may overcome our encryption and security systems, and obtain access to data on our network. In addition, because we operate and control our network and our customers\u2019 Internet connectivity, unauthorized access or sabotage of our network could result in damage to our network and to the computers or other devices used by our customers. An actual or perceived breach of network security, regardless of whether the breach is our fault, could harm public perception of the effectiveness of our security controls, adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, expose us to significant liability and adversely affect our business prospects.\nThe delivery of our services could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others which may result in costly litigation, substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our services.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us. We may have to pay substantial damages, including for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our services infringe a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. Further, we may be prohibited from selling or providing some of our services before we obtain additional licenses, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties or licensing fees. Even if claims are determined to be without merit, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention from our other business concerns. Any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our business to be harmed and our stock price to decline.\nRisks Relating to Discontinued Operations\nWe may incur additional charges in connection with our decision to exit the shared wireless infrastructure business, and any additional costs would adversely impact our cash flows.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined to exit the shared wireless infrastructure business and curtailed activity in our smaller markets. In connection with this decision, we recognized charges in the fourth quarter of 2015 aggregating approximately $5,359,000, consisting of approximately $3,284,000 of estimated cost to settle our lease obligations, $1,618,000 to write-off network assets which could not be redeployed into the fixed wireless network and writing off $456,000 of deferred acquisition costs and security deposits which are not expected to be recovered.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, we sold the majority of network locations in New York City, our largest market, to a major cable company. We also determined that we would not be able to sell the remaining network locations in New York City. As a result, we recognized charges totaling $1,585,319 in the first quarter of 2016 which included $453,403 representing the estimated cost to settle lease obligations, $528,364 to write off network assets which could not be redeployed into the fixed wireless network, $110,500 related to security deposits which are not expected to be recovered, and $493,052 related to the accelerated expensing of deferred acquisition costs. These costs were partially offset by a $1,244,284 reduction in the accrual for terminated lease obligations that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. This reduction reflects the outcome of settlements negotiated in the first quarter of 2016 with certain landlords. As of December 31, 2016, and based upon negotiations, settlements, and experiences through that date, the Company had reduced that remaining estimated liability by $1,557,626 to $1,240,000 and reduced operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 by the same amount.\nWe believe that we have recognized principally all of the costs required to exit this business but can provide no assurance that additional costs will not be incurred. Any additional costs would adversely impact our operating results and cash flows, and our stock price could decline.\nRisks Relating to the Wireless Industry\nAn economic or industry slowdown may materially and adversely affect our business.\nSlowdowns in the economy or in the wireless or broadband industry may impact demand for our services. Customers may reduce the amount of bandwidth that they purchase from us during economic downturns which will directly affect our revenues and operating results. An economic or industry slowdown may cause other businesses or industries to delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies, including wireless broadband services. Further, political uncertainties, including acts of terrorism and other unforeseen events, may impose additional risks upon and adversely affect the wireless or broadband industry generally, and our business, specifically.\nWe operate in an evolving industry which makes it difficult to forecast our future prospects as our services may become obsolete and we may not be able to develop competitive products or services on a timely basis or at all.\nThe broadband and wireless services industries are characterized by rapid technological change, competitive pricing, frequent new service introductions, and evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements. We believe that our success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these challenges, and to offer competitive services on a timely basis. We face a number of difficulties and uncertainties such as:\n\u25cf\ncompetition from service providers using more efficient, less expensive technologies including products not yet invented or developed;\n\u25cf\nresponding successfully to advances in competing technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u25cf\nmigration toward standards-based technology which may require substantial capital expenditures; and\n\u25cf\nexisting, proposed or undeveloped technologies that may render our wireless broadband services less profitable or obsolete.\nAs the services offered by us and our competitors develop, businesses and consumers may not accept our services as a commercially viable alternative to other means of delivering wireless broadband services. As a result, our services may become obsolete and we may be unable to develop competitive products or services on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities.\nOur business activities, including the acquisition, lease, maintenance and use of spectrum licenses, are extensively regulated by federal, state and local governmental authorities. A number of federal, state and local privacy, security, and consumer laws also apply to our business. These regulations and their application are subject to continuous change as new legislation, regulations or amendments to existing regulations are periodically implemented by governmental or regulatory authorities, including as a result of judicial interpretations of such laws and regulations. Current regulations directly affect the breadth of services we are able to offer and may impact the rates, terms and conditions of our services. Regulation of companies that offer competing services such as cable and DSL providers, and telecommunications carriers also affects our business. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, both monetary and nonmonetary, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOn February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an Open Internet order in which fixed and mobile broadband services is reclassified as telecommunications services governed by Title II of the Communications Act. This reclassification includes forbearance from applying many sections of the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s rules to broadband service providers. As part of the Title II reclassification, the FCC could adopt new regulations requiring broadband service providers to register and pay Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) fees as well as submit to a significant amount of other common carrier regulations.\nThe Open Internet order also adopted rules prohibiting broadband service providers from: (1) blocking access to legal content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; (2) impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on its basis, content, applications or services; or (3) favoring certain Internet traffic over other traffic in exchange for consideration. Depending on how the Open Internet rules are implemented, the Open Internet order could limit our ability to manage customers\u2019 use of our networks, thereby limiting our ability to prevent or address customers\u2019 excessive bandwidth demands. To maintain the quality of our network and user experience, we may manage the bandwidth used by our customers\u2019 applications, in part by restricting the types of applications that may be used over our network. The FCC Open Internet regulations may constrain our ability to employ bandwidth management practices. Excessive use of bandwidth-intensive applications would likely reduce the quality of our services for all customers. Such decline in the quality of our services could harm our business.\nThe breach of a license or applicable law, even if accidentally, can result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of a license or the imposition of fines. In addition, regulatory authorities may grant new licenses to third parties, resulting in greater competition in territories where we already have rights to licensed spectrum. In order to promote competition, licenses may also require that third parties be granted access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or services. We may not be able to obtain or retain any required license, and we may not be able to renew a license on favorable terms, or at all.\nWireless broadband services may become subject to greater state or federal regulation in the future. The scope of the regulations that may apply to companies like us and the impact of such regulations on our competitive position are presently unknown and could be detrimental to our business and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Secured Indebtedness\nOur cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to meet minimum balance requirements or to make required payments on our secured indebtedness, which is secured by substantially all of our assets.\nIn October 2014, we entered into a loan agreement which provided us with a five-year $35,000,000 term loan. As of December 31, 2016, we had $33,290,995 of principal and interest outstanding under the terms of this loan. We have agreed to maintain a minimum balance of cash or cash equivalents equal to or greater than $6,500,000 at all times throughout the term of the loan. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $12,272,444 in cash and cash equivalents with one large financing banking institution. The loan bears interest payable in cash at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the sum of the one month LIBOR rate on each payment date plus 7% or (ii) 8% per annum, and additional paid in kind (\u201cPIK\u201d), or deferred, interest that accrues at 4% per annum.\nIn November 2016, $5,000,000 of principal and accrued interest obligations in connection with this loan was converted into our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. This had the effect of reducing principal by $4,935,834 and given interest rates we experienced during the year ended December 31, 2016, reduced annual interest expense by approximately $592,000 and annual cash interest payments by approximately $395,000.\nWe recorded interest expense of $4,497,945 and $4,360,042 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of those amounts, we paid to the lender $2,955,853 and $2,906,695 and, in accordance with the provisions of the loan agreement, added $1,499,315 and $1,453,347 to the principal amount of the loan during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u25cf\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations;\n\u25cf make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;\n\u25cf expose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate on our long-term debt is variable;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operations and other purposes;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt and greater financial resources.\nIn addition, our ability to meet minimum balance requirements, make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance, cash flows and capital resources, which in turn depend upon prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u25cf\neconomic and demand factors affecting our industry;\n\u25cf\npricing pressures;\n\u25cf\nincreased operating costs;\n\u25cf\ncompetitive conditions; and\n\u25cf\nother operating difficulties.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our minimum balance requirements or debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, the value realized on such assets or operations will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers. Accordingly, any such sale may not, among other things, be for a sufficient dollar amount. Our obligations pursuant to our long-term debt agreement are secured by a security interest in all of our assets, exclusive of capital stock of the Company, certain capital leases, certain contracts and certain assets secured by purchase money security interests. The foregoing encumbrances may limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations. We also may not be able to restructure our indebtedness on favorable economic terms, if at all.\nOur long-term debt agreement contains various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.\nOur long-term debt agreement contains, subject to certain carve-outs, various restrictive covenants that limit our management's discretion in operating our business. In particular, these instruments limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincur additional debt;\n\u25cf\ngrant liens on assets;\n\u25cf\nissue capital stock with certain features;\n\u25cf\nsell or acquire assets outside the ordinary course of business; and\n\u25cf\nmake fundamental business changes.\nAlthough we are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in the debt agreement, if we fail to comply with the restrictions in our long-term debt agreement, a default may allow the lender under the relevant instruments to accelerate the related debt and to exercise their remedies under these agreements, which will typically include the right to declare the principal amount of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other related amounts, immediately due and payable, to exercise any remedies the lender may have to foreclose on assets that are subject to liens securing that debt and to terminate any commitments they had made to supply further funds. The long-term debt agreement governing our indebtedness also contains various covenants that may limit our ability to pay dividends.\nRisks Relating to Our Organization\nOur certificate of incorporation allows for our board of directors to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Common Stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to such holders (i) the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, (ii) the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of Common Stock and (iii) the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our Common Stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our Common Stock or that is convertible into our Common Stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our Common Stock or result in dilution to our existing common stockholders.\nAny of the actions described in the preceding paragraph could significantly adversely affect the investment made by holders of our Common Stock. Holders of Common Stock could potentially not receive dividends that they might otherwise have received. In addition, holders of our Common Stock could receive less proceeds in connection with any future sale of the Company, whether in liquidation or on any other basis.\nWe are subject to extensive financial reporting and related requirements for which our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared.\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires us to conduct an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources. In order to maintain compliance with these requirements, we may need to (i) upgrade our systems, (ii) implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, (iii) implement an internal audit function, and (iv) hire additional accounting, internal audit and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective manner, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a negative impact on our ability to manage our business and on our stock price.\nWe may be at risk to accurately report financial results or detect fraud if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report that contains an assessment by management on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in their annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. We cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Also, future changes in our accounting, financial reporting, and regulatory environment may create new areas of risk exposure. Failure to modify our existing control environment accordingly may impair our controls over financial reporting and cause our investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting which may adversely affect our stock price.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur Common Stock is quoted on the OTCQB which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOur Common Stock is quoted on the OTCQB. The OTCQB is an automated quotation service operated by OTC Markets, LLC. The quotation of our shares on the OTCQB may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, in part because of the inability or unwillingness of certain investors to acquire shares of common stock not traded on a national securities exchange, and could depress the trading price of our common stock and have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur Common Stock is subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in our Common Stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our Common Stock.\nRule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our Common Stock and cause a decline in the market value of our Common Stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nOur Common Stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations which could adversely impact the value of our Common Stock.\nWhile there has been relatively active trading in our Common Stock over the past twelve months, there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our Common Stock will be maintained. Our Common Stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to periodically enter the market in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our Common Stock will be stable or appreciate over time.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on an investment in our Common Stock is expected to be limited to an increase in the value of the Common Stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our Common Stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition, and other business and economic factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our Common Stock may be considered less valuable because a return on a shareholder\u2019s investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nWe adopted a Rights Plan in 2010 which may discourage third parties from attempting to acquire control of our Company and have an adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock.\nIn November 2010, we adopted a rights plan (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) and declared a dividend distribution of twenty preferred share purchase rights for each outstanding share of Common Stock as of the record date on November 24, 2010. Each right, when exercisable, entitles the registered holder to purchase one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per shares of the Company at a purchase price of $18 per one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share of the Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments. The rights will generally separate from the Common Stock and become exercisable if any person or group acquires or announces a tender offer to acquire 15% or more of our outstanding Common Stock without the consent of our board of directors. Because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors, our Rights Plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us (or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock) without first negotiating with our board of directors. In addition, we are governed by provisions of Delaware law that may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us.\nThe provisions in our charter, bylaws, Rights Plan and under Delaware law related to the foregoing could discourage takeover attempts that our stockholders would otherwise favor, or otherwise reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for our Common Stock in the future.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, including upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144 or registration for resale, or issued upon the conversion of preferred stock, if any, or exercise of warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \"overhang\" and in anticipation of which the market price of our Common Stock could fall. As of December 31, 2016, we had 18,327,264 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2016, we had 180,000 shares underlying warrants that have been registered for resale pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 212437) and 7,500,000 shares of Common Stock underlying our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and 2,000,000 shares of common stock underlying our Series E Convertible Preferred Stock that have been registered for resale pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 214795). The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate more difficult.\nThe rights of our common stockholders are limited by and subordinate to the rights of the holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and Series E Convertible Preferred Stock; these rights may have a negative effect on the value of shares of our Common Stock.\nThe holders of our outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock have rights and preferences generally superior to those of our holders of Common Stock. The existence of these superior rights and preferences may have a negative effect on the value of shares of our Common Stock. These rights are more fully set forth in the certificates of designations governing these instruments, and include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe right to receive a liquidation preference, prior to any distribution of our assets to the holders of our Common Stock; and\n\u25cf the right to convert into shares of our Common Stock at the conversion price set forth in the certificates of designations governing the respective Preferred Stock, which may be adjusted.", "PERMNO": 92054, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "TWER"}
