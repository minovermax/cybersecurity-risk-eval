{"cik": "746515", "company": "EXPEDITORS INTERNATIONAL OF WASHINGTON INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nCOVID-19 significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and global trade and may continue to have a disruptive effect on our operations, and the operations of our service providers and our customers, which may further impact our business.\nCOVID-19 was declared as a global health emergency and later declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. As a result, throughout 2020 and 2021 and continuing into 2022, governments have implemented travel restrictions, mandated lockdowns and other precautionary measures that resulted in significant business and supply chain disruptions and has had direct impacts on international trade. This crisis has affected, and is expected to continue affecting, our business in many aspects. Governments have designated our operations as essential business and we activated our business continuity plan to be able to conduct operations. Our facilities and employees are operating under the constraints of special protective measures and many have been working remotely. As discussed in more detail under \u201cResults of Operations\u201d, there are significant constraints on current capacity for both air freight and ocean freight. This is due to a number of factors, including reduced flight schedules from pre-pandemic levels and new regulations, which limited available belly space for cargo, congestion at ports resulting from labor and equipment shortages and insufficient warehousing space at destinations. Air freighters and charters, container ships and gateway infrastructure are operating at near maximum capacity. While we believe these constraints are not long-term in nature, they impact our current ability to move increased air and ocean volumes in these capacity-constrained regions. These freight market conditions have created and continue to create pricing volatility that challenges Expeditors\u2019 ability to maintain historical unitary profitability. Many of our customers are experiencing disruptions in their revenues and cash flows and have incurred higher operating expenses as a result of supply chain cost increases and other inflationary pressures. This has caused some customers to renegotiate contractual terms, increasing our accounts receivable collection and extended liability risks. Such conditions could result in the loss of business and additional credit losses in the future if our customers\u2019 ability to pay deteriorates. Although we are monitoring the situation, we cannot predict for how long, or the ultimate extent to which the pandemic and related precautionary measures may disrupt our operations. Any significant disruption resulting from this on a large scale or over an extended period of time would negatively affect our business and our financial results. The COVID-19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below. Throughout 2021 and into 2022, transportation rates have risen to historically high levels. We believe that as Covid-19 disruptions recede, and passenger air travel rebounds, that port congestion will improve. This will result in additional transportation capacity becoming available. Rates will likely decline as this occurs. On a limited basis, we have entered in to fixed-rate buy agreements to secure space in the air and ocean markets. Future declines of sell rates will negatively affect our operating income and cash flows.\nWe rely on service providers, such as air, ocean and ground freight carriers, and if they become financially unstable or have reduced capacity to provide service because of COVID-19, it may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nAs a non-asset-based provider of global logistics services, Expeditors depends on a variety of carriers and other service providers, including air, ocean and ground freight carriers. The quality and profitability of our services depend upon effective selection and oversight of our service providers. During the pandemic, air carriers have been particularly affected having to cancel flights due to travel restrictions resulting in\n15.\ndramatic drops in revenues, historical losses, high leverage and liquidity challenges. Uncertainty over recovery of demand for passenger air travel, in particular business travel, to pre-pandemic levels means air carriers\u2019 operations and financial stability may be adversely affected long term. Prior to 2021, ocean carriers have incurred significant operating losses are still highly leveraged with debt. Additionally, several industry service providers, including ocean carriers, have consolidated, with the potential for more to occur in the future. COVID-19 places significant stress on our air, ocean and freight ground carriers, as well as other service providers, which may continue to result in reduced carrier capacity or availability, pricing volatility or more limited carrier transportation schedules and other services that we utilize, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nGlobal economic uncertainty impacted trade and could affect demand for our services or the financial stability of our service providers and customers.\nThe global economy entered a recession as a result of the pandemic, which initially affected trade and negatively affected demand for our services for a period of time, before rebounding in 2021. Future unfavorable economic conditions and high inflation could result in lower freight volumes and adversely affect Expeditors' revenues, operating results and cash flows. These conditions, should they occur for an extended period of time, could adversely affect our customers and service providers. Should our customers\u2019 ability to pay deteriorate, additional credit losses may be incurred.\nIndustry Risks\nAny reduction in international commerce or disruption in global trade may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nExpeditors primarily provides services to customers engaged in international commerce. Everything that affects international trade has the potential to expand or contract our primary market and adversely impact our operating results. For example, international trade is influenced by:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rates and currency control regulations;\n\u2022\ninterest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges and uncertainties in governmental policies and inter-governmental disputes, which could result in increased tariff rates, quota restrictions, trade barriers and other types of restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges in and application of international and domestic customs, trade and security regulations;\n\u2022\nwars, strikes, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, and other conflicts;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor and other costs, including the potential impacts of inflation;\n\u2022\nincreased global concerns regarding working conditions and environmental sustainability;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own;\n\u2022\nchanges in availability of credit; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleum-related products.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and failure to compete or respond to customer requirements could damage our business and results of operations.\nThe global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry, but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited. Nevertheless, many of these competitors have significantly more resources than Expeditors and are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities and are developing new technologies to gain competitive advantages. Depending on the location of the shipper and the importer, we must compete against niche players, larger entities including carriers, and emerging technology companies. The primary competitive factors are price and quality of service. Many larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers. Customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service and to secure favorable pricing and contractual terms such as longer payment terms, fixed-price arrangements, higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties. Increased competition and competitors' acceptance of expanded contractual terms coupled with customers\u2019 dissatisfaction with elevated rates, scarce capacity, and extended transit times could result in loss of business, reduced revenues, reduced margins, higher operating costs or loss of market share, any of which would damage our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOperational Risks\nWe are dependent on our personnel and any inability to hire, develop or retain our key employees may have a negative impact on our operations.\nIdentifying, recruiting, hiring, training, and retaining employees is essential to our ability to operate and deliver our services, ability to grow and ultimately our future profitability. The global pandemic has caused disruptions to our work environment by requiring the majority of employees to work remotely. As the pandemic restrictions ease, we are requiring employees to return to the office. As a result, for those individuals that prefer working remotely, we may experience a higher degree of turnover and lower employee satisfaction in the near future. Further, this could inhibit our ability to identify, recruit, and hire new employees. We cannot predict how this may affect employees\u2019 habits, preferences nor the\n16.\nimpact it may have on our Company\u2019s culture and our ability to continue to retain and attract talented employees who have become accustomed to a remote work environment. Additionally, we may incur higher compensation-related expense to recruit and retain employees.\nWe believe that our compensation programs are among the unique characteristics responsible for differentiating our performance from that of many of our competitors. Significant changes to compensation programs or significant declines in our operating income or operating losses could impact our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nEffective succession planning is an important element of our programs. Failure to ensure an effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business by hindering our ability to execute our business strategies and impacting our level of service. We must continue to develop and retain management personnel to address issues of succession planning.\nWe rely heavily upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies used in our core business and failure to properly manage such technologies could lead to disruptions in our operations or our ability to remain competitive.\nExpeditors relies heavily and must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing our core businesses. Future results depend on our success in developing competitive and reliable systems to address the needs of our customers and suppliers. Development and maintenance of these systems must be accomplished in a cost-effective manner and support the use of secure protocols, including integration and availability of third-party technology. We are continually enhancing our systems, including significant upgrades to core operating and accounting systems. These efforts are inherently complex and if not managed properly could lead to disruptions in our operations or our ability to remain competitive.\nAny significant disruptions to our network and systems continuity could have an adverse impact to our business and financial results.\nAs Expeditors, our customers and suppliers continue to increase reliance on systems, and as additional features are added, the risks also increase. Any significant disruptions to our global systems or the internet for any reason, which could include equipment or network failures; co-location facility failures; power outages; sabotage; employee error or other actions; cyber-attacks or other security breaches; reliance on third party technology; geo-political activity or natural disasters; all of which could have a material negative effect on our results. In February 2022, we were the subject of a targeted cyber-attack. Upon discovering the incident, we shut down most of our operating systems globally to manage the safety of our overall global systems environment. This shutdown and any such future events will result in loss of revenue; business disruptions (such as the inability to timely process shipments); and significant remediation costs. This cyber-attack could also result in increased vulnerability to attempts of fraud, legal claims and proceedings including potential breach of contract claims, reporting delays or errors; interference with regulatory reporting; an increase in costs to protect our systems and technology; or damage to our reputation.\nWe rely on service providers, including air, ocean, ground freight carriers and others, and if they have insufficient capacity available relative to market demand, or reduce our capacity allotments, it may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nAs a non-asset-based provider of global logistics services, Expeditors depends on a variety of carriers and other service providers, including air, ocean and ground freight carriers. Our ability to deliver our services depends on service providers\u2019 having sufficient capacity available to purchase. When market demand significantly exceeds available capacity in a given market, which has been increasingly the case for various services and markets since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, we may not always be able to find acceptable transportation or other service solutions to meet our customers\u2019 needs or the routing and delivery of freight may be subject to delays that are outside of our control. Quality customer service is a key element of the Company\u2019s success, and such challenges in meeting our customers\u2019 needs and requirements may result in loss of business and consequently negatively affect our operating results.\nFailure to grow and gain profitable market share could adversely impact our ability to remain competitive and could adversely impact our business.\nExpeditors has historically relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition. Future results will depend upon our ability to anticipate and adapt to constantly evolving supply chain requirements and innovations. To continue to grow organically, we must gain profitable market share in a highly competitive environment and successfully develop and market new service offerings. When investment opportunities arise, our success could be dependent on our ability to evaluate and integrate acquisitions.\nAny disruption of our business caused by a catastrophic event, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and impact our operating results.\nA disruption or failure of Expeditors' systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, strike, civil unrest, mass population dislocations, pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other mission-critical functions. Our corporate headquarters and certain other critical business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, which is near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results. See \u201cAny significant disruptions to our network and systems continuity could have an adverse impact to our business and financial results\u201d above.\n17.\nWe Face Risks Associated with the Handling of Customer Inventory\nUnder some of our agreements, we maintain the inventory of our customers. Our failure to properly handle and safeguard such inventory exposes us to unexpected claims and expenses as well as potential harm to our business and reputation.\nOur insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses and significant uninsured losses could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe carry insurance coverage for property damage and other insurable events resulting from certain events such as fire as well as other perils under extended coverage policies. Our insurance coverages contain policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar locations, business activities and markets. We believe we are adequately insured. Certain losses, however, including losses from floods, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots, cybersecurity events and pandemics, generally are not insured against or not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our facilities in the future, we could experience a significant loss of assets, including customer inventory, and future operations could be harmed resulting in a loss of revenues or higher claims and operating expenses.\nFurthermore, we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits then we could incur additional expenses or a loss of future revenues from a facility that is damaged. Any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business.\nDifficulty in forecasting timing or volumes of customer shipments or rate changes by carriers could adversely impact our margins and operating results.\nExpeditors is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting short-term customer requirements. However, long-term customer satisfaction depends upon our ability to meet these unpredictable short-term customer requirements. Personnel costs, our single largest expense, are always less flexible in the very near term as we must staff to meet uncertain demand. As a result, short-term operating results could be disproportionately affected.\nA significant portion of Expeditors' revenues is derived from customers in retail and technology industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just-in-time production schedules. Therefore, the timing of our revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of our control, such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods, changes in trade tariffs, product launches and/or manufacturing production delays. Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, we may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts or investors, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts or investors could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of our stock.\nVolatile market conditions can create situations where rate increases charged by carriers and other service providers are implemented with little or no advance notice. We often cannot pass these rate increases on to our customers in the same time frame, if at all. As a result, our yields and margins can be negatively impacted, as recently experienced.\nClimate change, including measures to address climate change, could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nThe long-term effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread. The impacts of climate change may include physical risks (such as rising sea levels, which could affect port operations or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions, which could disrupt our operations and damage cargo and our facilities), compliance costs and transition risks (such as increased regulation and taxation to support carbon emissions\u2019 reduction investments), shifts in customer demands (such as customers requiring more fuel efficient transportation modes or transparency to carbon emissions in their supply chains) and other adverse effects. Our non-asset-based model gives us a flexibility and an ability to change locations, modes, and carriers based on evolving operating conditions, however, such impacts may disrupt our operations by adversely affecting our ability to procure services that meet regulatory or customer requirements, depending on the availability of sufficient appropriate logistics solutions.\nIn addition, the increasing concern over climate change has resulted and may continue to result in more regulations relating to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions, restrictions on modes of transportation, alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives, such as the FuelEU Maritime initiative. If legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the United States or in any other jurisdictions in which we operate, that impose more stringent restrictions and requirements than our current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruptions in, or increases in the costs associated with delivering our services, which may negatively affect our operating our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n18.\nGovernment Regulation and Tax Risks\nWe are subject to a complex regulatory environment, and failure to comply with and adapt to these regulations could result in penalties or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nExpeditors is affected by ever increasing regulations from a number of sources in the United States and in foreign locations in which we operate. Many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation, including those related to handling dangerous and hazardous materials, trade compliance, data privacy, environmental, employment, compensation and competition, and may result in unforeseen costs.\nIn reaction to the continuing global terrorist threat, governments around the world are continuously enacting or updating security regulations. These regulations are multi-layered, increasingly technical in nature and characterized by a lack of harmonization of substantive requirements among various governmental authorities. Furthermore, the implementation of these regulations, including deadlines and substantive requirements, can be driven by regulatory urgencies rather than industry's realistic ability to comply.\nFailure to consistently and timely comply with these regulations, or the failure, breach or compromise of our policies and procedures or those of our service providers or agents, may result in increased operating costs, damage to our reputation, difficulty in attracting and retaining key personnel, restrictions on operations or fines and penalties.\nWe operate globally and any inability to safeguard our operations or comply with anti-corruption laws would adversely impact our reputation and business.\nThe majority of Expeditors' revenues and operating income comes from operations conducted outside the United States. To maintain a global service network, we may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations. Doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises.\nIn addition, we operate in parts of the world where common business practices could constitute violations of the anti-corruption laws, rules, regulations and decrees of the United States and of other countries in which we conduct business, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act; as well as trade and exchange control laws, or laws, regulations and Executive Orders imposing embargoes and sanctions; and anti-boycott laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, regulations and decrees is dependent on our employees, service providers, agents, third party brokers and customers, whose individual actions could violate these laws, rules, regulations and decrees. Failure to comply could result in substantial penalties and additional expenses, damage to our reputation and restrictions on our ability to conduct business.\nWe are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions, and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse determinations in tax audits could negatively impact our financial results.\nExpeditors is subject to income and non-income taxation in the United States (Federal, state and local) as well as many foreign jurisdictions including the People\u2019s Republic of China, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, India, Mexico, Canada, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In many of these jurisdictions, the tax laws are very complex and are open to different interpretations and application. Tax authorities frequently implement new taxes and change their tax rates and rules, including interpretations of those rules. The timing of the resolution of income and non-income tax examinations can be highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts recorded.\nIt is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will undergo further audits and examinations by various tax authorities and possibly may reach resolution related to income tax examinations covering one or more jurisdictions and years. In recent years, the United States and other foreign governments have made significant changes to tax laws, and more changes are anticipated in future periods. Often, those changes are subject to the issuance of new regulations and interpretations, which adds complexity and uncertainty in calculating tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, including transfer pricing inquiries. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits, including any potential penalties and interest, could be materially different from our tax provisions and accruals and negatively impact our financial results.\nCurrent economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or statutory tax rates, competing tax regimes, variability in the mix of pretax earnings we generate in the U.S, as compared to other countries, or new taxes in the United States or foreign jurisdictions could result in additional tax liabilities, or increased volatility in our effective tax rate and total tax expense.\n19.\nGeneral Risks\nInvestigations and litigation could require management time and or incur substantial legal costs or fines, penalties or damages, any of which could adversely impact on our financial results.\nAs a multinational corporation, Expeditors is subject to formal or informal investigations from governmental authorities or others in the countries in which we do business. In addition, we may become subject to civil litigation with our customers, service providers and other parties with whom we do business. These investigations and litigation may require significant management time and could cause us to incur substantial additional legal and related costs, which may include fines, penalties or damages that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results.", "PERMNO": 87717, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "EXPD"}
