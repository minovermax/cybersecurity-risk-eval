{"cik": "1282631", "company": "NETLIST INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and the other information in this report. Each of these risk factors, either alone or together, could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, ability to access capital resources and future growth prospects, as well as the value of an investment in our securities. As a result, you could lose some or all of any investment you have made or may make in our securities. In\nassessing these risks, you should also review the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, and the other filings we make with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial position.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have historically incurred losses and may continue to incur losses.\nSince the inception of our business in 2000, we have only experienced one fiscal year (2006) with profitable results. In order to regain profitability, or to achieve and sustain positive cash flows from operations, we must reduce operating expenses and/or increase our revenues and gross margins. Although we have in the past engaged in a series of cost reduction actions, such expense reductions alone may not make us profitable or allow us to sustain profitability if it is achieved, and eliminating or reducing strategic initiatives could limit our opportunities and prospects. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend on increased revenue growth from, among other things, increased demand for our memory subsystems and other product offerings and our ability to monetize our intellectual property. We may not be successful in any of these pursuits, and we may never achieve profitability or sustain profitability if achieved.\nOur results of operations fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict.\nOur operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past, and we expect they will continue to fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include, among others, the amount and timing of sales of products, the prices we charge for products, changes in product mix, customer mix or other similar factors, the rate and timing of our billing and collections cycles and the timing and amount of our commitments and other payments, as well as the other risk factors described in this report. In addition, our results may be impacted by events that do not recur regularly, in the same amounts or at all in other periods, including events that may result in our incurrence of cash or non-cash charges or gains in certain periods.\nThese fluctuations in our operating results may render period-to-period comparisons less meaningful, and investors should not rely on the results of any one period as an indicator of future performance. Moreover, these fluctuations in our operating results could cause our performance in any particular period to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or any guidance we have provided to the public, which could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may not have sufficient working capital to fund our planned operations, and, as a result, we may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.\nTo support our activities in the near term, we expect to rely on cash provided by our operations and proceeds from recent issuances of debt and equity securities, such as our issuance of convertible debt to an affiliate of Samsung Venture Investment Co. (\u201cSVIC\u201d) in November 2015 in connection with the JDLA; our September 2016 and August 2017 public offerings of common stock; our ongoing \u201cat-the-market\u201d common stock offering program established in November 2017; our funding arrangement with TR Global Funding V, LLC, an affiliate of TRGP Capital Management, LLC (\u201cTRGP\u201d), for costs associated with certain of our legal proceedings; and borrowing availability under our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d). Taking into account our planned activities and sources of capital, we believe we have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our estimates of our operating revenues and expenses and working capital requirements could be incorrect, and we may use our cash resources faster than we anticipate. Further, some or all of our ongoing or planned investments may not be successful and could further deplete our capital without immediate, or any, cash returns.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:\n\u00b7\nthe acceptance of, and demand for, our products and the component products we resell to customers;\n\u00b7\nour success, and that of our strategic partners, in developing and selling products derived from our technology;\n\u00b7\nthe extent and timing of any investments in developing, marketing and launching new or enhanced products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of developing, improving and maintaining our internal design, testing and manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nour results of operations, including our levels of net product revenues and any other revenues we may receive, including non-recurring engineering (\u201cNRE\u201d), license, royalty or other fees;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of vendor payments and the collection of receivables, among other factors affecting our working capital;\n\u00b7\nour receipt of cash proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options or warrants to acquire our common stock;\n\u00b7\nthe nature and timing of acquisitions or other strategic transactions or relationships in which we engage, if any; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with the continued operation, and any future growth, of our business.\nUntil we can generate sufficient revenues to finance our cash requirements from our operations, which we may never do, we may need to increase our liquidity and capital resources by one or more measures, which may include, among others, reducing operating expenses, restructuring our balance sheet by negotiating with creditors and vendors, entering into strategic partnerships or alliances, raising additional financing through the issuance of debt, equity or convertible securities or pursuing alternative sources of capital, such as through asset or technology sales or licenses or other alternative financing arrangements. Further, even if our near-term liquidity expectations prove correct, we may still seek to raise capital through one or more of these financing alternatives. However, we may not be able to obtain capital when needed or desired, on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nInadequate working capital would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations and could cause us to fail to execute our business plan, fail to take advantage of future opportunities or fail to respond to competitive pressures or customer requirements. A lack of sufficient funding may also require us to significantly modify our business model and/or reduce or cease our operations, which could include implementing cost-cutting measures or delaying, scaling back or eliminating some or all of our ongoing and planned investments in corporate infrastructure, research and development projects, business development initiatives and sales and marketing activities, among other activities. Modification of our business model and operations could result in an impairment of assets, the effects of which cannot be determined. Furthermore, if we continue to issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are superior to those of our existing stockholders. Additionally, if we are not able to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the challenges and risks of equity financings may significantly increase, including potentially increasing the dilution of any such financing or decreasing our ability to effect such a financing at all. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization or have other material consequences. If we pursue asset or technology sales or licenses or other alternative financing arrangements to obtain additional capital, our operational capacity may be limited and any revenue\nstreams or business plans that are dependent on the sold or licensed assets may be reduced or eliminated. Moreover, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing any future capital-raising transactions, including investment banking, legal and accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other similar costs, which would reduce the benefit of the capital received from the transaction.\nWe may be unsuccessful in monetizing our intellectual property portfolio.\nWe dedicate substantial resources to developing technology innovations we believe are essential to our business. We intend to pursue monetization avenues for our intellectual property portfolio, potentially including licensing, royalty or other revenue-producing arrangements. However, we have not generated any such revenue stream from our intellectual property to date, and we may never be successful in achieving this objective.\nAlthough we may pursue agreements with third parties to commercially license certain of our products or technologies, we may never successfully enter into any such agreement. Further, the terms of any such agreements we may reach with third-party licensees are uncertain and may not provide sufficient royalty or other licensing revenues to us to justify our costs of developing and maintaining the licensed intellectual property or may otherwise include terms that are not favorable to us. Additionally, the pursuit of licensing arrangements would require by its nature that we relinquish certain of our rights to our technologies and intellectual property that we license to third parties, which could limit our ability to base our own products on such technologies or could reduce the economic value we receive from such technologies and intellectual property. Additionally, the establishment of arrangements to monetize our intellectual property may be more difficult or costly than expected, may require additional personnel and investments and may be a significant distraction for management.\nOur ability to establish licensing, royalty or similar revenues, and maintain or increase any such revenues we are able to establish, depends on a variety of factors, including, among others, the novelty, utility, performance, quality, breadth, depth and overall perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio, all as compared to that of our competitors, as well as our sales and marketing capabilities. Even if we are able to secure these revenues, they may be negatively affected by factors that are entirely or partially outside our control, including reductions in our customers\u2019 sales prices, sales volumes and the general state of their business, as well as the terms of the license arrangements.\nIf we are not successful in monetizing our intellectual property portfolio, we may never recoup our investments of time, capital and other resources in the development, maintenance, defense and enforcement of this portfolio, which could materially harm our financial condition and prospects.\nWe have incurred a material amount of indebtedness to fund our operations, the terms of which have required us to pledge substantially all of our assets as security. Our level of indebtedness and the terms of such indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.\nWe have incurred debt under our convertible note issued to SVIC, our credit facility with SVB, and our new funding arrangement with TRGP. In connection with these debt and other arrangements, we have granted security interests to SVIC, SVB and TRGP in our various assets, such that all of our tangible and intangible assets, including our complete patent portfolio, are subject to one or more outstanding liens held by one or more of these parties.\nThe SVIC and SVB debt instruments and the TRGP investment agreement contain customary representations, warranties and indemnification provisions, as well as affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u00b7\nincur liens;\n\u00b7\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate or merge;\n\u00b7\nsell or exclusively license assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nalter our business;\n\u00b7\nchange any provision of our organizational documents;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\nmake certain decisions regarding certain of our outstanding legal proceedings without consulting with or obtaining consent from certain of these parties; and\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make distributions.\nThe SVIC and SVB debt instruments and the TRGP investment agreement also include events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, any breach by us of representations, warranties or covenants, certain bankruptcy events and certain material adverse changes. If an event of default were to occur under any of these instruments or agreements and we were unable to obtain a waiver for the default, the counterparties could, among other remedies, accelerate our obligations under the debt instrument or other agreement and exercise their rights to foreclose on their security interests, which would cause substantial harm to our business and prospects.\nAdditionally, incurrence and maintenance of this or other debt could have material adverse consequences on our business and financial condition, such as:\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations and other capital resources to debt service, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other cash requirements;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes and opportunities in our business and industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to incur additional debt when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe are and expect to continue to be involved in legal proceedings at the ITC to try to stop allegedly infringing SK hynix RDIMM and LRDIMM products from entering the United States, as well as legal proceedings in U.S. and international courts to seek damages for the alleged patent infringement. Our involvement in these proceedings, as well as steps we have taken to implement certain of our strategies in connection with these proceedings, subject us to a number of risks.\nWe have taken action to protect and defend our innovations by filing legal proceedings for patent infringement against SK hynix and two of its subsidiaries in the ITC, U.S. district court and the courts of Germany and the PRC. In our two separate ITC actions, we have requested exclusion orders that direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to stop allegedly infringing SK hynix RDIMM and LRDIMM products from entering the United States. In our U.S. district court and international court proceedings, we are primarily seeking damages.\nOur first ITC action was resolved in January 2018 with a final determination of no infringement of the patents asserted in this action. Although our second ITC action, which relates to different patents, and our U.S. and international\ncourt proceedings remain ongoing, the loss of the first ITC action could negatively impact our prospects for positive results in these other proceedings. Further, although standard procedures at the ITC afford us the opportunity to appeal the ITC\u2019s final determination and we are currently considering our options regarding any such appeal, any decision to pursue such an appeal would require significant resources, including capital expenditures and management attention. Moreover, if we do not appeal the final determination or if we appeal and lose, then we will have invested significant time and funds in this ITC action that will not be recovered with any cash returns.\nOur remaining proceedings against SK hynix, as with any intellectual property litigation, are expensive and time-consuming, regardless of the merits of the claims, and could divert management\u2019s attention from our other activities. Even if we are successful at the ITC, we would then need to enforce the order, which could also be expensive, time-consuming and a diversion to management. In addition, lawsuits in the ITC and in courts are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved and various other factors, and we may not be successful in any of our actions. For example, our second ITC action currently faces a ruling by the ITC on a motion for summary determination that SK hynix has filed, which, if granted, would end this action in its entirety in SK hynix\u2019s favor. Moreover, if we are countersued by SK hynix and lose the suit, we could be required to pay substantial damages or lose some of our intellectual property protections. Furthermore, we may not be able to reach a settlement with SK hynix to license our patent portfolio, and even if we are able to reach a settlement, the terms of the arrangement may not be as favorable as we anticipated. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs, decrease the perceived value of our intellectual property and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have taken steps intended to solidify our position and strategy in connection with our proceedings against SK hynix. In May 2017, we established a funding arrangement with TRGP, which generally provides that TRGP will directly fund the costs incurred by us or on our behalf in connection with certain of our SK hynix proceedings (including our first ITC action and our U.S. district court proceedings, but excluding our second ITC action and our proceedings in international courts), and in exchange for such funding, we have agreed to pay to TRGP the amount of its funding plus an escalating premium if and when we recover any proceeds from the funded proceedings, and we have granted to TRGP a first-priority lien on the claims underlying the funded proceedings and any proceeds received from the funded proceedings and a second-priority lien on our patents that are the subject of the funded proceedings. We established this funding arrangement in order to provide us with increased security that we will be able to vigorously pursue our claims against SK hynix through their final resolution, but the arrangement also involves certain risks, including, among others, our obligation to use a portion of any proceeds we may receive from these proceedings to repay the funded amounts at a premium, which premium would increase the longer the proceedings remain unresolved, and our obligation to consult with or obtain consent from TRGP in connection with certain decisions or other matters relating to the SK hynix proceedings. Further, our arrangement with TRGP only covers fees incurred in connection with certain of our outstanding proceedings against SK hynix, and we are responsible for funding costs related to our other outstanding proceedings and any future actions we may file. As a result, our ability to fund all of our proceedings against SK hynix may be limited to our own cash resources, in which case we may be forced to severely limit our pursuit of these claims and/or our other operations.\nIn addition, in April 2017, we adopted a rights agreement to implement a standard \u201cpoison pill.\u201d In general terms, for so long as the rights issued under the rights agreement are outstanding, the rights agreement prevents any person or group from acquiring a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock or attempting a hostile takeover of our Company by significantly diluting the ownership percentage of such person or group. As a result, the rights agreement has a significant anti-takeover effect. Our board of directors approved the rights agreement as part of our strategy in connection with our proceedings against SK hynix, with the intent of disconnecting our market capitalization from the damages calculations and any settlement negotiations that may develop in connection with these proceedings. However, the rights agreement may not have the intended, or any, impact on these proceedings or any related settlement negotiations, but would have the anti-takeover effect of any standard \u201cpoison pill\u201d and thus would involve the risks associated with these anti-takeover effects, which are described elsewhere in these risk factors.\nWe are and expect to continue to be involved in other legal and administrative proceedings to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights and to defend against claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nAs is common in the semiconductor industry, we have experienced substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We are currently involved in litigation and proceedings at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) and Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d) based on alleged third-party infringement of our patents, and lawsuits claiming we are infringing others\u2019 intellectual property rights also have been and may in the future be brought against us.\nOur business strategy includes litigating claims against others, such as our competitors, customers and former employees, to enforce our intellectual property, contractual and commercial rights, including, in particular, our patent portfolio and our trade secrets, as well as to challenge the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This or other similar proceedings could also subject us to counterclaims or countersuits against us, or the parties we sue could seek to invalidate our patents or other intellectual property rights through reexamination or similar processes at the USPTO or similar bodies. Further, any legal disputes with customers could cause them to cease buying or using our products or the component products we resell or delay their purchase of these products and could substantially damage our relationship with them.\nMoreover, our ability to continue to pursue this strategy depends on our ability to obtain and protect patents, which is governed by an uncertain process. In addition to the patent issuance process established by law and the procedures of the USPTO, we must also comply with administrative procedures of the JEDEC to protect our intellectual property within its industry standard-setting process. These procedures evolve over time, are subject to variability in their application and may be inconsistent with each other. Any failure to comply with the USPTO\u2019s or JEDEC\u2019s administrative procedures could jeopardize our ability to claim that our patents have been infringed.\nMaking use of new technologies and entering new markets increases the likelihood that others might allege that our products or the component products we resell infringe their intellectual property rights. The likelihood of this type of lawsuit may also be increased due to the limited pool of experienced technical personnel that we can draw on to meet our hiring needs. As a result, a number of our existing employees have worked for our existing or potential competitors at some point during their careers, and we anticipate a number of our future employees will have similar work histories. Moreover, lawsuits of this type may be brought, even if there is no merit to the claim, as a strategy to prevent us from hiring qualified candidates, drain our financial resources and divert management\u2019s attention away from our business.\nLitigation is inherently uncertain. An adverse outcome in existing or any future litigation could force us to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nrelinquish patents or other protections of our technologies if they are invalidated, which would enable our competitors and others to freely use this technology;\n\u00b7\ncompete with products that rely on technologies and other intellectual property rights that we believe we have the right to protect from third-party use;\n\u00b7\naccept terms of an arrangement to license our technologies to a third party that are not as favorable as we might expect;\n\u00b7\nreceive little or no returns for our time and capital investments in the litigation;\n\u00b7\ncease manufacturing and/or selling products or using certain processes that are claimed to be infringing a third party\u2019s intellectual property;\n\u00b7\npay damages (which in some instances may be three times actual damages), including royalties on past or future sales, if we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nseek a license from a third -party intellectual property owner to use its technology in our products or the component products we resell, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or\n\u00b7\nredesign any products that are claimed to be infringing a third party\u2019s intellectual property, which may not be possible to do in a timely manner, without incurring significant costs or at all.\nMoreover, any litigation, regardless of its outcome, involves a significant dedication of resources, including time and capital, and diverts management\u2019s attention from our other activities. As a result, any current or future infringement claims or patent challenges by or against third parties, whether or not eventually decided in our favor or settled, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the outcome of pending or future litigation and related patent reviews and reexaminations, as well as any delay in their resolution, could affect our ability to continue to sell our products, protect against competition in the current and expected markets for our products or license or otherwise monetize our intellectual property rights in the future.\nThe vast majority of our revenues in recent periods have been generated from resales of component products, including primarily products sourced from Samsung, and any decline in these product resales could significantly harm our performance.\nThe vast majority of our revenues in recent periods have been generated from resales of component products, including NAND flash and DRAM products. We resell these component products to end-customers that are not reached in the distribution models of the component manufacturers, including storage customers, appliance customers, system builders and cloud and datacenter customers.\nThese component product resales are subject to a number of risks. For example, demand for these products could decline at any time for a number of reasons, including, among others, changing customer requirements or preferences, product obsolescence, introduction of more advanced or otherwise superior competing products by our competitors, the ability of our customers to obtain these products or substitute products from alternate sources (including from the manufacturer directly), customers reducing their need for these products generally, or the other risk factors described in this report. We have no long-term agreements or other commitments with respect to sales of these or any of the other products we sell. As a result, any decrease in demand for these products from us would reduce our sale levels and could materially adversely impact our revenues.\nIn addition, we have historically obtained the majority of the component products we resell from Samsung. We may experience supply shortages from Samsung at any time and for a variety of reasons, including, among others, spikes in customer demand that cannot be satisfied, any problems that arise with Samsung\u2019s manufacturing operations or facilities that cause disruptions or delays, or any failure to comply with the terms of the JDLA regarding the supply of these products. If we choose, or if we are forced, to seek to supply the component products we resell from other suppliers, we may not be able to identify other suppliers that are available and able to produce the particular components with the specific product specifications and in the quantities our customers require, or we may not be able to make arrangements with any other suppliers in a timely manner to avoid delays in satisfying customer orders. Further, even if we are able to make arrangements with other suppliers for sufficient component products to replace any undersupply from Samsung, we may not be able to make these arrangements on financial and other terms comparable to those we have negotiated with Samsung under the JDLA. As a result, any inability to obtain sufficient component products from Samsung could increase our cost of sales for component product resales if we are forced to pay higher prices to obtain the products from other suppliers. Moreover, all of our supply arrangements for these component products, including the terms of the JDLA and any arrangements we may establish with other suppliers, are subject to the other supply and manufacturing risks discussed elsewhere in these risk factors.\nIncreased reliance on product resales also has a substantial impact on our results of operations. Because the cost of the component products we purchase for resale is added to our cost of sales for these products, our gross margin on resales of component products is significantly lower than our gross margin on sales of our own memory subsystem products. As a result, increased resales of component products as a percentage of our total product revenues have a significant negative impact on our gross margin and gross profit. This gross margin and gross profit differential between\nmemory product sales and component product resales would be amplified if our costs to purchase component products were to increase.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of these risks could cause our performance to materially suffer.\nOur performance has historically been substantially dependent on sales of NVvault, and we may never be able to replace the revenues lost from the rapid decline in NVvault sales in recent periods.\nWe have historically been substantially dependent on sales of our NVvault NVDIMM. However, we have experienced a sharp decline in demand for and sales of NVvault in recent periods. This rapid decline has been due in large part to the loss of our former most significant NVvault customer, Dell, beginning in 2012. We have recognized no NVvault sales to Dell in the past several years, and we expect no future demand from Dell for these products.\nAlthough we continue to pursue qualifications of NVvault with OEMs and potential new customer applications, we have had limited success with these efforts to date and may not be successful in the future. In addition, although we have introduced NVvault product extensions and other next-generation products, including most recently our HybriDIMM memory subsystem, the rate and degree of customer adoption of these products has been slower and smaller than expected, and these trends could continue or these products may never gain significant customer or market acceptance. We believe our future operating results will depend on our ability to grow demand for and sales of our memory subsystem products, by securing new NVvault customers or successfully commercializing NVvault product extensions and other next-generation products. However, we may not be successful in these pursuits. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, we may never be able to secure revenues and gross profits at levels sufficient to replace lost NVvault sales and our results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our focus on developing our HybriDIMM and NVvault products for our target customer markets.\nWe have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of our high-performance modular memory subsystems to OEMs in the server, high-performance computing and communications markets. Although we expect these memory subsystems to continue to account for a portion of our revenues, we have experienced declines in sales of these products in recent periods, and these declines could continue or intensify in the future. We believe market acceptance of these products or derivative products that incorporate our core memory subsystem technology is critical to our success, and any continued decline in sales of these products could have a material adverse impact on our performance and long-term prospects.\nWe have invested significant research and development time and capital in the design of ASIC and hybrid devices, including our NVvault family of products and most recently our next-generation HybriDIMM memory subsystem. These products are subject to significant risks, including:\n\u00b7\nwe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for the DRAM ICs, NAND flash and ASIC devices that are essential to the functionality of these products, and in the past we have experienced supply chain disruptions and shortages of DRAM and NAND flash required to create these products as a result of issues that are specific to our suppliers or the industry as a whole;\n\u00b7\nHybriDIMM and some of our other next-generation products may require additional time including the services and attention of key employees who have competing demands on their available time and may require capital investment to bring the products to market;\n\u00b7\nour development and commercialization strategies for these products;\n\u00b7\nwe are required to demonstrate the quality and reliability of our products to and qualify them with our customers before purchases are made, which requires investments of time and resources in significant and unpredictable amounts prior to the receipt of any revenues from these customers; and\n\u00b7\nour NVvault products or other new products, such as HybriDIMM, may contain currently undiscovered flaws, the correction of which could result in increased costs and time to market.\nThese and other risks associated with our memory subsystem products could impair our ability to obtain customer or market acceptance of these products or obtain such acceptance in a timely manner, which would reduce our achievable revenues from these products and limit our ability to recoup our investments in developing these technologies.\nAdditionally, if the demand for servers deteriorates, if the demand for our products to be incorporated in servers continues to decline, or if demand for our products deteriorates because customers in our other target markets change their requirements or preferences or otherwise reduce their need for these types of products generally, our operating results would be adversely affected, and we would be forced to diversify our product portfolio and our target customer markets in order to try to replace revenues lost from the further decreases in product sales. We may not be able to achieve this diversification, and any inability to do so may adversely affect our business, operating performance and prospects.\nSales to a small number of varying customers have historically represented a significant portion of our net product revenues, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any one of these customers could materially harm our business.\nOur target markets are characterized by a limited number of large companies, and consolidation in one or more of these markets may further increase this concentration. As a result, sales to small numbers of customers have historically represented a substantial portion of our net product revenues, and we expect this concentration to continue. Additionally, the composition of major customers and their respective contributions to our net product revenues have fluctuated and will likely continue to fluctuate from period to period as our existing and prospective customers progress through the life cycle of the products they produce and sell and experience resulting fluctuations in their product demand. We believe our performance depends in significant part on our ability to establish and maintain relationships with and effect substantial sales to our large customers.\nWe do not have long-term agreements with any of our customers and, as result, any or all of them could decide at any time to decrease, delay or discontinue their purchase of our products or the component products we resell. In addition, the prices customers pay for products are subject to fluctuations, and large or key customers may exert pressure on us to make concessions in the prices at which we sell products to them. Further, we may not be able to sell some of our products developed for one customer to a different customer because our products are often customized to address specific customer requirements, and even if we are able to sell these products to another customer, our margin on these products may be reduced. Additionally, although customers are generally allowed only limited rights of return after purchasing our products or the component products we resell, we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns from certain large or key customers even if we are not contractually obligated to accept them in order to maintain good relations with these customers. Any returns beyond our expectations could negatively impact our operating results. Moreover, because a few customers often account for a substantial portion of our net product revenues, the failure of any one of these customers to pay on a timely basis would negatively impact our cash flows. As a result, our net product revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our customers, particularly our large or key customers, a decrease in product sales to any of our customers, including as a result of normal fluctuations in demand or other factors, reductions in the prices at which we sell products to any of our customers, including as a result of price concessions or general declines in average sale prices, or difficulties collecting payments from any of our customers.\nOur ability to maintain or increase our product sales to our key customers depends on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include our customers\u2019 continued sales of servers and other computing systems that incorporate our memory subsystems, our customers\u2019 continued incorporation of our products or the component products we resell into their systems, and our customers\u2019 sales activity and business results. Because of these\nand other factors, sales to these customers may not continue and the amount of such sales may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period.\nWe are subject to risks of disruption in the supply of component products.\nOur ability to fulfill customer orders for or produce qualification samples of our memory subsystem products, as well as orders for the component products we resell, is dependent on a sufficient supply of FPGAs, ASICs, DRAM ICs and NAND flash, which are essential components of our memory subsystems. We have no long-term supply contracts for any of these component products. Further, there are a relatively small number of suppliers of these components, and we typically purchase from only a subset of these suppliers. As a result, our inventory purchases have historically been concentrated in a small number of suppliers, including an affiliate of Samsung, from which we obtained a large portion of our component products purchased for resale and our total inventory purchases in 2016 and 2017. We also use consumables and other components, including PCBs, to manufacture our memory subsystems, which we sometimes procure from single or limited sources to take advantage of volume pricing discounts.\nFrom time to time, shortages in DRAM ICs and NAND flash have required some suppliers to limit the supply of these components. In the past, we have experienced supply chain disruptions and shortages of DRAM and NAND flash required to create certain of our memory subsystem products, and we have been forced to procure the component products we resell from other suppliers to the extent sufficient product is not available from Samsung to meet customer demand or in the event of other Samsung supply issues. We are continually working to secure adequate supplies of the components necessary to fill customers\u2019 orders in a timely manner. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of DRAM ICs, NAND flash or other essential components to avoid interruptions or failures in the delivery of our products as required by our customers or the delivery of these components to customers to whom we resell them directly, these customers may reduce future orders for these products or not purchase these products from us at all, which could cause our net product revenues to decline and harm our operating results. In addition, our reputation could be harmed due to failures to meet our customers\u2019 demands and, even assuming we are successful in resolving supply chain disruptions, we may not be able to replace any lost business and we may lose market share to our competitors. Further, if our suppliers are unable to produce qualification samples of our products on a timely basis or at all, we could experience delays in the qualification process with existing or prospective customers, which could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products. Moreover, if we are not able to obtain these components in the amounts needed on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we may not be able to develop or introduce new products, we may experience significant increases in our cost of sales if we are forced to procure components from alternative suppliers and are not able to negotiate favorable terms with these suppliers, or we may be forced to cease our sales of products dependent on the components or resales of the components we sell to customers directly.\nOur dependence on a small number of suppliers and the lack of any guaranteed sources for the essential components of our products and the components we resell expose us to several risks, including the inability to obtain an adequate supply of these components, increases in their costs, delivery delays and poor quality. Additionally, our customers qualify certain of the components provided by our suppliers for use in their systems. If one of our suppliers experiences quality control or other problems, it may be disqualified by one or more of our customers. This would disrupt our supplies of these components, and would also reduce the number of suppliers available to us and may require that we qualify a new supplier, which we may not be able to do.\nDeclines in customer demand for our products in recent periods have caused us to reduce our purchases of DRAM ICs and NAND flash for use as components in our products. Such declines or other fluctuations could continue in the future. If we fail to maintain sufficient purchase levels with some suppliers, our ability to obtain supplies of these raw materials may be impaired due to the practice of some suppliers of allocating their products to customers with the highest regular demand.\nFrequent technology changes and the introduction of next-generation versions of component products may also result in the obsolescence of our inventory on-hand, which could involve significant time and costs to replace, reduce our net product revenues and gross margin and adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition.\nOur customers require that our products undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process without any assurance of sales.\nOur prospective customers generally test and evaluate our memory subsystems before purchasing our products and integrating them into their systems. This extensive qualification process involves rigorous reliability testing and evaluation of our products, which may continue for nine months or longer and is often subject to delays. In addition to qualification of specific products, some of our customers may also require us to undergo a technology qualification if our product designs incorporate innovative technologies that the customer has not previously encountered. Such technology qualifications often take substantially longer than product qualifications and can take over a year to complete. Even after our products are qualified with existing or new customers, the customer may take several months to begin purchasing the product or may decide not to purchase the product at all, as qualification does not ensure product sales. As a result, we could receive no or limited revenues from a customer even after our investment of time and resources in the qualification process with this customer, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nEven after successful qualification and sales of our products to a customer, because the qualification process is both product-specific and platform-specific, our existing customers sometimes require us to re-qualify our products or to qualify our new products for use in new platforms or applications. For example, as our OEM customers transition from prior generation architectures to current generation architectures, we must design and qualify new products for use by these customers. Our net product revenues to these customers can decline significantly during this re-qualification process.\nLikewise, changes in our products, our manufacturing facilities, our production processes or our component suppliers may require a new qualification process. For example, if our memory, NAND flash and DRAM component suppliers discontinue production of these components, it may be necessary for us to design and qualify new products for our customers. As a result, some customers may require us, or we may decide, to purchase an estimated quantity of discontinued memory components necessary to ensure a steady supply of existing products until products with new components can be qualified. Purchases of this nature may affect our liquidity. Additionally, our forecasts of quantities required during the transition may be incorrect, which could adversely impact our results of operations through lost revenue opportunities or charges related to excess and obsolete inventory.\nWe must devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualify our products with prospective customers in anticipation of sales. Significant delays or other difficulties in the qualification process could result in an inability to keep pace with rapid technology change or new competitive products. If we experience delays or do not succeed in qualifying a product with an existing or prospective customer, we would not be able to sell that product to that customer, which may result in excess and obsolete inventory that we may not be able to sell to another customer and could reduce our net product revenues and customer base, any of which could materially harm our operating results and business.\nIf we are unable to timely and cost-effectively develop new or enhanced products that achieve customer and market acceptance or technologies we can monetize, our revenues and prospects could be materially harmed.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and rapid product obsolescence. As a result, continuous development of new technology, processes and product innovations is necessary in order to be successful. We believe the continued and timely development of new products and technologies and improvement of existing products and technologies are critical to our business and prospects for growth.\nIn order to develop and introduce new or enhanced products and technologies, we need to:\n\u00b7\nretain and continue to attract new engineers with expertise in memory subsystems and our key technology competencies;\n\u00b7\nidentify and adjust to the changing requirements and preferences of our existing and potential future customers and markets;\n\u00b7\nidentify and adapt to emerging technological trends and evolving industry standards in our markets;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to develop and enhance our design tools, manufacturing processes and other technologies on which we rely to produce new products or product enhancements;\n\u00b7\ndesign and introduce cost-effective, innovative and performance-enhancing features that differentiate our products and technologies from those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nsecure licenses to enable us to use any technologies, processes or other rights essential to the manufacture or use of any new products or product enhancements we may develop, which licenses may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u00b7\nmaintain or develop new relationships with suppliers of components required for any new or enhanced products and technologies;\n\u00b7\nqualify any new or enhanced products for use in our customers\u2019 products; and\n\u00b7\ndevelop and maintain effective commercialization and marketing strategies.\nWe may not be successful at any of these activities. As a result, we may not be able to successfully develop new or enhanced products or technologies or we may experience delays in this process. Failures or delays in product development and introduction could result in the loss of, or delays in generating, net products sales or other revenues and the loss of key customer relationships. Even if we develop new or enhanced products or technologies, they may not meet our customers\u2019 requirements, gain market acceptance or attract monetization opportunities, as our product and technology development efforts are inherently risky due to the challenges of foreseeing changes or developments in technology, predicting changes in customer requirements or preferences or anticipating the adoption of new industry standards. Moreover, we have invested significant resources in our product and technology development efforts, which would be lost if we fail to generate revenues from these efforts. If any if these risks occur, our revenues, prospects and reputation could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition in our industry, and we may not be able to compete successfully in our target markets.\nOur products are primarily targeted to OEMs in the server, high-performance computing and communications markets. In addition, we resell certain component products to storage customers, appliance customers, system builders and cloud and datacenter customers. These markets are intensely competitive, as numerous companies vie for business opportunities at a limited number of large OEMs and other customers. We face competition from DRAM suppliers, memory module providers and logic suppliers for many of our products, including EXPRESSvault, NVvault and HybriDIMM. We also face competition from the manufacturers and distributors of the component products we resell to customers, as these manufacturers and distributors could decide at any time to sell these component products to these customers directly. Additionally, if and to the extent we enter new markets or pursue licensing arrangements to monetize our technologies and intellectual property portfolio, we may face competition from a large number of competitors that produce solutions utilizing similar or competing technologies.\nSome of our customers and suppliers may have proprietary products or technologies that are competitive with our products or the components we resell to them, or could develop internal solutions or enter into strategic relationships with, or acquire, other high-density memory module or component providers. Any of these actions could reduce our customers\u2019 demand for our products or the component products we resell. Additionally, some of our significant suppliers could choose to sell component products to customers directly, which would adversely affect our ability to resell these products, or may be choose to manufacture competitive memory subsystem products themselves or reduce our supply of\nessential components of our products, which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our memory subsystems.\nWe believe our ability to compete in our current target markets and potential future markets will depend in part on our ability to successfully and timely develop, introduce and sell at attractive prices new and enhanced products or technologies and otherwise respond to changing market requirements, which we may not be able to do faster and better than our competitors. Moreover, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, broader product lines, lower cost structures, greater brand recognition, more influence on industry standards, more extensive or established patent portfolios and longer standing relationships with customers and suppliers. We may not be able to compete effectively against any of these organizations. If we are unable to compete effectively, then our market position and prospects could deteriorate and our revenues could decline.\nIf our proprietary rights are not protected, our customers or our competitors might gain access to our proprietary designs, processes and technologies, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe rely on a combination of patent protection, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We have submitted a number of patent applications regarding our proprietary processes and technology, many of which have resulted in issued patents. For our pending patent applications, it is uncertain when or if any of the claims in these applications will be allowed or result in issued patents, in which case the technologies or processes sought to be patented would remain unprotected from use by third parties. In addition, although we intend to continue filing patent applications with respect to new processes and technologies we develop, patent protection may not be available for some of these processes or technologies. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining patent protection, these protections could be limited in scope by the USPTO, a court or applicable foreign authorities or challenged by third parties by way of review or reexamination proceedings and subsequently invalidated, which would reduce the protections these patents are able to provide. Moreover, patent protection is limited as to duration and all of our issued patents will eventually expire, at which time the previously protected technologies would become widely available for use by third parties, including our competitors.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, these efforts may not:\n\u00b7\nprevent challenges to or the invalidation or circumvention of our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nkeep our competitors or other third parties from independently developing similar products or technologies, duplicating, reverse engineering or otherwise using our products or technologies without our authorization or designing around any patents that may be issued to us;\n\u00b7\nprevent disputes with third parties regarding ownership of our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nprevent disclosure of our trade secrets and know-how to third parties or into the public domain;\n\u00b7\nresult in valid patents, including international patents, from any of our pending or future applications; or\n\u00b7\notherwise adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nMoreover, monitoring for any unauthorized use of our technologies is costly, time-consuming and difficult. This is particularly true in foreign countries, such as the PRC, where we have established a manufacturing facility and where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as applicable U.S. laws.\nIf some or all of the claims in our patent applications are not allowed, if any of our issued patents or other intellectual property protections are limited, invalidated or circumvented by third parties, or if we are not able to obtain extensions of existing patents upon their expiration or issuance of new patents to maintain protections provided by expiring patents, we could face increased competition for our products and technologies and be unable to execute on our\nstrategy of monetizing our intellectual property. Any of these outcomes could significantly harm our business, operating results and prospects.\nOur operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic and political uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address and in which we or our strategic partners or competitors do business, including the cyclical nature of and volatility in the memory market and semiconductor industry.\nChanges in domestic and global economic and political conditions make it difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and these conditions have caused and could continue to cause U.S. and foreign businesses to slow or decrease spending on our products and the products we resell. For instance, the current political instability in Korea could impact our operations and financial condition as a result of our relationships with Samsung, a South Korea-based company, as a key supplier, as well as our ongoing legal proceedings against SK hynix.\nIn addition, sales of our products and the products we resell are dependent on demand by customers in our target markets. These markets are characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand and have been cyclical in the past, which may result in substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results. In addition, these markets have in the past experienced significant downturns, often connected with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles, reductions in technology spending and declines in general economic conditions. During these downturns, product demand diminishes, production capacity exceeds demand, inventory levels increase and average sale prices decline, all of which would materially adversely impact our business and operating results. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, if we are unable to control our expenses adequately in response to reduced product demand and sales, our gross margins and cash flows would be negatively impacted. Further, such a downturn could decrease the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio and reduce our ability to pursue our intellectual property monetization objectives.\nDuring challenging economic times, our customers may face challenges gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us. This may negatively affect our liquidity and cash flows and require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. Furthermore, our vendors may face similar issues gaining access to credit, which may limit their ability to supply components or provide trade credit to us.\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, either generally or in our customer markets. If the economy or markets in which we operate experience such a slowdown, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The combination of our lengthy sales cycle coupled with any challenging macroeconomic conditions could compound the negative impact of any such downturn on the results of our operations.\nOur lack of a significant backlog of unfilled orders and the difficulty inherent in estimating customer demand makes it difficult to forecast our short-term requirements, and any failure to optimally calibrate our production capacity and inventory levels to meet customer demand could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and earnings.\nWe make significant decisions regarding the levels of business we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement, personnel needs and other resource requirements based on our estimates of customer demand. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our customers. Instead, our product sales are made primarily pursuant to stand-alone purchase orders that we often receive no more than two weeks in advance of the desired delivery date and that may be rescheduled or cancelled on relatively short notice. The short-term nature of the commitments by many of our customers and our customers\u2019 ability to cancel or defer purchase orders for any reason reduces our backlog of firm orders and our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements for our products or the component products we resell. These facts, combined with the short turnaround times that apply to most orders, makes it difficult to predict our production and inventory needs and allocate production capacity and capital for inventory purchases effectively. As a result, we attempt to forecast the demand for the components needed to manufacture our products and to resell to customers directly, but any such forecasts could turn out to be wrong. Further, lead times for components vary\nsignificantly and depend on various factors, such as the specific supplier and the demand and supply for a component at any given time.\nOur production expense and component purchase levels are to a large extent fixed in the short term. As a result, we may be unable to adjust spending on a timely basis to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in customer orders. If we overestimate customer demand, we may have excess component or finished goods inventory, which may not be able to be used in other products or resold and may become obsolete before any such use or resale. If there is a subsequent decline in the prices of components, the value of our inventory would fall and we may be required to write-down the value of our component inventory, which may result in a significant increase in our cost of sales and decrease in our gross margin. In the past, we have had to write-down inventory due to obsolescence, excess quantities and declines in market value below our costs. As a result, any significant shortfall of customer orders in relation to our expectations could hurt our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nConversely, any rapid increases in demand by our customers could strain our resources. If we underestimate customer demand, we may not have sufficient inventory of necessary components on hand to meet that demand and we may need to try to procure additional quantities, which may not be available or may only be available at high prices or on otherwise unfavorable terms. We also may not have sufficient manufacturing capacity at any given time to meet any demands for rapid increases in production of our memory subsystem products. Any shortages of inventory or manufacturing capacity could lead to delays in the delivery of products, which may force us to forego sales opportunities, reduce our net product revenues and damage our customer relationships.\nIn addition, if our product demand forecasts are wrong, we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. If our inventories are determined to be overvalued, we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of sales at the time of the determination. Conversely, if our inventories are determined to be undervalued, we may have over-reported our costs of sales in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross profit at the time the inventories are sold.\nDeclines in our average sale prices, driven by volatile prices for components and other factors, may result in declines in our revenues and gross profit.\nOur industry has historically been characterized by declines in average sale prices. If sale price declines are not offset by corresponding decreases in costs or increases in sales volume or sales of products with higher margins, these sale price declines could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe prices customers pay for the products we sell can fluctuate due to many factors, including, among others, competitive conditions in our key customer markets, changes in customer requirements or preferences, volatility in the market prices for DRAM ICs, NAND flash and other component products, and changes in manufacturing efficiencies or capacities. Market prices for component products have historically constituted a substantial portion of the total cost of our memory subsystems and in recent periods have constituted the vast majority of the cost of resales of these products to customers directly. As a result, fluctuations in the prices for these component products, due to overcapacity in worldwide supply or increased manufacturing efficiencies, implementation of new manufacturing processes or expansion of manufacturing capacity by component suppliers, among other factors, significantly impact our costs to sell our products or component products.\nOnce our prices with a customer are negotiated, we are generally unable to revise pricing with that customer until our next regularly scheduled price adjustment. As a result, if market prices for essential components increase, we generally cannot pass the price increases through to our customers for products purchased under an existing purchase order. Consequently, we are exposed to the risks associated with the volatility of prices for these components and our cost of sales could increase and our gross margins could decrease in the event of sudden price increases. Alternatively, if there are declines in the prices of these components, we may be required to reduce our selling prices for subsequent purchase orders, which may result in a decline in our net product revenues.\nOur manufacturing operations involve significant risks.\nWe maintain a manufacturing facility in the PRC at which we produce most of our products. These manufacturing activities require significant resources to maintain. For instance, we must continuously review and improve our manufacturing processes in order to maintain satisfactory manufacturing yields and product performance, try to lower our costs and otherwise remain competitive. As we manufacture new and more complex products, the risk of encountering delays, difficulties or higher costs increases. In addition, the start-up costs associated with implementing new manufacturing technologies, methods and processes, including the purchase of new equipment and any resulting manufacturing delays and inefficiencies, could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we could experience a prolonged disruption, material malfunction, interruption or other loss of operations at our manufacturing facility, or we may need to add manufacturing capacity to satisfy any increased demand for our products. Under these circumstances, we may be forced to rely on third parties for our manufacturing needs, which could increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our gross margin, decrease our control over manufacturing processes, limit our ability to satisfy customer requirements and demand and delay new product development until we could secure a relationship with a third-party manufacturer, which we may not be able to do in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. If any of these risks occur, our operations, performance and customer relationships could be severely harmed.\nWe also may need to expand our existing manufacturing facility or establish a new facility in the future. Any need to expand or replace our manufacturing facility would be expensive and time-consuming and could also subject us to factory audits by our customers that could themselves result in delays, unexpected costs or customer losses if we cannot meet the standards of any such audits. Further, we may not be able to replace or increase our manufacturing capacity at all. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties to design and manufacture components for our products and the component products we resell, which exposes us to risks.\nComponents that are used in our products, as well as all of the component products we resell, are designed and manufactured by third parties. In addition, some of our memory subsystem products rely on significantly customized components. The ability and willingness of third parties to enter into these engagements with us and perform in accordance with these engagements is largely outside our control. If one or more of our design or manufacturing partners experiences a manufacturing disruption, fails to dedicate adequate resources to the production of the components we use in our products or the components we resell, experiences financial instability or otherwise fails to perform its obligations to us in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market or deliver products to our customers, as well as our reputation, could suffer and our business and prospects could be materially harmed. In the event of any failure by our component manufacturers, we may have no readily available alternative source of supply for these components, since, in our experience, the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new design or manufacturing partner is substantial, and the time for our OEM customers to re-qualify our products with components from a new vendor is also significant. Additionally, even if an alternative manufacturer is available, we may not be able to engage the manufacturer on acceptable terms, which could result in increased costs, timing requirements or other adverse changes. Further, we may not be able to redesign the customized components used in our products to be manufactured by a new manufacturer, in which case we could infringe on the intellectual property of our current design or manufacturing partner when we manufacture the products with a new design or manufacturing partner. Such an occurrence could force us to stop selling certain of our products or could expose us to lawsuits, license payments or other liabilities.\nOur dependence on third-party manufacturers exposes us to many other risks, including, among others: reduced control over delivery schedules, quality, manufacturing yields and costs; the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand; limited warranties on products supplied to us; and potential infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others. We are dependent on our manufacturing partners to manufacture components with acceptable quality and manufacturing yields, to deliver these components to us on a\ntimely basis and at an acceptable cost and to allocate a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs. However, these component manufacturers may not be able to achieve these tasks. Additionally, our manufacturing partners may not continue to devote adequate resources to produce our products or the component products we resell, or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the customer qualifications of our products are based. Any of these risks could limit our ability to meet customer demand and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf our products or the component products we resell do not meet quality standards or are defective or used in defective systems, we may be subject to quality holds, warranty claims, recalls or liability claims.\nOur customers require our products and the component products we resell to meet strict quality standards. If the products fail to meet these standards, our customers may discontinue purchases from us until we are able to resolve the quality issues that are causing these failures, which we may not be able to do. These \u201cquality holds\u201d can be costly and time-consuming to resolve. In addition, if the products we sell are defectively manufactured, contain defective components or are used in defective or malfunctioning systems, we could be subject to warranty and product liability claims, product recalls, safety alerts or advisory notices.\nAlthough we generally attempt to contractually limit our exposure to incidental and consequential damages, if these contract provisions are not enforced or if liabilities arise that are not effectively limited, we could incur substantial costs in defending or settling product liability claims. While we currently have product liability insurance, it may not provide coverage under certain circumstances and it may not be adequate to satisfy claims made against us. We also may be unable to maintain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts.\nWarranty and product liability claims, product \u201cquality holds,\u201d product recalls, safety alerts or advisory notices, regardless of their coverage by insurance or their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, performance and financial condition, as well as our ability to attract and retain customers.\nIf a standardized memory solution that addresses the demands of our customers is developed, our net product revenues and market share may decline.\nMany of our memory subsystems are specifically designed for our OEM customers\u2019 high-performance systems. In a drive to reduce costs and assure supply of their memory module demand, our OEM customers may endeavor to design JEDEC standard DRAM modules into their new products. Although we also manufacture JEDEC modules, this trend could reduce the demand for our higher-priced customized memory solutions, which would have a negative impact on our operating results. In addition, the adoption of a JEDEC standard module instead of a previously custom module might allow new competitors to participate in a share of our customers\u2019 memory module business that previously belonged to us.\nIf our OEM customers were to adopt JEDEC standard modules, our future business may be limited to identifying the next generation of high-performance memory demands of OEM customers and developing solutions that address these demands. Until fully implemented, any next generation of products may constitute a significantly smaller market, which could reduce our revenues and harm our competitive position.\nWe may become involved in non-patent related litigation and administrative proceedings that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of these actions could subject us to monetary damages or other liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur indemnification obligations for the infringement by our products of the rights of others could require us to pay substantial damages.\nAs is common in our industry, we have a number of agreements in which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers and suppliers from damages and costs that may arise from the infringement by our products of third-party patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights. The scope of these indemnities varies, the duration of these indemnities is generally perpetual after execution of an agreement, and the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnities is often unlimited. Any indemnification claims by customers could require us to incur significant legal fees and could potentially result in our payment of substantial damages, and our insurance generally would not cover these fees or damages. As a result, the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on certain key employees, and our business could be harmed if we lose the services of any of these employees or are unable to attract and retain other qualified personnel.\nTo date, we have been highly dependent on the experience, relationships and technical knowledge of certain key employees. We believe our future success will be dependent on our ability to retain the services of these key employees, develop their successors and properly manage the transition of their roles should departures occur. The loss of these key employees or their inability to continue to provide their services could delay the development and introduction of new or enhanced products or technologies, negatively impact our ability to sell our existing products, limit our ability to pursue our other business goals and strategies and otherwise harm our business. We do not have employment agreements with any of our employees other than Chun K. Hong, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, and as a result most of our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time. We maintain \u201cKey Man\u201d life insurance on Mr. Hong, but we do not carry \u201cKey Man\u201d life insurance on any of our other employees.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled engineering, manufacturing and other technical and sales personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense. We may not be successful in attracting new engineers or other technical personnel or in retaining or motivating our existing personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain personnel with the skills necessary to keep pace with the evolving technologies in our markets, our ability to continue to provide our existing products and to develop new or enhanced products and technologies would be negatively impacted, which could harm our business. In addition, a general shortage of experienced engineers or other technical personnel could lead to increased recruiting, relocation and compensation costs to attract new recruits, which may increase our operating expenses or make these hires more difficult or impossible if increased recruiting costs exceed our resources.\nA significant portion of our workforce consists of contract personnel. We invest considerable time and expense to train these contract personnel; however, they typically may terminate their relationships with us at any time. As a result, we may experience high turnover rates in this contract personnel workforce, which may require us to expend additional resources to attract, train and retain replacements. Additionally, if we convert any of these contract personnel to permanent employees, we may have to pay finder\u2019s fees to the contract agency. These risks associated with our contract personnel workforce may involve increased costs or delays or failures in meeting customer requirements or developing new or enhanced products or technologies, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating performance.\nWe rely on our internal and third-party sales representatives to market and sell our products and the component products we resell, and any failure by these representatives to perform as expected could reduce our sales.\nWe primarily market and sell our products and the component products we resell through a direct sales force and a network of independent sales representatives. We have expended significant resources to build our internal sales and marketing function, but compared to many of our competitors, we have relatively little experience creating a sales and marketing platform and developing a team to implement it. We may be unsuccessful in these efforts.\nOur sales representatives generally may terminate their relationships with us at any time. As a result, our performance depends in part on our ability to retain existing and attract additional sales representatives that will be able to effectively market and support our products or the component products we resell, especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed these products. Our efforts to attract, train and retain these sales representatives to be knowledgeable about our industry, products and technologies are costly and time-consuming. If these efforts fail, our investments in these sales representatives may not produce the expected or any benefits and our ability to market and sell our products or the component products we resell may be limited, which could materially harm our financial condition and operating results. Further, our reliance on independent sales representatives subjects us to risks, as we have very little control over their activities and they are generally free to market and sell other, potentially competing, products. As a result, these independent sales representatives could devote insufficient time or resources to marketing our products or the component products we resell, could market them in an ineffective manner or could otherwise be unsuccessful in selling adequate quantities of these products.\nWe are exposed to additional business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks related to our international sales and operations.\nWe sell products to foreign corporations and deliver products to facilities located in foreign countries. To facilitate this process and to meet the long-term projected demand for our products, we have established a manufacturing facility in the PRC that performs most of the manufacturing activities for our memory subsystem products.\nSelling and manufacturing in foreign countries subjects us to additional risks not present with our domestic operations, as we are operating in business and regulatory environments in which we have limited experience and that may impose materially different requirements. Further, the geographic distance from our headquarters in Irvine, California, compounds the difficulties of maintaining a manufacturing operation in the PRC. For instance, we may not be able to maintain the desired amount of control over production capacity and timing, inventory levels, product quality, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields or costs. Moreover, we will need to continue to overcome language and cultural barriers to effectively conduct these international operations. Failures in any of these areas could result in legal consequences or production delays and increased turnaround times, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, changes to the labor or other laws of the PRC or the economic and political conditions in the PRC, including increased industrialization in recent years, could increase the costs of employing a local workforce or conducting our manufacturing operations in the PRC. Any of these factors could negatively impact any cost savings we experience from locating our manufacturing facility in the PRC. Additionally, our management has limited experience creating or overseeing foreign operations generally, and the ongoing administration and operation of our PRC facility may require substantial amounts of time and attention by our management team, particularly if we encounter operational, legal or cultural difficulties or disruptions at our PRC facility.\nTo date, all of our net product revenues have been denominated in U.S. dollars. In the future, however, some of our net product revenues may be denominated in Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d). The Chinese government controls the procedures by which RMB is converted into other currencies, which generally requires government consent. As a result, RMB may not be freely convertible into other currencies at all times. If the Chinese government institutes changes in currency conversion procedures or imposes additional restrictions on currency conversion, our operations and our operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, Chinese law imposes restrictions on the movement of funds outside of the PRC. If we need or decide to repatriate funds from our Chinese operations, we would be required to comply with the procedures and regulations of applicable Chinese law, and any failure to so comply could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. Further, if we are able to repatriate funds from our Chinese operations, these funds would be subject to U.S. taxes. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rate between RMB and U.S. dollars may adversely affect our expenses, the value of our assets and liabilities and the comparability of our period-to-period results.\nOur international operations and sales are subject to a number of additional risks, including, among others, timing and availability of export licenses; difficulties in accounts receivable collections; difficulties managing distributors; lack of a significant local sales presence in a number of markets; difficulties obtaining government approvals; compliance with anti-bribery, data protection and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as\na wide variety of other complex foreign laws, regulations and treaties; and potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, the United States or foreign countries may implement quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions on the importation or exportation of our products or the component products we resell, which could lead to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country. This risk of increased trade barriers or charges has become more pronounced following the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as the trade policies of the current U.S. presidential administration, including withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and proposed revision to the North American Free Trade Agreement, could threaten or otherwise have a significant negative effect on our ability to continue to conduct our international operations in the same manner and at the same costs as we have in the past.\nIn addition, international turmoil and the threat of future terrorist attacks have contributed to an uncertain political and economic climate, both in the United States and globally, and have negatively impacted the worldwide economy. The economies of the PRC and other countries in which we make sales have been volatile in recent years, resulting in significant fluctuations in local currencies and other instabilities. These conditions could continue or worsen, which could adversely affect our foreign operations and our performance.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks related to our international operations, including our manufacturing facility in the PRC and our international sales, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects for growth.\nOur operations could be disrupted by power outages, natural disasters or other factors.\nDue to the geographic concentration of our manufacturing operations in our PRC facility and our small number of component suppliers, including Samsung for many of the component products we resell, a disruption resulting from equipment or power failures, quality control issues, human errors, government intervention or natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods, could require significant costs to repair and could interrupt or interfere with product manufacture and sale and cause significant delays in product shipments, which could harm our customer relationships, financial condition and results of operations. In the past, our PRC facility has suffered water damage as a result of heavy rains and floods, which forced us to temporarily halt manufacturing at the facility while necessary repairs or equipment replacements were made. This incident caused us to incur additional expenses because we were forced to shift our manufacturing activities to a third-party facility in the PRC to mitigate the disruption in product shipments to our customers. If manufacturing at the PRC facility is disrupted for similar or other reasons in the future, we may again be subject to increased expenses in order to engage a third-party manufacturer, or, if we are not able to secure alternative manufacturing capabilities, our ability to sell products and our relationships with our customers could be materially harmed. Additionally, we may be forced to bear significant costs in order to repair any damage to our manufacturing equipment and facility. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDifficulties with our global information technology systems, including any unauthorized access, could harm our business.\nWe store key data about our business, including certain customer data, information about our and our customer\u2019s intellectual property and other proprietary information, on our global information technology systems. Any failure or malfunctioning of our global information technology systems, errors or misuse by system users, difficulties migrating stand-alone systems to our centralized systems or inadequacy of the systems in addressing the needs of our operations could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products, divert management\u2019s and key employees\u2019 attention from other business matters and involve significant costs and other resources to repair or otherwise resolve, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such event could also disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process, report and evaluate key operating metrics and key components of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and could adversely affect our ability to complete other important business processes, such as maintenance of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nWhile our information technology systems include security measures designed to prevent unauthorized access, employee error, employee malfeasance or other causes, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, could circumvent these measures and result in unauthorized access to these systems. Because the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems evolve frequently and often are not recognized until successful, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures in a timely manner. Any security breach could require significant resources to correct, if correction is possible, and could result in disruption to our business, misappropriation or loss of data, loss of confidence in us by our customers, damage to our reputation and legal liability. Further, any failure to implement appropriate security measures to protect our information or any breach or other failure of our systems that results in unauthorized access, manipulation, disclosure or loss of this information could result in our violation of any U.S. or foreign data protection laws that are applicable to us. These laws and their interpretation and application are constantly evolving, and they could be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our current practices or they could become more stringent over time. Efforts to comply with applicable data protection laws or any new interpretations of their application could involve significant time and substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures, and any failures to so comply could subject us to substantial civil or criminal fines or sanctions. Any of these outcomes could have a material negative impact on our business, performance and prospects.\nOur failure to comply with environmental and other applicable laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liabilities or cause us to incur significant costs.\nWe are subject to various and frequently changing U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. In particular, some of our manufacturing processes may require us to handle and dispose of hazardous materials from time to time. For example, in the past our manufacturing operations have used lead-based solder in the assembly of our products. Today, we use lead-free soldering technologies in our manufacturing processes, as this is required for products entering the European Union. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, civil or criminal fines or sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or noncompliance with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Although we have not incurred significant costs to date to comply with these laws and regulations, new laws or changes to current laws and regulations to make them more stringent could require us to incur significant costs to remain in compliance.\nWe also may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to other matters, including workplace health and safety, labor and employment, foreign business practices (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and applicable foreign anti-bribery laws), data protection, public reporting and taxation, among others. It is difficult and costly to manage the requirements of every authority having jurisdiction over our various activities and to comply with their varying standards. Additionally, any changes to existing regulations or adoption of new regulations may result in significant additional expense to us or our customers. Further, our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including monetary penalties or imposition of sanctions or other corrective requirements, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation and our business.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nThe U.S. Congress has enacted laws, and the SEC has adopted rules, requiring disclosure of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. These laws and rules require companies to verify and disclose whether or not such minerals, as used in a company\u2019s products or their manufacture, originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Because our products contain certain conflict minerals and we or our manufacturers use these conflict minerals in the manufacture of our products, we are required to comply with these laws and disclosure rules. To comply, we are required to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry each year and, depending on the results of that inquiry, we may be required to exercise due diligence on the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals contained\nin or used to manufacture our products. Such due diligence must conform to a nationally or internationally recognized due diligence framework. We are also required to file a disclosure report with the SEC each year relating to our conflict mineral use.\nThe due diligence activities required to determine the source and chain of custody of minerals contained in our products or used in their manufacture are time-consuming and may result in significant costs. Due to the size and complexity of our supply chain, we face significant challenges verifying the origins of the minerals used in our products or their manufacture. Further, these rules could affect the availability in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices of certain minerals used in our products and their manufacture, which could result in increased material and component costs and additional costs associated with potential changes to our products, processes or sources of supply. Additionally, if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the minerals used in our products through the due diligence measures we implement, we may not be able to satisfy customer preferences or requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals in the products they purchase, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not be effective, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, which we collectively refer to as Section 404, require us to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting and require management to report on the effectiveness of this internal control as of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, if and when we are no longer a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable SEC rules, Section 404 will require us to obtain an attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm as to our internal control over financial reporting.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to produce accurate and reliable financial reports and is important in our efforts to prevent financial fraud. In the course of our Section 404 evaluations, we or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discover significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, we may be unable to produce accurate and reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could result in a loss of customer or investor confidence in us or our public disclosures and negatively impact our stock price. Any of these outcomes could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, our Section 404 evaluations may lead us to conclude that enhancements, modifications or changes to our internal control over financial reporting are necessary or desirable. Implementing any such changes would divert the attention of management, involve significant time and costs and negatively impact our financial reporting functions during the transition, any of which could have a material negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not effectively manage any future growth we may experience, our resources, systems and controls may be strained and our results of operations may suffer.\nAny future growth we may experience could strain our resources, management, information and telecommunication systems and operating and financial controls. To manage future growth effectively, including any expansion of volume in our manufacturing facility in the PRC, we must be able to improve and expand our systems and controls, which we may not be able to do in a timely or cost-effective manner. In addition, our management team has relatively limited experience managing a rapidly growing business. As a result, they may not be able to manage any future growth we may experience. A failure to manage any growth we may experience or improve or expand our existing systems and controls, or unexpected difficulties in doing so, could harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we acquire businesses or technologies or pursue other strategic transactions or relationships in the future, these transactions could disrupt our business and harm our operating results and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or technologies or pursue other strategic transactions or relationships, including collaboration or joint development arrangements, that might complement our current product offerings or enhance our intellectual property portfolio or technical capabilities. We have no experience acquiring other businesses or technologies.\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions or relationships entail a number of risks that could adversely affect our business and operating results, including, among others:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties integrating the operations, technologies or products of acquired companies or working with third parties with which we may partner on joint development or collaboration relationships;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from the daily operations of our business;\n\u00b7\ninsufficient increases in revenues to offset increased expenses associated with an acquisition or strategic transaction or relationship;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties retaining business relationships with our existing suppliers and customers or the suppliers and customers of an acquired company;\n\u00b7\noverestimation of potential synergies or other benefits, or a delay in realizing these synergies or other benefits;\n\u00b7\nentering markets in which we have no or limited experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u00b7\nthe potential loss of key employees of our Company or an acquired company;\n\u00b7\nexposure to contingent liabilities of an acquired company;\n\u00b7\ndepletion of cash resources to fund an acquisition or other strategic transaction or establish a strategic relationship, or dilution of existing stockholders or increased leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization if we issue debt or equity securities for these purposes;\n\u00b7\nadverse tax consequences; and\n\u00b7\nincurrence of material charges, such as depreciation, deferred compensation charges, in-process research and development charges, the amortization of amounts related to deferred stock-based compensation expense and identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill.\nIf any of these risks occur, we may not be able to realize the intended benefits of an acquisition or strategic transaction or relationship, and our operating results, financial condition and business prospects could be materially negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price and trading volume of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock has been publicly traded since November 2006. The price and trading volume of our common stock are volatile and have in the past fluctuated significantly. This volatility could continue, in which case an active trading market in our common stock may not be sustained and stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at a desired time or a desired price.\nThe market price at which our common stock trades may be influenced by many factors, including, among others, the following:\n\u00b7\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perceptions of us and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nour ability to meet investor and analyst expectations for our operating results;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and level of research coverage of and market-making in our common stock;\n\u00b7\nchanges in buy/sell recommendations by analysts;\n\u00b7\nany financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes to these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u00b7\nour announcement of significant strategic transactions or relationships or the initiation of legal proceedings, including patent infringement actions;\n\u00b7\nthe results of legal proceedings in which we are involved;\n\u00b7\ngeneral political, economic and market conditions, including volatility or uncertainty in these conditions; and\n\u00b7\nthe other risk factors described in this report.\nIn addition, shares of our common stock and the public stock markets in general have experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme price and trading volume volatility, at times irrespective of the state of the business of any particular company. These fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities litigation can sometimes be instituted against the company. Securities litigation, like other types of litigation, is expensive and time-consuming, and if such litigation is instituted against us in the future, we may incur substantial costs, management\u2019s attention and resources may be diverted, and we could be subject to damages in the event of unfavorable results.\nWe are not in compliance with certain Nasdaq listing requirements, and we may not be able to maintain our Nasdaq listing.\nOn September 26, 2017, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notifying us that, because the bid price of our common stock closed below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, we are no longer in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price rule, which is a requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We have also experienced several other periods of noncompliance with this rule in recent years,\nincluding during 2015 and into early 2016 and during April and May of 2017. On January 3, 2018, we received another letter from Nasdaq notifying us that, because the market value of our common stock fell below a minimum of $35.0 million for a period of 30 consecutive business days, we are no longer in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s market value of listed securities rule, which is also a requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Because of our failure to comply with the market value of listed securities rule and certain other Nasdaq continued listing standards, we were not automatically eligible for a 180-day extension of the deadline to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule, which was passed on March 26, 2018. As a result, our common stock became subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market on that date, and we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying us of such delisting determination on March 29, 2018. We have elected to appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel, in which we are requesting additional time to regain compliance with these Nasdaq rules, and our common stock will remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market pending the outcome of the appeal. However, the likelihood of success on the appeal is unpredictable and it could be denied, in which case our common stock would be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market shortly after the appeal decision is made. Moreover, even if the appeal is successful, we would still be required to regain compliance with these Nasdaq rules and all other continued listing requirements by a new future deadline, which we may not be able to do.\nIf our appeal of the delisting determination is not successful, or if our appeal is successful but we fail to regain compliance with all applicable Nasdaq rules and requirements by the new deadline, then our common stock would be delisted from trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Further, even if we are able to regain compliance by any new deadline but then again fail to comply with these or any other Nasdaq requirements in the future, then we would receive additional deficiency letters from Nasdaq and our common stock could be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market at a later date. Any such delisting would cause our common stock to be classified as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d among other potentially detrimental consequences, and could severely limit the liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect the price of our common stock. Any of these outcomes could significantly impact our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock or to sell these shares at a price that a stockholder may deem acceptable.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution to the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have historically funded our operations in large part with proceeds from equity and convertible debt financings, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. In addition to capital-raising purposes, we may also issue securities from time to time at prices and on other terms as we determine for acquiring other businesses or assets in exchange for shares of our common stock or other securities, issuing securities to collaborators in connection with strategic partnerships, attracting and retaining employees with equity compensation, or other purposes. If we sell common stock or other equity or convertible debt securities in the future, our then-existing stockholders could be materially diluted by such issuances and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, regardless of the state of our business.\nAs of December 30, 2017, there were 79,313,868 shares of our common stock outstanding, 8,745,170 shares of our common stock subject to outstanding stock options, 4,924,124 of our common stock subject to outstanding warrants, and 12,507,615 shares of our common stock subject to outstanding convertible notes. All outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market under applicable federal securities laws, subject in certain cases to the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and shares issued upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding stock options, warrants or convertible notes may also be eligible for sale in the public market, to the extent permitted by Rule 144 or other applicable securities laws and the provisions of the applicable stock option, warrant and convertible note agreements. If these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they may be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could fall.\nOur principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders.\nAs of March 26, 2018, 5.9% of our outstanding common stock was held by our directors and officers, including 5.7% held by Chun K. Hong, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors. As a result, Mr. Hong has the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of control could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with interests different from those of Mr. Hong.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law, as well as our rights agreement, could delay or prevent a change of control and could also limit the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable, including:\n\u00b7\nour board of directors is authorized, without prior stockholder approval, to designate and issue preferred stock, commonly referred to as \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which may have rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nstockholder action by written consent is prohibited;\n\u00b7\nnominations for election to our board of directors and the submission of matters to be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting are subject to advance notice requirements; and\n\u00b7\nour board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Further, in April 2017, we adopted a rights agreement that would, under certain specified circumstances and for so long as the rights issued under the rights agreement are outstanding, give the holders of our common stock the right to acquire additional shares of our capital stock, which would make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock or attempt a hostile takeover of our Company.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law, as well as the existence of our rights agreement, could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our board of directors, including a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other change of control transaction involving our Company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could prevent the consummation of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then-current market price for our common stock. In addition, these anti-takeover provisions could reduce the price that investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and any return to investors is expected to result, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.\nWe intend to use all available funds to finance our operations. Accordingly, while all decisions about dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors, we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock in the past, and we have no intention of declaring or paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, any return to investors is expected to result, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91616, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "NLST"}
