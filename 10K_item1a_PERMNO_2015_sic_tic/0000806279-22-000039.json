Unless the context otherwise requires, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cCodorus Valley Bancorp, Inc.,\u201d \u201cCodorus Valley\u201d or the \u201cCorporation\u201d refer to Codorus Valley Bancorp, Inc. and its direct or indirect owned subsidiaries, and references to the \u201cBank\u201d refer to PeoplesBank, a Codorus Valley Company, the wholly-owned banking subsidiary of the Corporation.\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Corporation. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or focused on, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impact our\nbusiness and results of operations. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWeakness in the economy may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally, which continue to be uncertain and include uneven economic growth, accompanied by low interest rates. Dramatic declines in the housing market following the 2008 financial crisis, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. While conditions have improved, a return to a recessionary or excessive inflationary economy could result in financial stress on our borrowers that would adversely affect consumer confidence, a reduction in general business activity and increased market volatility. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and the lack of confidence in the financial markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. Our ability to properly assess the creditworthiness of our clients and to estimate the losses inherent in our credit exposure would be made more complex by these difficult market and economic conditions. Accordingly, if market conditions worsen, we may experience increases in foreclosures, delinquencies, write-offs and client bankruptcies, as well as more restricted access to funds.\nDeterioration in our local and regional economy or real estate market may adversely affect our business.\nSubstantially all of our business is with clients located within South Central Pennsylvania, principally York and Lancaster Counties and North Central Maryland, principally Harford County, Baltimore County and Baltimore City. As a result of this geographic concentration, our results depend largely on economic conditions in these and surrounding areas. Deterioration in economic conditions in these markets could:\n\uf0b7increase loan delinquencies;\n\uf0b7increase problem assets and foreclosures;\n\uf0b7increase claims and lawsuits;\n\uf0b7decrease the demand for our products and services; and\n\uf0b7decrease the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing clients\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with nonperforming loans and collateral coverage.\nGenerally, we make loans to small and mid-sized businesses whose success depends on the regional economy. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. Adverse economic and business conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate, affect our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans and, consequently, adversely affect our financial condition and performance. For example, we place substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for our loan portfolio. A sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of our loans inadequately collateralized. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings could be adversely affected.\nIf our allowance for loan and lease losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses, our earnings would decrease.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may default on their obligations. To absorb probable, incurred loan and lease losses that we may realize, we recognize an allowance for loan and lease losses based on, among other things, national and regional economic conditions, historical loss experience, and delinquency trends. However, we cannot estimate loan and lease losses with certainty, and we cannot assure you that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses. If charge-offs exceed our allowance, our earnings would decrease. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Factors that require an increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses, such as a prolonged economic downturn or continued weakening in general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control, could reduce our earnings.\nOur exposure to credit risk, which is heightened by our focus on commercial lending, could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nThere are certain risks inherent in making loans. These risks include interest rate changes over the time period in which loans may be repaid, risks resulting from changes in the economy, risks inherent in dealing with borrowers and, in the case of a loan backed by collateral, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral if a disposition is necessary.\nCommercial loans, including commercial real estate, are generally viewed as having a higher credit risk than residential real estate or consumer loans because they usually involve larger loan balances to a single borrower and are more susceptible to a risk of default during an economic downturn. Our consolidated commercial lending operations include commercial, financial and agricultural lending, real estate construction lending, and commercial mortgage lending. Construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than commercial mortgage lending. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely on the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimated property value proves to be inaccurate, the loan may be inadequately collateralized.\nBecause our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial loans, and construction loans, the deterioration of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could cause an increase in loan related legal fees and expenses, loan charge-offs and a corresponding increase in the provision for loan losses, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend primarily on net interest income for our earnings, and changes in interest rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make a profit, like that of most financial institutions, substantially depends upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates can increase or reduce net interest income and net income.\nDifferent types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to changes in market interest rates. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce net interest income. When interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Changes in market interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, unemployment, money supply, international events, and events in the United States and other financial markets.\nWe attempt to manage risk from changes in market interest rates, in part, by controlling the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities. However, interest rate risk management techniques are not exact and a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could adversely affect our financial performance. In the event that one or more of these factors were to result in a decrease in our net interest income, we do not have significant sources of fee income to make up for decreases in net interest income.\nThe planned phasing out of LIBOR as a financial benchmark presents risks to the financial instruments originated or held by the Corporation.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") is the reference rate used for many of the Corporation's transactions, including variable and adjustable rate loans and borrowings. However, a reduced volume of interbank unsecured term borrowing, coupled with recent legal and regulatory proceedings related to rate manipulation by certain financial institutions, has led to international reconsideration of LIBOR as a financial benchmark. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates the process for establishing LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that the sustainability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, the FCA intends to stop persuading, or compelling, banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021.\nRegulators, industry groups and certain communities (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating rate financial instruments. The uncertainty surrounding potential reforms, including the use of alternative\nreference rates and changes to the methods and processes used to calculate rates, may have an adverse effect on the trading market for LIBOR-based securities, loan yields, and the amount received and paid on derivative contracts and other financial instruments. In addition, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance and operational costs.\nThe Corporation formed an enterprise-wide, cross-functional project team to oversee the transition. The project team reports to Management and the Board on a periodic basis. The project team is organized around key work streams, which cover the products, systems, and operational processes impacted by the transition as well as client communications. Since its formation, the project team has completed an inventory of existing LIBOR-indexed products, which is monitored on an ongoing basis, added LIBOR fallback language to new loans, and overseen the transition to non-LIBOR based adjustable rate mortgages and floating rate commercial loans. The project team has selected SOFR as a replacement rate for LIBOR.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated, and such regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the federal deposit insurance fund, not shareholders. As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. Our bank subsidiary is also regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, and is subject to regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and recently, by regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as to consumer financial services and products. These regulations affect lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth. In addition, we have non-bank operating subsidiaries from which we derive income. One of these non-bank subsidiaries, Codorus Valley Financial Advisors, Inc. d/b/a PeoplesWealth Advisors, engages in providing investment management and insurance brokerage services, industries that are also heavily regulated on both a state and federal level. In addition, newly enacted and amended laws, regulations, and regulatory practices affecting the financial service industry may result in higher capital requirements, higher insurance premiums and limit the manner in which we may conduct our business. Such changes may adversely affect us, including our ability to offer new products and services, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and leases and achieve satisfactory spreads, and may also result in the imposition of additional costs on us. As a public corporation, we are also subject to the corporate governance standards set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as any applicable rules or regulations promulgated by the SEC and The NASDAQ Global Market.\nCompliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, affect retention of key personnel, require us to increase our regulatory capital, require us to invest significant management attention and resources and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.\nWe recently became subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for insured banks and their holding companies. The federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule, or the Final Capital Rule, that implements the Basel III capital standards and establishes the minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act. Certain capital requirements mandated by the Final Capital Rule became effective January 1, 2015. The Final Capital Rule establishes a minimum common equity Tier I capital ratio of 6.5 percent of risk-weighted assets for a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution and increases the minimum Tier I capital ratio for a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution from 6 percent to 8 percent. Additionally, the Final Capital Rule requires an institution to maintain a 2.5 percent common equity Tier I capital conservation buffer over the 6.5 percent minimum risk-based capital requirement for \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d institutions, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses, and engage in share repurchases. For bank holding companies under $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009, the Final Capital Rule permanently grandfathers trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010, subject to a limit of 25 percent of Tier I capital. The Final Capital Rule increases the required capital for certain categories of assets, including high-volatility construction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations; however, the Final Capital Rule retains the current capital treatment of residential mortgages. Implementation of these standards, or any other new regulations, may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or require us to reduce business levels or raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe soundness of other financial services institutions may adversely affect our credit risk.\nOur ability to engage in funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and failure of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to operational and credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nWe are required to make a number of judgments in applying accounting policies and different estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies could result in a decrease in capital and/or other material changes to our reports of financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, the effectiveness of derivatives and other hedging activities, and the fair value of certain financial instruments (securities, derivatives, and privately held investments), income tax assets or liabilities (including deferred tax assets and any related valuation allowance), and share-based compensation. While we have identified those accounting policies that are considered critical and have procedures in place to facilitate the associated judgments, different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in a decrease to net income and, possibly, capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict, and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. We could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively, which may result in the revision of prior financial statements by material amounts. The implementation of new or revised guidance could result in material adverse effects to our reported capital.\nWe may elect or need to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In the future, we may elect or need to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital if needed on acceptable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to expand our operations through internal growth or acquisitions could be materially impaired.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings. Information technology systems are critical to our business.\nWe use various technology systems to manage our client relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond our control such as severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, accidents, cyberattacks, terrorism, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches (including privacy breaches and cyber-attacks), but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter clients from using our products and services. Although we take protective measures, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security.\nIn addition, we outsource a significant amount of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of client information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThere have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber-attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The ability of our clients to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of clients and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or could be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures in order to ensure accurate financial control and reporting. Any system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and/or procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation and financial condition.\nWe may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations.\nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there was in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and designated nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation as described below and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.\nThe inability to hire or retain key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled individuals. We face intense competition from various other financial institutions, as well as from non-bank providers of financial services, such as credit unions, brokerage firms, insurance agencies, consumer finance companies and government organizations, for the attraction and retention of key personnel, specifically those who generate and maintain our client relationships and serve in other key operation positions in the areas of finance, credit oversight and administration, and wealth management. These competitors may offer greater compensation and benefits, which could result in the loss of potential and/or existing substantial client relationships and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these or other key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of the markets in which we operate, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nDamage to our reputation could significantly harm our business, including our competitive position and business prospects.\nWe are dependent on our reputation within our market area, as a trusted and responsible financial corporation, for all aspects of our relationships with clients, employees, vendors, third-party service providers, and others, with whom we conduct business or potential future business. Our ability to attract and retain clients and employees could be adversely affected if our reputation is damaged. Our actual or perceived failure to address various issues could give rise to reputational risk that could cause harm to us and our business prospects. These issues also include, but are not limited to, legal and regulatory requirements; properly maintaining client and employee personal information; record keeping; money-laundering; sales and trading practices; ethical issues; appropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest; and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our products. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions and legal risks, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and incur related costs and expenses.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements, which could reduce our ability to effectively compete.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to effectively embrace technological efficiencies to better serve clients and reduce costs. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, which could reduce our ability to effectively compete. Failure to keep pace with technological change could potentially have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nCompetition from other financial institutions in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing various financial services may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in originating loans, both commercial and consumer. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies, and other lenders. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages over us, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce our net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that our banking subsidiary originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, our bank subsidiary faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages over us, including greater financial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns and better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, we may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase our cost of funds.\nOur banking and non-banking subsidiaries also compete with non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance companies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our banking operations. As a result, such non-bank competitors may have advantages over our banking and non-banking subsidiaries in providing certain products and services. This competition may reduce or\nlimit our margins on banking and non-banking services, reduce our market share, and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully maintain and manage our growth.\nWe continue to execute on our acquisition and organic branching initiatives, which are intended to develop our branch infrastructure in a manner more consistent with the expansion of lending markets and to fill in and grow our branch footprint. As we continue to grow through our acquisitions, branching and other strategic initiatives, we cannot be certain as to our ability to manage increased levels of assets and liabilities. We may be required to make additional investments in equipment and personnel to manage higher asset levels and loans balances, which may adversely impact our efficiency ratio, earnings and shareholder returns.\nThe financial impact and difficulties in integrating future acquisitions could adversely affect our business.\nThe efficient and effective integration of any businesses we acquire into our organization is critical to the financial success of an acquisition transaction. Any future acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in integrating the culture, operations, technologies and personnel of the acquired companies, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of clients. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of any future acquisitions could also harm our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe impacts of COVID-19 pandemic\nIn December 2019, a coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in China, and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. Since first being reported in China, the coronavirus has spread to additional countries including the United States. On March 13, 2020, President Trump declared the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant an emergency declaration for all states, territories, and the District of Columbia.\nIn response, many state and local governments, including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Maryland, have instituted emergency restrictions that have substantially limited the operation of non-essential businesses and the activities of individuals. It has been widely reported that these restrictions have resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses, particularly those in the travel, hospitality and food and beverage industries, among many others, and has resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees nationwide and in the regions in which the Corporation operates. The ultimate effect of COVID-19 on the local or broader economy is not known nor is the ultimate length of the restrictions described and any accompanying effects. Moreover, the Federal Reserve has taken action to lower the Federal Funds rate, which has negatively affected interest income and, therefore, earnings. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak, and there is no guarantee that the Corporation\u2019s efforts to address the adverse impacts of the coronavirus will be effective. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and actions taken to contain the coronavirus or its impact, among others.\nThe effect of COVID-19 and related events, including those described above and those not yet known or knowable, could have a negative effect on the Corporation's business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, as a result of quarantines; market volatility; market downturns; changes in consumer behavior; business closures; deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers or the inability of borrowers to satisfy their obligations (and any related forbearances or restructurings that may be implemented); changes in the value of collateral securing outstanding loans; changes in the value of the investment securities portfolio; effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring and evaluating the Corporation's financial reporting and internal controls; declines in the demand for loans and other banking services and products; declines in demand resulting from adverse impacts of the disease on businesses deemed to be \"non-essential\" by governments; and branch or office closures and business interruptions.\nIn addition, the adverse economic effects of the coronavirus may lead to an increase in credit risk on the Corporation\u2019s commercial and residential loan portfolios. Likewise, the Corporation is also monitoring the fluctuations in the markets as it pertains to interest rates and fair value of our investments for other than temporary impairment (OTTI). To curtail the spread of the virus, we are currently operating with modified branch access and taking other precautionary measures.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, \u201cTemporary Relief From Troubled Debt Restructurings,\u201d provides banks the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to trouble debt restructurings (TDR) for a limited\nperiod of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. Section 541 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA) was signed into law on December 27, 2020, extending the provisions in Section 4013 of the CARES Act to January 1, 2022.\nWhile the Corporation continues to evaluate the disruption caused by the pandemic and impact of the CARES Act, these events may have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s results of future operations, financial position, capital, and liquidity in fiscal year 2022. Further, a decrease in results of future operations may place a strain on the Corporation\u2019s capital reserve ratios.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and/or the actions of activist shareholders.\nIn February 2022, Driver Company Management (\u201cDCM\u201d) notified the Corporation of its intent to nominate three candidates for election to our Board of Directors at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Although our Board of Directors has not made its recommendation with respect to the director election at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, it is possible that a proxy contest involving DCM will ensure, or that we could become engaged in a proxy contest with another activist shareholder in the future. A potential proxy contest for the election of directors or related activities on the part of DCM or other activist shareholders could be time-consuming and may result in the Corporation incurring substantial costs, including proxy solicitation, public relations, and legal and advisory fees. Further, such a proxy contest or related activities could divert the attention of our Board of Directors, senior management, and employees. The actions of DCM and other activist shareholders may also create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy, which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, may make it more difficult to pursue strategic initiatives and may impact our relationship with investors, business partners, customers and other third parties. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of a proxy contest or matters arising from a proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our Board of Directors, senior management and employees and would require us to incur significant additional costs. A proxy contest or related activities could also impact the market price and the volatility of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market constantly changes. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate and there can be no assurance about the market prices for our common stock.\nStock price volatility may make it difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\uf0b7actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations or quality of our assets;\n\uf0b7recommendations by securities analysts;\n\uf0b7operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\uf0b7any failure to pay dividends on our common stock or a reduction in cash dividends;\n\uf0b7continued levels of loan quality and volume origination;\n\uf0b7the adequacy of loan loss reserves;\n\uf0b7the willingness of clients to substitute competitors\u2019 products and services for our products and services and vice versa, based on price, quality, relationship or otherwise;\n\uf0b7interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations;\n\uf0b7declines in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired;\n\uf0b7the timely development of competitive new products and services by us and the acceptance of such products and services by clients;\n\uf0b7changes in consumer spending and saving habits relative to the financial services we provide;\n\uf0b7relationships with major clients;\n\uf0b7our ability to continue to grow our business internally and through acquisition and successful integration of new or acquired entities while controlling costs;\n\uf0b7news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including the failures of other financial institutions in the current economic downturn;\n\uf0b7perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\uf0b7rapidly changing technology, or new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\uf0b7deposit flows;\n\uf0b7changes in accounting principles, policies and guidelines;\n\uf0b7significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\uf0b7changes in and compliance with laws and government regulations of federal, state and local agencies;\n\uf0b7effects of climate change;\n\uf0b7geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts;\n\uf0b7natural disasters or severe weather conditions;\n\uf0b7health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics;\n\uf0b7cyber breaches or breaches of physical premises, including data centers;\n\uf0b7failure to retain or attract key personnel;\n\uf0b7operating results that vary from the expectations of management, analysts and investors;\n\uf0b7future sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n\uf0b7the credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and\n\uf0b7the relatively low trading volume of our common stock.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results as evidenced by the current volatility and disruption of capital and credit markets.\nThe trading volume of our common stock may not provide adequate liquidity for investors and is less than that of other financial services companies.\nOur common stock is listed under the symbol \u201cCVLY\u201d on the NASDAQ Global Market. The average daily trading volume for shares of our common stock is less than larger financial institutions. As a result, sales of our common stock may place significant downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, it may be difficult for holders to resell their shares at prices they find attractive, or at all.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.\nIn order to maintain our capital at desired or regulatory-required levels or to replace existing capital, we may be required to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock. Generally, we are not restricted from issuing such additional shares. We may sell any shares that we issue at prices below the current market price of our common stock, and the sale of these shares may significantly dilute shareholder ownership. We could also issue additional shares in connection with acquisitions of other financial institutions or in connection with our equity compensation plans. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both.\nOfferings of debt and/or preferred equity securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may attempt to increase our capital resources or, if our or our subsidiary bank\u2019s capital ratios fall below the required minimums, we could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including medium-term notes, trust preferred securities, senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings are likely to receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of the shareholders. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to\nset the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding up and liquidation and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and preferred stock, and effectively subordinated to all the indebtedness and other non-common equity claims against our subsidiaries.\nShares of our common stock are equity interests in us and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, shares of our common stock rank junior to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims against us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us, including in our liquidation. Additionally, holders of our common stock could be subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our preferred stock. Furthermore, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of our subsidiaries\u2019 liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\nWe may attempt to increase our capital resources or, if our or the Bank\u2019s capital ratios fall below the required minimums, we could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including medium-term notes, trust-preferred securities, senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings are likely to receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock.\nWe are currently authorized to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of common stock of which 9,472,404 shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2021, and up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which were outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Our board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders of common stock, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares. Authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock could be issued on terms or in circumstances that could dilute the interests of other shareholders.\nRegulatory and contractual restrictions may limit or prevent us from paying dividends or repurchasing, or we may choose not to pay dividends on or repurchase, our common stock.\nThe Company is an entity separate and distinct from its principal subsidiary, PeoplesBank, and we derive substantially all of our revenue in the form of dividends from that subsidiary. Accordingly, we are and will be dependent upon dividends from PeoplesBank to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, to satisfy our other cash needs and to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements. In the event PeoplesBank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to pay dividends on our common or preferred stock. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including those of its depositors.\nAs described below in the next risk factor, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from paying dividends on or repurchasing our common stock at any time when we have elected to defer the payment of interest on such debt securities or certain events of default under the terms of those debt securities have occurred and are continuing. These restrictions could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock. Moreover, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as and if declared by our board of directors.\nAlthough we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce, suspend or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future. No determination has been made by our board of directors regarding whether or what amount of dividends will be paid in future quarters. Additionally, there can be no assurance that regulatory approval will be granted by the Federal Reserve Board to pay dividends. Future payment of cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as the board may deem relevant and will be subject to applicable federal and state laws that impose restrictions on our and our bank subsidiary\u2019s ability to pay dividends, as well as guidance issued from time to time by regulatory authorities.\nUnder guidance issued by the Federal Reserve, as a bank holding company we are to consult the Federal Reserve before declaring dividends and are to strongly consider eliminating, deferring, or reducing dividends we pay to our shareholders if (1) our net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (2) our prospective rate of earnings retention is not\nconsistent with our capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (3) we will not meet, or are in danger of not meeting, our minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nIf we defer payments of interest on our outstanding subordinated notes or junior subordinated debt securities or if certain defaults relating to those debt securities occur, we will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on, and from making liquidation payments with respect to, our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $31,000,000 outstanding aggregate principal amount of subordinated debt evidenced by subordinated notes and note purchase agreements and $10,310,000 outstanding aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated debt securities issued in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities by certain of our subsidiaries that are statutory business trusts. We have also guaranteed those trust preferred securities. There are currently two separate series of these junior subordinated debt securities outstanding, each series having been issued under a separate indenture and with a separate guarantee. The note purchase agreements and each of these indentures, together with the related guarantee, prohibits us, subject to limited exceptions, from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on, or redeeming, repurchasing, acquiring or making any liquidation payments with respect to, any of our capital stock at any time when (i) there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default under the note purchase agreement or indenture or any event, act or condition that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute an event of default under the note purchase agreement or indenture; or (ii) we are in default with respect to payment of any obligations under the related guarantee; or (iii) we have deferred payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities outstanding under that indenture. In that regard, we are entitled, at our option but subject to certain conditions, to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities of each series from time to time for up to five years.\nEvents of default under each note purchase agreement and indenture generally consists of our failure to pay interest on the subordinated notes or junior subordinated debt securities outstanding under the indenture under certain circumstances, our failure to pay any principal of or premium on such subordinated notes or junior subordinated debt securities when due, our failure to comply with certain covenants under the note purchase agreements or indenture, and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation relating to us or the Bank.\nAs a result of these provisions, if we were to elect to defer payments of interest on any series of junior subordinated debt securities, or if any of the other events described in clause (i) or (ii) of the first paragraph of this risk factor were to occur, we would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on our common stock, from redeeming, repurchasing or otherwise acquiring any of our common stock, and from making any payments to holders of our common stock in the event of our liquidation, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock. Moreover, without notice to or consent from the holders of our common stock, we may issue additional series of subordinated notes or junior subordinated debt securities in the future with terms similar to those of our existing subordinated notes or junior subordinated debt securities or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to purchase or to pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our common stock.\nOur common stock is not insured by any governmental entity.\nOur common stock is not a deposit account or other obligation of any bank and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund, any other governmental entity or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this document and our other filings with the SEC, and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you may lose some or all of your investment.\nAnti-takeover provisions and restrictions on ownership could negatively impact our shareholders.\nProvisions of federal and Pennsylvania law and our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our shareholders. In addition, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHCA, requires any bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring more than 5 percent of our outstanding common stock. Any person other than a bank holding company is required to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve to acquire 10 percent or more of our outstanding common stock under the Change in Bank Control Act. Any holder of 25 percent or more of our outstanding common stock, other than an individual, is subject to regulation as a bank holding company under the BHCA.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may have the effect of deterring or discouraging an attempt to take control of the Company. Among other things, these provisions:\n\uf0b7empower our board of directors, without shareholder approval, to issue shares of our common or preferred stock the terms of which, including voting power, are set by our board;\n\uf0b7divide our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms;\n\uf0b7authorize our board of directors to oppose a tender or other offer for the Company\u2019s securities if the board determines that such an offer should be rejected;\n\uf0b7require the affirmative vote of holders of at least 75 percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock to approve merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, excepting transactions described above that are approved by at least 80 percent of the members of the Board of Directors, where such transactions shall only require shareholder approval by a majority of the votes cast at the shareholders meeting;\n\uf0b7eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\uf0b7require advance notice of nominations for the election of directors and the presentation of shareholder proposals at meetings of shareholders.", "PERMNO": 84725, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CVLY"}
