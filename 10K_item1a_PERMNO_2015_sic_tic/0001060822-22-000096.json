RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC in evaluating our business. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impact our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our operating results may be affected.\nRisks Related to Global and Macroeconomic Conditions\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other global crises have had and may in the future have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGlobal crises, including political instability or other global events that result in the disruption of trade, the production and distribution of our products, or our sales operations, have had and may in the future have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFor example, in December 2019, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (including variants, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d) began in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and a national emergency was declared in the United States and many other countries. National, state, and local governments and private entities mandated and continue to mandate various restrictions as new waves of the pandemic and new strains of the virus spread across the globe, including travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, stay at home orders and advisories, and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant disruption of the financial and retail markets, including increased unemployment rates and a disruption in consumer demand for baby and children\u2019s clothing and accessories. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 have had, and will likely continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the effectiveness and availability of vaccines and boosters, and the efficacy, scope, and duration of other actions to limit the spread of COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others.\nSimilarly, we are also subject to general political and economic risks in connection with our global operations, including political instability, terrorist attacks, and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, any of which may have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is sensitive to overall levels of consumer spending, particularly in the young children\u2019s apparel market.\nBoth retail and wholesale consumer demand for young children\u2019s apparel and accessories, specifically brand name apparel products, is affected by the overall level of consumer spending. Overall spending in the market is affected by a number of global and macroeconomic factors, such as overall economic conditions and employment levels, uncertainty in the political climate, gasoline and utility costs, business conditions, availability of consumer credit, tax rates, the availability of tax credits, interest rates, inflationary pressures, levels of consumer indebtedness, foreign currency exchange rates, weather, and overall levels of consumer confidence. We have experienced many of these factors due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the related responses of national, state, and local government and public health officials. Furthermore, any increases in consumer discretionary spending during times of crisis may be temporary, such as those related to government stimulus programs, including programs specifically targeted to assist families with young children. Additionally, birth rate fluctuations, which in turn affect the number of customers that are acquired and retained, can have a material impact on consumer spending and our business. For instance, in recent years we have seen a reduction in the birth rate in the United States, and a reduction in the size of the market for young children\u2019s apparel and accessories. Reductions, or lower-than-expected growth, in the level of discretionary or overall consumer spending may have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Brands and Product Value\nThe acceptance of our products in the marketplace is affected by consumer tastes and preferences, along with fashion trends.\nWe believe that our continued success depends on our ability to create products that provide a compelling value proposition for our consumers in all of our distribution channels. There can be no assurance that the demand for our products will not decline, or that we will be able to successfully and timely evaluate and adapt our products to changes in consumer tastes and preferences\nor fashion trends. If demand for our products declines, promotional pricing may be required to sell out-of-season or excess merchandise, and our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position, and adversely affect our results.\nWe currently rely on a combination of trademark, unfair competition, and copyright laws, as well as licensing and vendor arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property assets and rights. The steps taken by us or by our licensees and vendors to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent either the counterfeit production of our products or the infringement of our trademarks or proprietary rights by others. In addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights and where third parties may have rights to conflicting trademarks, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in those countries. If we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brands could be diminished, and our competitive position may suffer. Further, third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business geographically or through acquisitions, and any such claim could be expensive and time consuming to defend, regardless of its merit. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe value of our brands, and our sales, could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity, including through actions by our employees, and our vendors, third-party manufacturers, and licensees, over whom we have limited control.\nAlthough we maintain policies with our employees, vendors, third-party manufacturers, and licensees that promote ethical business practices, and our employees, agents, and third-party compliance auditors periodically visit and monitor the operations of these entities, we do not control our vendors, third-party manufacturers, or licensees, or their practices. A violation of our vendor policies, licensee agreements, health and safety standards, labor laws, anti-bribery laws, or other policies or laws by these employees, vendors, third-party manufacturers, or licensees could damage the image and reputation of our brands and could subject us to liability. As a result, negative publicity regarding us or our brands or products, including licensed products, could adversely affect our reputation and sales. Further, while we take steps to ensure the reputations of our brands are maintained through license and vendor agreements, there can be no guarantee that our brand image will not be negatively affected through its association with products or actions of our licensees or vendors.\nWe may experience delays, product recalls, or loss of revenues if our products do not meet our quality standards.\nFrom time to time, we receive shipments of product from our third-party vendors that fail to conform to our quality control standards. A failure in our quality control program may result in diminished inventory levels and product quality, which in turn may result in increased order cancellations and product returns, decreased consumer demand for our products, or product recalls, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, products that fail to meet our standards, or other unauthorized products, could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge. This could materially harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace.\nRisks Related to Operating a Global Business\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can.\nThe global baby and young children\u2019s apparel and accessories market is very competitive and includes both branded and private label manufacturers. Because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with many other manufacturers and retailers including in certain instances some of our wholesale accounts. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and larger customer bases than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, and adopt more aggressive pricing strategies than we can.\nFinancial difficulties for, or the loss of one or more of, our major wholesale customers could result in a material loss of revenues.\nA significant amount of our business is with our wholesale customers. For fiscal 2021, we derived approximately 32% of our consolidated net sales from our U.S. Wholesale segment and approximately 32% of our consolidated net sales from our top ten wholesale customers. As of the end of fiscal 2021, approximately 80% of our gross accounts receivable were from our ten largest wholesale customers, with three of these customers having individual receivable balances in excess of 10% of our total\naccounts receivable. Furthermore, we do not enter into long-term sales contracts with our major wholesale customers, relying instead on product performance, long-standing relationships, and our position in the marketplace.\nAs we have experienced in the past, we face the risk that if one or more of these customers significantly decreases their business or terminates their relationship with us as a result of financial difficulties (including bankruptcy or insolvency), competitive forces, consolidation, reorganization, or other reasons, then we may have significant levels of excess inventory that we may not be able to place elsewhere, a material decrease in our sales, or material impact on our operating results. In addition, our reserves for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments may prove not to be sufficient if any one or more of our customers are unable to meet outstanding obligations to us, which could materially adversely affect our operating results. If the financial condition or credit position of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate, or such customer fails, or is unable to pay the amounts owed to us in a timely manner, this could have a significant adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur retail success is dependent upon identifying locations and negotiating appropriate lease terms for retail stores.\nA significant portion of our revenues is through our retail stores in leased retail locations across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Successful operation of a retail store depends, in part, on the overall ability of the retail location to attract a consumer base sufficient to generate profitable store sales volumes. If we are unable to identify new retail locations with consumer traffic sufficient to support a profitable sales level, our retail growth may be limited. Some new stores may be located in areas where we have existing sales channels. Increasing the number of stores in these markets may result in inadvertent diversion of customers and sales from our existing sales channels in the same market, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations. Further, if existing stores do not maintain a sufficient customer base that provides a reasonable sales volume or we are unable to negotiate appropriate lease terms for the retail stores, there could be a material adverse impact on our sales, gross margin, and results of operations. In addition, if consumer shopping preferences transition more from brick-and-mortar stores to online retail experiences, with us or other retailers, any increase we may see in our eCommerce sales may not be sufficient to offset the decreases in sales from our brick-and-mortar stores.\nWe also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases on acceptable terms. In addition, from time to time, particularly in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we may seek to renegotiate existing lease terms or downsize, consolidate, reposition, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to renew existing store leases, secure adequate new lease terms, or successfully modify existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options and renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur eCommerce business faces distinct risks, and our failure to successfully manage it could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nThe successful operation of our eCommerce business as well as our ability to provide a positive shopping experience that will generate orders and drive subsequent visits depends on efficient and uninterrupted operation of our order-taking and fulfillment operations. Risks associated with our eCommerce business in the United States, Canada, and Mexico include:\n\u2022the failure of the computer systems, including those of third-party vendors, that operate our eCommerce sites and mobile applications, including, among others, inadequate system capacity, service outages, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, security breaches, system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems;\n\u2022disruptions in telecommunications services or power outages;\n\u2022reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software, as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers on-time and without damage;\n\u2022limitations of shipping volumes which may be imposed by service providers;\n\u2022rapid technology changes;\n\u2022the failure to deliver products to customers on-time and within customers\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022credit or debit card, or other electronic payment-type, fraud, or disruptions in payment systems;\n\u2022the diversion of sales from our physical stores;\n\u2022natural disasters or adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022changes in applicable federal, state and international regulations;\n\u2022liability for online content; and\n\u2022consumer privacy concerns and regulation.\nProblems in any of these areas could result in a reduction in sales, increased costs and damage to our reputation and brands, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, in fiscal 2021 we experienced a decrease in net sales in our eCommerce channel compared to fiscal 2020. Our eCommerce business may continue to be negatively impacted if consumers shift back to traditional brick-and-mortal retail after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nProfitability and our reputation and relationships could be negatively affected if we do not adequately forecast the demand for our products and, as a result, create significant levels of excess inventory or insufficient levels of inventory.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions and, as a result, we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements. If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs (which occurred, for example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and negatively impact profitability. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, our third-party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to our reputation and relationships. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image, as well as our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins, including deflationary pressures on our selling prices and increases in production costs and costs to serve.\nThe global apparel industry is subject to pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, the promotional retail environment, and changes in consumer demand. The demand for baby and young children\u2019s apparel and accessories in particular may also be subject to other external factors, such as general inflationary pressures, as well as the costs of our products, which are driven in part by the costs of raw materials (including cotton and other commodities), labor, fuel, transportation and duties, any increases in mandatory minimum wages, and the costs to deliver those products to our customers. If external pressures, including deflation, cause us to reduce our sales prices and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, or if we are unable to fully optimize prices or pass on increased costs to our customers, our profitability could decline. Additionally, while deflation could positively impact our product costs, it could have an adverse effect on our average selling prices per unit, resulting in lower sales and operating results. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on costs, such as raw materials, labor, and transportation costs, which may impact our expenses and profitability.\nWe rely on vendors, distribution resources and transportation providers. In fiscal 2021 and the early part of 2022, the costs of raw materials, packaging materials, labor, energy, fuel, transportation, and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products have rapidly increased. We also expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2022.\nOur attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume, as consumers may choose less expensive options, or forego some purchases altogether, during an economic downturn. To the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business, financial condition, or operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur revenues, product costs, and other expenses are subject to foreign economic and currency risks due to our operations outside of the United States.\nWe have operations in Canada, Mexico, and Asia, and our vendors, third-party manufacturers, and licensees are located around the world. The value of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies has experienced significant volatility in recent years. While our business is primarily conducted in U.S. dollars, we source substantially all of our production from Asia, and we generate significant revenues in Canada. Cost increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations could make our products\nless competitive or have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the businesses of our third-party manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials or products more expensive and more difficult to finance. Additionally, fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of our reported sales and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business could suffer a material adverse effect from unseasonable or extreme weather conditions, or other effects of climate change.\nOur business is susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions, which could influence customer demand, consumer traffic, and shopping habits. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool temperatures during the summer season have in the past and could in the future affect the timing of and reduce or shift demand for our products, and thereby could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial position, and cash flows. In addition, extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial position, and cash flows. For example, frequent or unusually heavy or intense snowfall, flooding, hurricanes, or other extreme weather conditions over an extended period have caused and could in the future cause our stores to close for a period of time or permanently, and could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores or to receive products shipped to them, which in turn could negatively impact our operating results.\nIn addition, there is concern that climate changes could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. These changes may increase the effects described above, and changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key materials, such as cotton. Public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation, and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nRisk Relating to Litigation\nWe are and may become subject to various claims and pending or threatened lawsuits, including as a result of investigations or other proceedings related to previously disclosed investigations.\nWe are subject to various claims and pending or threatened lawsuits in the course of our business, including claims that our designs infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. We are also affected by trends in litigation, including class action litigation brought under various laws, including consumer protection, employment, and privacy and information security laws. In addition, litigation risks related to claims that technologies we use infringe intellectual property rights of third parties have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose primary business is to assert such claims. Reserves are established based on our best estimates of our potential liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation. Regardless of the outcome or whether the claims are meritorious, legal and regulatory proceedings may require that management devote substantial time and expense to defend the Company. In the event we are required or determine to pay amounts in connection with any such claims or lawsuits, such amounts could exceed applicable insurance coverage, if any, or contractual rights available to us. As a result, such lawsuits could be significant and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, as previously reported, in 2009 the SEC and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office began conducting investigations, with which we cooperated, related to customer margin support provided by us, including undisclosed margin support commitments and related matters. In December 2010, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SEC pursuant to which the SEC agreed not to charge us with any violations of federal securities laws, commence any enforcement action against us, or require us to pay any financial penalties in connection with the SEC investigation of customer margin support provided by us, conditioned upon our continued cooperation with the SEC\u2019s investigation and with any related proceedings. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial expenses for legal services due to the SEC and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office investigations and any related proceedings. These matters may continue to divert management\u2019s time and attention away from operations. We also expect to bear additional costs pursuant to our advancement and indemnification obligations to directors and officers under the terms of our organizational documents in connection with proceedings related to these matters. Our insurance may not provide coverage to offset all of the costs incurred in connection with these proceedings.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, and Information Technology\nOur systems, and those of our third-party vendors, containing personal information and payment data of our retail store and eCommerce customers, employees, and other third parties could be breached, which could subject us to adverse publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation, and expenses.\nWe rely on the security of our networks, databases, systems, and processes to protect our proprietary information and information about our customers, employees, and vendors, including customer payment information. We have established physical, electronic, and organizational measures to safeguard and secure our systems to prevent data compromise and rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for our IT systems and the processing, transmission and storage of digital information. We have also outsourced elements of our IT systems, including to cloud-based solution vendors, and, as a result, a number of third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information. Our IT systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including physical damage, telecommunications or network failures or interruptions, system malfunction, natural disasters, malicious human acts, terrorism, and war, and we have experienced interruptions in the past. These systems, including our servers, are also vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party service providers, contractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information).\nCyber criminals are constantly devising schemes to circumvent information technology security safeguards and other retailers have recently suffered serious data security breaches. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, or hostile foreign governments or agencies. It is possible that we or our third-party vendors may experience cybersecurity and other breach incidents that remain undetected for an extended period. Even when a security breach is detected, the full extent of the breach may not be determined immediately. The costs to us to mitigate network security issues, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and, while we have implemented security measures to protect our IT and data security infrastructure, our efforts to address these issues may not be successful.\nIf unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases, or those of our vendors, they may be able to steal, publish, delete, modify, or block our access to our private and sensitive internal and third-party information, including payment information and personally identifiable information. In such circumstances, we could be held liable to our customers, other parties, or employees as well as be subject to regulatory or other actions for breaching privacy law (including the E.U. General Data Protection Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act) or failing to adequately protect such information. This could result in costly investigations and litigation exceeding applicable insurance coverage or contractual rights available to us, civil or criminal penalties, operational changes, or other response measures, loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, and negative publicity that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. Further, if we are unable to comply with the security standards established by banks and the payment processing industry, we may be subject to fines, restrictions, and expulsion from payment acceptance programs, which could adversely affect our retail operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. If our IT systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are also reliant on the security practices of our third-party service providers, which may be outside of our direct control. The services provided by these third parties are subject to the same risk of outages, other failures and security breaches described above. If these third parties fail to adhere to adequate security practices, or experience a breach of their systems, the data of our employees and customers may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. In addition, our third-party providers may take actions beyond our control that could harm our business, including discontinuing or limiting our access to one or more services, increasing pricing terms, terminating, or seeking to terminate our contractual relationship altogether, or altering how we are able to process data in a way that is unfavorable or costly to us. Although we expect that we could obtain similar services from other third parties, if our arrangements with our current providers were terminated, we could experience interruptions in our business, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging for alternative cloud infrastructure services. Any loss or\ninterruption to our systems or the services provided by third parties would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to implement new information technology systems or needed upgrades to our systems, including operational and financial systems, could adversely affect our business.\nAs our business continues to grow in size, complexity, and geographic footprint, we have enhanced and upgraded our information technology infrastructure and we expect there to be a regular need for additional enhancements and upgrades as we continue to grow. Failure to implement new systems or upgrade systems, including operational and financial systems, as needed or complications encountered in implementing new systems or upgrading existing systems could cause disruptions that may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, additional investments needed to upgrade and expand our information technology infrastructure may require significant investment of additional resources and capital, which may not always be available or available on favorable terms.\nRisks Related to our Global Supply Chain and Labor Force\nWe source substantially all of our products through foreign production arrangements. Our dependence on foreign supply sources are subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing which could result in disruptions to our operations.\nWe source substantially all of our products through a network of vendors primarily in Asia, principally coordinated by our Hong Kong sourcing office. Our global supply chain could be negatively affected due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022political instability or other global events resulting in the disruption of operations or trade in or with foreign countries from which we source our products;\n\u2022the occurrence of a natural disaster, unusual weather conditions, or a disease epidemic in foreign countries from which we source our products;\n\u2022financial instability, including bankruptcy or insolvency, of one or more of our major vendors;\n\u2022the imposition of new laws and regulations relating to imports, duties, taxes, and other charges on imports, including those that the U.S. government has implemented and may further implement on imports from China;\n\u2022increased costs of raw materials (including cotton and other commodities), labor, fuel, and transportation;\n\u2022interruptions in the supply of raw materials, including cotton, fabric, and trim items;\n\u2022increases in the cost of labor in our sourcing locations;\n\u2022changes in the U.S. customs procedures concerning the importation of apparel products;\n\u2022unforeseen delays in customs clearance of any goods;\n\u2022disruptions in the global transportation network, such as a port strikes or delays, work stoppages or other labor unrest, capacity withholding, world trade restrictions, acts of terrorism, or war;\n\u2022the application of adverse foreign intellectual property laws;\n\u2022the ability of our vendors to secure sufficient credit to finance the manufacturing process, including the acquisition of raw materials;\n\u2022potential social compliance concerns resulting from our use of international vendors, third-party manufacturers, and licensees, over whom we have limited control;\n\u2022manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for products may require the use of faster, but more expensive, transportation methods, such as air-freight services; and\n\u2022other events beyond our control that could interrupt our supply chain and delay receipt of our products into the United States, Canada, and Mexico, as well as the ninety additional countries in which our international partners and international wholesale customers operate.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could result in disruptions to our operations, which in turn could increase our cost of goods sold, decrease our gross profit, or impact our ability to deliver to our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and continues to impact global supply chain operations, causing delays in the production and transportation of our product. For example, in fiscal 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse effect on our sourcing operations, particularly in China and the rest of Asia, and has slowed our ability to import products into North America. In addition, in\nfiscal 2021, we experienced increased inbound transportation and freight costs, and we expect these increased costs to continue and to adversely impact our financial and operating results in fiscal 2022.\nAlso, in fiscal 2020 and 2021, the U.S. Government placed sanctions on China\u2019s Xinjiang Production and Construction Corporation (\u201cXPCC\u201d) for human rights violations and took other significant steps to address the forced labor concerns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (the \u201cXUAR\u201d) of China, including withhold release orders issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, (\u201cUS CBP\u201d), which may in turn have an adverse effect on global supply chains, including our own supply chains for cotton and cotton-containing products, and the price of cotton in the marketplace. The XUAR is the source of large amounts of cotton and textiles for the global apparel supply chain. Although we do not knowingly source any products from the XUAR and we have no known involvement with China\u2019s Xinjiang Production and Construction Corporation (\u201cXPCC\u201d) or its affiliates, we could be subject to penalties, fines or sanctions if any of the vendors from which we purchase goods is found or suspected to have dealings, directly or indirectly, with XPCC or entities with which it may be affiliated. Additionally, our products have been and, in the future, could be held or delayed by the US CBP under the withhold release orders, which would cause delays and unexpectedly affect our inventory levels. Even if we were not subject to penalties, fines, or sanctions, if products we source are associated in any way to XPCC or the XUAR, our reputation could be damaged.\nA relatively small number of vendors supply a significant amount of our products, and losing one or more of these vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn fiscal 2021, we purchased approximately 54% of our products from ten vendors, of which approximately half comes from three vendors. Additionally, we estimate that approximately 80% of the fabric that is used in the manufacture of our products is sourced from China. We expect that we will continue to source a significant portion of our products from these vendors. We do not have agreements with our major vendors that would provide us with assurances on a long-term basis as to adequate supply or pricing of our products. If any of our major vendors decide to discontinue or significantly decrease the volume of products they manufacture for us, raise prices on products we purchase from them, or become unable to perform their responsibilities (e.g., if our vendors become insolvent or experience financial difficulties, manufacturing capacity constraints, significant labor disputes, or restrictions imposed by foreign governments) our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nLabor or other disruptions along our supply chain may adversely affect our relationships with customers, reputation with consumers, and results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. Labor disputes at third-party factories where our goods are produced, the shipping ports we use, or within our transportation carriers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes, or other disruptions during our peak manufacturing and importing times. For example, we source a significant portion of our products through a single port on the west coast of the United States. Work slowdowns and stoppages relating to labor agreement negotiations involving the operators of this west coast port and unions have in the past resulted in a significant backlog of cargo containers entering the United States. We have also shifted some of our product deliveries to other ports of entry which may experience volume increases that may create delays at these ports that did not exist before we, and others, shifted significant volume to them. Further, in the past, the insolvency of a major shipping company has also had an effect on our supply chain. As a result, we have in the past experienced delays in the shipment of our products. In the event that these slow-downs, disruptions or strikes occur in the future in connection with labor agreement negotiations or otherwise, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur inability to effectively source and manage inventory could negatively impact our ability to timely deliver our inventory supply and disrupt our business, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe source all of our products from a global network of third-party suppliers. If we experience significant increases in demand, or need to replace an existing vendor or shift production to vendors in new countries, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new vendors, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in producing our products and adhering to our quality control standards. In the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials (including cotton) used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, such as an inability to source from a particular vendor or geographic region, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows.\nAdditionally, the nature of our business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels, and to support our retail omni-channel strategies, including our buy on-line and pick-up in store program. Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases and allocations to our sales channels. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers\u2019 preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned margins, and too little inventory may result in lost sales.\nOur Braselton, Georgia distribution facility handles a large portion of our merchandise distribution. If we encounter problems with this facility, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected.\nWe handle a large portion of our merchandise distribution for our U.S. stores and our eCommerce operations from our facility in Braselton, Georgia. Our ability to meet consumer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on proper operation of this facility. If we are not able to distribute merchandise to our stores or customers because we have exceeded our capacity at our distribution facility (such as a high level of demand during peak periods) or because of natural disasters, health issues, accidents, system failures, disruptions, or other events, our sales could decline, which may have a materially adverse effect on our earnings, financial position, and our reputation. We experienced an increase of COVID-19 cases in this facility in connection with the Delta and Omicron variants, which negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect capacity. Additionally, we have experienced significant competition in hiring employees for this facility, which we attribute to the impacts of COVID-19 and to increased competition and rising wages. To address this, we have increased wages and implemented other policies in order to retain existing employees and attract additional employees. These wage increases impacted our operating results. We are likely to continue to face challenges in hiring employees for this facility due to increased competition and we may incur additional employee-related costs, when necessary, which would impact our operating results. These staffing difficulties have caused and may in the future cause additional capacity constraints. Surges in COVID-19 cases among employees could also affect the capacity of this facility, and therefore our operating results. Additionally, if we are unable to adequately staff this facility to meet demand, or if the cost of such staffing is higher than projected due to competition, mandated wage increases, regulatory changes, or other factors, our operating results may be further harmed.\nIn addition, we use an automated system that manages the order processing for our eCommerce business. In the event that this system becomes inoperable for any reason, we may be unable to ship orders in a timely manner, and as a result, we could experience a reduction in our direct-to-consumer business, which could negatively impact our sales and profitability.\nRisks Relating to Our International Expansion\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding into international markets.\nWe cannot be sure that we can successfully complete any planned international expansion or that new international business will be profitable or meet our expectations. We do not have significant experience operating in markets outside of North America. Consumer demand, behavior, tastes, and purchasing trends may differ in international markets and, as a result, sales of our products may not be successful or meet our expectations, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. We may encounter differences in business culture and the legal environment that may make working with commercial partners and hiring and retaining an adequate employee base more challenging. We may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations with our current operations. Significant changes in foreign laws or relations, such as political uncertainty and potential trade wars between nations in which we operate, may also hinder our success in new markets. Our entry into new markets may have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and such costs may be greater than expected. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, our results could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Changes\nFailure to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and standards set by various governmental authorities around the world, including in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, including:\n\u2022those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC, and the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d);\n\u2022the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar world-wide anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022health care, employment and labor laws;\n\u2022product and consumer safety laws, including those imposed by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n\u2022data privacy laws, including the E.U. General Data Protection Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act;\n\u2022trade, transportation and logistics related laws, including tariffs and orders issued by Customs and Border Protection; and\n\u2022applicable environmental laws.\nOur failure to comply with these various laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, these laws, regulations, and standards may change from time to time, and the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate may increase. Although we undertake to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors, or agents, we could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties under the controlling regulations, any of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Also, our inability, or that of our vendors, to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements could result in product recalls, or significant fines or penalties, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation and sales, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Issues with respect to the compliance of merchandise we sell with these regulations and standards, regardless of our culpability or customer concerns about such issues, could result in damage to our reputation, lost sales, uninsured product liability claims or losses, product recalls, and increased costs.\nRisks Related to Executing Our Strategic Plan\nOur failure to properly manage strategic initiatives in order to achieve our objectives may negatively impact our business.\nThe implementation of our business strategy periodically involves the execution of complex initiatives, such as acquisitions, which may require that we make significant estimates and assumptions about a project. These projects could place significant demands on our accounting, financial, information technology, and other systems, and on our business overall. We are dependent on our management\u2019s ability to oversee these projects effectively and implement them successfully. If our estimates and assumptions about a project are incorrect, or if we miscalculate the resources or time we need to complete a project or fail to implement a project effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nFor example, our multi-channel global business model, which includes retail store, eCommerce, and wholesale sales channels, enables us to reach a broad range of consumers around the world. This strategy has and will continue to require significant investment in cross-functional operations and management focus, along with investment in supporting technologies. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must anticipate and meet changing customer expectations and address new developments and technology investments by our competitors. Our omni-channel retailing strategy includes implementing new technology, software, and processes to be able to fulfill customer orders from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers, which is extremely complex and may not meet customer expectations for timely and accurate deliveries. If we are unable to attract and retain employees or contract with third-parties having the specialized skills needed to support our multi-channel efforts, implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, allow real-time and accurate visibility to product availability when customers are ready to purchase, quickly and efficiently fulfill our customers' orders using the fulfillment and payment methods they demand, or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if our retail eCommerce sites or our other customer-facing technology systems do not appeal to our customers, reliably function as designed, or maintain the privacy of customer data, or if we are unable to consistently meet our brand and delivery promises to our customers, we may experience a loss of customer confidence or lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nOur success is dependent upon retaining key individuals within the organization to execute our strategic plan.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified executive management, marketing, merchandising, design, sourcing, operations, including distribution center and retail store, and support function staffing is key to our success. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future, or that the compensation costs of doing so will not adversely affect our operating results. We have paid special bonuses across our workforce and have increased, and may continue to increase, our employee compensation and benefits levels in response to competition, as necessary. Our inability to retain personnel could cause us to experience business disruption due to a loss of historical knowledge and a lack of business continuity and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses, and such acquisitions may fail to achieve the financial results we expected.\nFrom time to time we may acquire other businesses as part of our growth strategy, such as our acquisitions of the Skip Hop brand and our Mexican licensee in fiscal 2017, and we may partially or fully fund future acquisitions by taking on additional debt. We may be unable to successfully integrate businesses we acquire and such acquisitions may fail to achieve the financial results we expected. Integrating completed acquisitions into our existing operations, particularly larger acquisitions, involves numerous risks, including harmonizing divergent technology platforms, diversion of our management attention, failure to retain key personnel and customers, and failure of the acquired business to be financially successful. In addition, we cannot be certain of the extent of any unknown or contingent liabilities of any acquired business, including liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws, such as those relating to product safety, anti-bribery or anti-corruption. We may incur material liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses. Also, depending on the location of the acquired business, we may be required to comply with laws and regulations that may differ from those of the jurisdictions in which our operations are currently conducted. Our inability to successfully integrate businesses we acquire, or if such businesses do not achieve the financial results we expect, may increase our costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financial Reporting, Our Debt, and Tax\nWe may not achieve sales growth plans, profitability objectives, and other assumptions that support the carrying value of our intangible assets.\nThe carrying values of our goodwill and tradename assets are subject to annual impairment reviews as of the last day of each fiscal year or more frequently, if deemed necessary, due to any significant events or changes in circumstances. Estimated future cash flows used in these impairment reviews could be negatively affected if we do not achieve our sales plans and planned profitability objectives. Other assumptions that support the carrying value of these intangible assets, including a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions which would negatively affect the cost of capital and/or discount rates, could also result in impairment of the remaining asset values. For example, as of and for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded intangible asset impairments of $26.5 million and a goodwill impairment of $17.7 million based on forecasted financial information derived from the information reasonably available to us at the time given the unknown future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded a non-cash charge of $30.8 million relative to the impairment of our Skip Hop tradename, reflecting the effect of lower sales and profitability relative to the assumptions supporting the valuation of the tradename at acquisition. Any material impairment would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have substantial debt, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business.\nAs of the end of fiscal 2021, we had $1.00 billion aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding (excluding $4.1 million of outstanding letters of credit), and $745.9 million of undrawn availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility after giving effect to $4.1 million of letters of credit issued under our senior secured revolving credit facility. As a result, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, or general corporate or other purposes may be limited, and we may be unable to renew or refinance our debt on terms as favorable as our existing debt or at all.\nIf our liquidity, cash flows, and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and other cash requirements, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nIn addition, both our senior secured revolving credit facility and, in certain circumstances, our indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive covenants that, subject to specified exemptions, restrict our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make certain investments (including business acquisitions), pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock, engage in mergers, dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions, and raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. For example, provisions in our secured revolving credit facility as amended in May 2020 have the effect of restricting our ability to pay cash dividends on, or make future repurchases of, our common stock through the date we deliver our financial statements and associated certificates relating to the third quarter of fiscal 2021, and could have the effect of restricting our ability to do so thereafter. These restrictions may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. In particular, we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient cash from operations, borrowing capacity under our debt documents, or the ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets to pursue our growth strategies as a result of these restrictions or otherwise. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to income taxes in federal and applicable state and local tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, Mexico, and other foreign jurisdictions. The taxable income in each jurisdiction is affected by certain transfer prices between affiliated entities. Challenges to the arms-length nature of these transfer prices could materially affect our taxable income in a taxing jurisdiction, and therefore affect our income tax expense. We record tax expense based on our estimates of current and future payments, which include reserves for estimates of uncertain tax positions. At any time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may impact the ultimate settlement of these tax positions. As a result, there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in any financial statement period may be materially affected by changes in the geographic mix and level of earnings.\nDuring the requisite service period for compensable equity-based compensation awards that we may grant to certain employees, we recognize a deferred income tax benefit on the compensation expense we incur for these awards for all employees other than our named executive officers. At time of subsequent vesting, exercise, or expiration of an award, the difference between our actual income tax deduction, if any, and the previously accrued income tax benefit is recognized in our income tax expense/benefit during the current period and can consequently raise or lower our effective tax rate for the period. Such differences are largely dependent on changes in the market price for our common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the United States or foreign countries upon the import or export of our products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have, if any, on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nChanges in regulatory, geopolitical, social or economic policies, treaties between the United States and other countries, and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices. For example, our taxable income may be affected by new laws, rulings, initiatives, and other events, which may affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods, including:\n\u2022the CARES Act, which was enacted in March 2020, and which significantly affects U.S. taxation by providing a retention credit and eases limitations on certain deductions including interest due to potential volatility in 2020 taxable income;\n\u2022a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, under which states may have additional ability to tax entities operating in their state, but lacking physical presence;\n\u2022mandatory country by country reporting of revenue, employees and profits, and certain international initiatives (such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\u2019s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)) that are focused on the equity of international taxation, which may ultimately result in a worldwide minimum tax, or more defined approach around global profit allocation between related companies operating in jurisdictions with disparate income tax rates; and\n\u2022tax revenue reductions as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic, which may lead to increases in state tax rates or the expansions of their tax base.\nGENERAL RISK\nQuarterly cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties, and may affect the price of our common stock.\nQuarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program have historically been part of our capital allocation strategy. Although we reinstated our share repurchase program in August 2021 and resumed payment of a quarterly dividend in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we suspended both our quarterly cash dividends and our share repurchase program due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program in the future. Decisions with respect to future dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a variety of factors, including restrictions under our secured revolving credit facility, market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. A subsequent reduction or elimination of our cash dividend, or subsequent suspension or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.", "PERMNO": 89876, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "CRI"}
