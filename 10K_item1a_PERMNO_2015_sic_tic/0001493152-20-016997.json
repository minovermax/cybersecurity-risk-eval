Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities carries a significant degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our historical financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein, before you decide to purchase our securities. Any one of these risks and uncertainties has the potential to cause material adverse effects on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results which could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements expressed by us and a significant decrease in the value of our common shares and warrants. Refer to \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nWe may not be successful in preventing the material adverse effects that any of the following risks and uncertainties may cause. These potential risks and uncertainties may not be a complete list of the risks and uncertainties facing us. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that we are presently unaware of, or presently consider immaterial, that may become material in the future and have a material adverse effect on us. You could lose all or a significant portion of your investment due to any of these risks and uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a relatively limited operating history and limited revenues to date and thus are subject to risks of business development and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nBecause we have a relatively limited operating history and limited revenues to date, you should consider and evaluate our operating prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early-stage operating companies in rapidly evolving markets. These risks include:\n\u25cf that we may not have sufficient capital to achieve our growth strategy;\n\u25cf that we may not develop our product and service offerings in a manner that enables us to be profitable and meet our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u25cf that our growth strategy may not be successful; and\n\u25cf that fluctuations in our operating results will be significant relative to our revenues.\nOur future growth will depend substantially on our ability to address these and the other risks described in this section. If we do not successfully address these risks, our business could be significantly harmed.\nWe have a history of operating losses and our management has concluded that factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our auditor has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its audit report for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTo date, we have not been profitable and have incurred significant losses and cash flow deficits. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2020 and 2019, we reported net losses of $2,620,238 and $3,565,272, respectively, and negative cash flow from operating activities of $1,522,486 and $1,395,255, respectively. As of May 31, 2020, we had an aggregate accumulated deficit of $6,195,044. We anticipate that we will continue to report losses and negative cash flow. Our management has concluded that our historical recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations as well as our dependence on private equity and financings raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our auditor has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its audit report for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOur consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. These adjustments would likely include substantial impairment of the carrying amount of our assets and potential contingent liabilities that may arise if we are unable to fulfill various operational commitments. In addition, the value of our securities, including common stock issued in this offering, would be greatly impaired. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating sufficient cash flow from operations and obtaining additional capital and financing, including funds to be raised in this offering. If our ability to generate cash flow from operations is delayed or reduced and we are unable to raise additional funding from other sources, we may be unable to continue in business even if this offering is successful. For further discussion about our ability to continue as a going concern and our plan for future liquidity, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d\nWe are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for our cash flows.\nWe are a holding company. All of our operations are conducted, and almost all of our assets are owned, by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flows and our ability to meet our obligations depend upon the cash flows of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by these subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends, distributions or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities and legal restrictions. Any failure to receive dividends or distributions from our subsidiaries when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFuture acquisitions or strategic investments could disrupt our business and harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may in the future explore potential acquisitions of companies or strategic investments to strengthen our business. Even if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms or financing of the acquisition, and our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u25cf straining our financial resources to acquire a company;\n\u25cf anticipated benefits may not materialize as rapidly as we expect, or at all;\n\u25cf diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to address acquisition integration challenges;\n\u25cf retention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u25cf cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u25cf integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u25cf litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, former stockholders or other third parties.\nFailure to appropriately mitigate these risks or other issues related to such strategic investments and acquisitions could result in reducing or completely eliminating any anticipated benefits of transactions, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may require additional funding for our growth plans, and such funding may result in a dilution of your investment.\nWe attempted to estimate our funding requirements in order to implement our growth plans. If the costs of implementing such plans should exceed these estimates significantly or if we come across opportunities to grow through expansion plans which cannot be predicted at this time, and our funds generated from our operations prove insufficient for such purposes, we may need to raise additional funds to meet these funding requirements.\nThese additional funds may be raised by issuing equity or debt securities or by borrowing from banks or other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, we will not be able to implement such plans fully if at all. Such financing even if obtained, may be accompanied by conditions that limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek lenders\u2019 consent for payment of dividends, or restrict our freedom to operate our business by requiring lender\u2019s consent for certain corporate actions.\nFurther, if we raise additional funds by way of a rights offering or through the issuance of new shares, any shareholders who are unable or unwilling to participate in such an additional round of fund raising may suffer dilution in their investment.\nWe may not have sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations, effectively pursue our strategy or sustain our growth initiatives.\nAfter the consummation of the acquisition of Simplicity Esports LLC and PLAYlive Nation, Inc., our remaining liquidity and capital resources may not be sufficient to allow us to fund our ongoing operations, effectively pursue our strategy or sustain our growth initiatives. If we require additional capital resources, we may seek such funds directly from third party sources; however, we may not be able to obtain sufficient equity capital and/or debt financing from third parties to allow us to fund our expected ongoing operations or we may not be able to obtain such equity capital or debt financing on acceptable terms or conditions. Factors affecting the availability of equity capital or debt financing to us on acceptable terms and conditions include:\n\u25cf Our current and future financial results and position;\n\u25cf the collateral availability of our otherwise unsecured assets;\n\u25cf the market\u2019s, investors and lenders\u2019 view of our industry and products;\n\u25cf the perception in the equity and debt markets of our ability to execute our business plan or achieve our operating results expectations; and\n\u25cf the price, volatility and trading volume and history of our Common Stock.\nIf we are unable to obtain the equity capital or debt financing necessary to fund our ongoing operations, pursue our strategy and sustain our growth initiatives, we may be forced to scale back our operations or our expansion initiatives, and our business and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy depends on the availability of suitable locations for our Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers and our ability to open new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers and operate them profitably.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to extend our brand by opening corporate owned as well as franchising retail Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers in locations in the United States that we believe will provide attractive returns on investment. We have identified numerous sites for potential corporate Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers and many other sites for potential franchised esports gaming centers, in the United States, however, desirable locations for additional Simplicity Esports Gaming Center openings may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new Simplicity Esports Gaming Center.\nIn addition, our ability to open new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers on a timely and cost-effective basis, or at all, is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our ability or the ability of the selected franchisee to:\n\u25cf reach acceptable agreements regarding the lease of the locations;\n\u25cf comply with applicable zoning, licensing, land use and environmental regulations;\n\u25cf raise or have available an adequate amount of cash or currently available financing for construction and opening costs;\n\u25cf timely hire, train and retain the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs;\n\u25cf obtain, for acceptable cost, required permits and approvals, including liquor licenses; and\n\u25cf efficiently manage the amount of time and money used to build and open each new Simplicity Esports Gaming Center.\nIf we succeed in opening new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers on a timely and cost-effective basis, we may nonetheless be unable to attract enough customers to the new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers because potential customers may be unfamiliar with our brands or concepts, or our entertainment and menu options might not appeal to them. Our new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers may not meet or exceed our performance targets, including target cash-on-cash returns. New Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers may even operate at a loss, which could have a significant adverse effect on our overall operating results.\nOur operations of Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers are significantly dependent on changes in public and customer tastes and discretionary spending patterns. Our inability to successfully anticipate customer preferences or to gain popularity for such Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers games may negatively impact our profitability.\nOur success depends significantly on public and customer tastes and preferences, which can be unpredictable. If we are unable to successfully anticipate customer preferences or increase the popularity of the games offered at the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers, the per capita revenue and overall customer expenditures at the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers may decrease, and thereby negatively impact our profitability. In response to such developments, we may need to increase our marketing and product development efforts and expenditures, adjust our game or product sale pricing, modify the games themselves, or take other actions, which may further erode our profit margins, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, we may need to expend considerable cost and effort in carrying out extensive research and development to assess the potential interest in a game, testing and launching new games, and to remain abreast with continually evolving technology and trends, as well as the success and popularity of Simplicity stream team\u2019s casters, influencers and personalities among Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s dedicated fan base.\nWhile we may incur significant expenditures of this nature, including in the future as we continue to expand our operations, there can be no assurance that any such expenditures or investments by us will yield expected or commensurate returns or results, within a reasonable or anticipated time, or at all.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to negative publicity or customer complaints, including in relation to, among other things, accidents, injuries or thefts at the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers, or health and safety concerns arising from improper use of our game equipment or at our food and beverage venues.\nOur business inherently exposes us to negative publicity or customer complaints as a result of accidents, injuries, or in extreme cases, deaths, arising from instances of air-borne, water-borne or food-borne contagion or illness, food contamination, spoilage, tampering, equipment failure, improper use of our equipment, fire, explosion, terrorist attacks or civil riots, and other safety or security issues, such as kidnapping, or associated risks arising from other actual or perceived non-compliance with safety, quality or service standards or norms in relation to the various game, entertainment and food and beverage attractions at the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers. Even isolated or sporadic incidents or accidents may have a negative impact on our brand image and reputation, and the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers\u2019, or games\u2019 or our own popularity with customers. The considerable expansion of social media in recent years has compounded the effect of any potential negative publicity.\nWe cannot guarantee that our or our franchisee\u2019s employee training, internal controls and other precautions will be sufficient to prevent any such occurrence at the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers, in relation to our Simplicity global virtual reality gaming and fully integrated esports platform, or to control or mitigate any negative consequences. In addition, we or our franchisees rely on third-party security and housekeeping staff for certain non-core functions, as well as certain technology vendors and partners. Although we monitor vendors and partners and, in certain cases, may have a contractual indemnity or recourse in case of any default on their part, our ability to assure a safe and satisfactory experience to our customers is necessarily limited to the extent of our or our franchisees\u2019, dependence on third parties, from time to time. Moreover, we may not be able to distance or insulate ourselves from any adverse publicity or reputational damage arising from any act, omission or negligence on the part of a vendor or other third party, which may negatively affect a customer\u2019s experience at any of the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers.\nWe or our franchisees may not be able to operate in the United States, or obtain and maintain licenses and permits necessary for such operation, in compliance with laws, regulations and other requirements, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nEach Simplicity Esports Gaming Center will be subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, amusement, health, sanitation, safety, building code and fire agencies in the country, state, county and/or municipality in which the Simplicity Esports Gaming Center is located. In the United States, each Simplicity Esports Gaming Center with a restaurant or bar will be required to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises from a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. In some states, the loss of a license for cause with respect to one Simplicity Esports Gaming Center may lead to the loss of licenses at all Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers in that state and could make it more difficult to obtain additional licenses in that state. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of each Simplicity Esports Gaming Center, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. Our failure or a failure by a franchisee in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses, permits and approvals at any one Simplicity Esports Gaming Center could impact the continuing operations of existing Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers, or delay or prevent the opening of new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers. Although we do not anticipate any material difficulties occurring in the future, the failure to receive or retain a liquor license, or any other required permit or license, in a particular location, or to continue to qualify for, or renew licenses, could have a material adverse effect on operations and our ability to obtain such a license or permit in other locations.\nAs a result of operating certain entertainment games and attractions, including skill-based games that offer redemption prizes, the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers in the United States are subject to amusement licensing and regulation by the countries, states, provinces, counties and municipalities in which our Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers are located. These laws and regulations can vary significantly by country, state, province, county, and municipality and, in some jurisdictions, may require us to modify our business operations or alter the mix of redemption games and simulators we offer. Moreover, as more states in the United States and local communities implement legalized gambling, the laws and corresponding enabling regulations may also be applicable to our redemption games and regulators may create new licensing requirements, taxes or fees, or restrictions on the various types of redemption games we offer. Furthermore, other states, provinces, counties and municipalities may make changes to existing laws to further regulate legalized gaming and illegal gambling. Adoption of these laws, or adverse interpretation of existing laws, after we have established a Simplicity Esports Gaming Center in the jurisdiction could require the existing center in these jurisdictions to alter the mix of games, modify certain games, change the mix of prizes that we may offer or terminate the use of specific games, any of which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including those related to minimum wage requirements, exempt status, overtime, health insurance mandates, working and safety conditions, immigration status requirements, child labor, and non-discrimination. Additionally, changes in federal labor laws, including card verification regulations, could result in portions of our workforce being subjected to greater organized labor influence, which could result in an increase to our labor costs. A significant portion of Simplicity Esports Gaming Center personnel will be paid at minimum wage rates established by federal, state and municipal law. Increases in the minimum wage result in higher labor costs, which may be only partially offset by price increases and operational efficiencies.\nWe are also subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The Federal Trade Commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees, and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities. State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply. We shall endeavor to make sure that any franchise disclosure document we provide, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures, comply in all material respects with both the Federal Trade Commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises.\nIf we and our franchisees fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we may be subject to various sanctions and/or penalties and fines or may be required to cease operations until we achieve compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial results.\nOur growth through franchising may not occur as rapidly as we currently anticipate and may be subject to additional risks.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we will continue to seek franchisees to operate Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers in certain strategic domestic locations or venues. We believe that our ability to recruit, retain and contract with qualified franchisees will be increasingly important to our operations as we expand. Our franchisees are dependent upon the availability of adequate sources of financing in order to meet their development obligations. Such financing may not be available to our franchisees, or only available upon disadvantageous terms. Our franchise strategy may not enhance our results of operations.\nExpanding through franchising exposes our business and brand to risks because the quality of the franchised operations will be beyond our immediate control, including risks associated with our confidential information, intellectual properties (including trademarks) and brand reputation. Even if we have contractual remedies to cause franchisees to maintain operational standards, enforcing those remedies may require litigation and therefore our image and reputation may suffer, unless and until such litigation is successfully concluded.\nWe could face liability from or as a result of our franchisees.\nVarious state and federal laws will govern the relationship between us and our franchisees and the potential sale of a franchise. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be liable for damages to franchisees and fines or other penalties. A franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationship. Also, under the franchise business model, we may face claims and liabilities based on vicarious liability, joint-employer liability, or other theories or liabilities. Such legal actions could result in expensive litigation with our franchisees or government agencies that could adversely affect both our profit and our important relations with our franchisees. In addition, regulatory or legal developments could result in changes to laws or the franchisor/franchisee relationship that could negatively impact the franchise business model and, accordingly, our profit.\nWe may not be able to compete favorably in the highly competitive out-of-home and home-based entertainment market in the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe out-of-home entertainment market in the United States is highly competitive. Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers that we or our franchisees operate will compete for customers\u2019 discretionary entertainment dollars with providers of out-of-home entertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theatres, sporting events, bowling alleys, sports activity centers, arcades and entertainment centers, nightclubs and restaurants as well as theme parks. Many of the entities operating these businesses are larger and have significantly greater financial resources, a greater number of locations, have been in business longer, have greater name and brand recognition and are better established in the local markets where Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers are planned to be located. As a result, they may be able to invest greater resources than we can in attracting customers and succeed in attracting customers who would otherwise come to the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers we or our franchisees operate. In the United States, the legalization of casino gambling in geographic areas near any future Simplicity Esports Gaming Center would create the possibility for adult entertainment alternatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We will also face competition from local, regional and national establishments that offer entertainment experiences similar to us. Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers we or our franchisees operate will also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based forms of entertainment, such as internet and video gaming and home movie streaming and delivery. If we fail to compete favorably in the competitive out-of-home and home-based entertainment markets it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur senior management team has limited experience in establishing, operating, licensing rights to and franchising entertainment centers and related products.\nThe members of our senior management team have extensive backgrounds in finance and the management of financial services businesses, however, they have limited prior experience in establishing, operating, licensing rights to and franchising entertainment centers. We will need to expand our management team, to include individuals with expertise in establishing and operating entertainment centers as well as individuals with expertise in product licensing and franchise operations. If we are unable to recruit professionals with acceptable backgrounds in establishing and operating entertainment centers and with backgrounds in product licensing and financing, we may not be able to pursue our growth strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified management and operating personnel at Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers.\nWe and our franchisees must attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified management and operating personnel in order to maintain consistency in our service, hospitality, quality and atmosphere of our Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers. Qualified management and operating personnel are typically in high demand. If we and our franchisees are unable to attract and retain a satisfactory number of qualified management and operating personnel, labor shortages could delay the planned openings of new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions, other strategic alliances and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or product has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks may include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges;\n\u25cf failure to successfully further develop the acquired business or product lines;\n\u25cf implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;\n\u25cf integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resources and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions;\n\u25cf transition of operations, users and customers onto our existing platforms;\n\u25cf reliance on the expertise of our strategic partners with respect to market development, sales, local regulatory compliance and other operational matters;\n\u25cf failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval, under competition and antitrust laws which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition;\n\u25cf in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u25cf cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire;\n\u25cf liability for or reputational harm from activities of the acquired company before the acquisition or from our strategic partners, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u25cf litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former shareholders or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments or strategic alliances could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, investments or alliances, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nOur acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows. Also, the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.\nOur insurance coverage may not adequately protect us against all future risks, which may adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe maintain insurance coverage, including for fire, acts of god and perils, terrorism, burglary, money, loss of profit, fidelity guarantee, fixed glass and sanitary fitting, electronic equipment, machinery breakdown, portable equipment, sign boards, commercial general liability, marine transit, and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, as well as employee health and medical insurance, with standard exclusions in each instance. While we maintain insurance in amounts that we consider reasonably sufficient for a business of our nature and scale, with insurers that we consider reliable and credit worthy, we may face losses and liabilities that are uninsurable by their nature, or that are not covered, fully or at all, under our existing insurance policies. Moreover, coverage under such insurance policies would generally be subject to certain standard or negotiated exclusions or qualifications and, therefore, any future insurance claims by us may not be honored by our insurers in full, or at all. In addition, our premium payments under our insurance policies may require a significant investment by us.\nTo the extent that we suffer loss or damage that is not covered by insurance or that exceeds our insurance coverage, the loss will have to be borne by us and our business, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their departure could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and directors. We do not have key-man insurance on the life of any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us.\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. While our employment agreements with our key executive officers contain non-compete provisions, we do not have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any November 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following May 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may require substantial financial and management resources.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls. As long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting.\nProvisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Common Stock and could entrench management.\nOur third amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nIf we fail to keep pace with changing industry technology and consumer preferences, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe Simplicity products and services compete within industries that are characterized by swiftly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new and enhanced product introductions, rapidly changing consumer preferences and product obsolescence. In order to continue to compete effectively, we need to respond quickly to technological changes and to understand their impact on customers\u2019 preferences. We may take significant time and resources to respond to these technological changes and changes in consumer preferences. Our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted if our products and services fail to keep pace with these changes.\nVarious product safety laws and governmental regulations applicable to the distributor of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s and/or PLAYlive Nation, Inc.\u2019s products may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur distribution of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s and/or PLAYlive Nation, Inc.\u2019s products will be subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to product safety, including regulations enforced by the United States Consumer Products Safety Commission. We and our franchisees could incur costs in complying with these regulations and, if they fail to comply, could incur significant penalties. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or concerns about product safety, may also lead to a recall or post-manufacture repair of selected Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s and/or PLAYlive Nation, Inc.\u2019s products, resulting in the rejection of the products by our franchisees, lost sales, increased customer service and support costs, and costly litigation.\nPublic health epidemics or outbreaks, such as COVID-19, could materially and adversely impact our business.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally.\nBecause COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the United States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Additional, more restrictive proclamations and/or directives may be issued in the future. As a result, all of our corporate and franchised Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers were closed effective April 1, 2020. We commenced reopening Simplicity Gaming Centers on May 1, 2020 and have since reopened one corporate and 21 franchised Simplicity Gaming Centers as of June 28, 2020. Although our franchise agreements with franchisees of Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers require a minimum monthly royalty payment to us from the franchisees regardless of whether the franchised Simplicity Gaming Centers are operating, there is a potential risk that franchisees of Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers will default in their obligations to pay their minimum monthly royalty payment to us.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe measures taken to date will impact the Company\u2019s business for the fiscal fourth quarter and potentially beyond. Management expects that all of its business segments, across all of its geographies, will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company\u2019s business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.\nRisks Relating to Our Esports Business\nOur esports businesses are substantially dependent on the continuing popularity of the esports industry as a whole.\nThe esports industry is in the early stages of its respective development. Although the esports industry has experienced rapid growth, consumer preferences may shift and there is no assurance this growth will continue in the future. We have taken steps to diversify their businesses and mitigate these risks to an extent and continue to seek out new opportunities in the esports industry. However, due to the rapidly evolving nature of technology and online gaming, the esports industry may experience volatile and declining popularity as new options for online gaming and esports become available, or consumer preferences shift to other forms of entertainment, and as a consequence, our businesses and results of operations may be materially negatively affected.\nOur esports business faces intense and wide-ranging competition, which may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe success of our esports business is dependent upon the performance and/or popularity of its teams. Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s teams compete, in varying respects and degrees, with other live sporting events, and with sporting events delivered over television networks, radio, the Internet and online services, mobile applications and other alternative sources. For example, our esports teams compete for attendance, viewership and advertising with a wide range of alternatives available in major metropolitan areas. During some or all of the esports season, our teams face competition, in varying respects and degrees, from professional and collegiate basketball, hockey, baseball, football, and soccer, among others.\nAs a result of the large number of options available, we face strong competition for the sports and gaming fan. We must compete with other esports teams, traditional sports teams and sporting events, in varying respects and degrees, including on the basis of the quality of the teams we field, their success in the leagues, tournaments and genres in which they compete, our ability to provide an entertaining environment at any esports games that we host at our centers, prices charged for tickets and the viewing availability of our teams on multiple media alternatives. Given the nature of esports and sports in general, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, including with companies that may have greater resources than we have, and as a consequence, our business and results of operations may be materially negatively affected by competition.\nOur businesses are substantially dependent on the continued popularity and/or competitive success of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s teams, which cannot be assured.\nOur future financial results will be dependent on the Simplicity teams becoming and remaining popular with our fan base and, in varying degrees, on the teams achieving in-game success, which can generate fan enthusiasm, resulting in sustained ticket and merchandise sales during the season. Furthermore, success in the regular season at certain tournaments may qualify one or more of our esports teams for participation in post-season playoffs, which provides us with additional revenue from prize money by increasing the number of games played by our sports teams and, more importantly, by generating increased excitement and interest in our esports teams, which can improve attendance in subsequent seasons. There can be no assurance that any of our esports teams, will develop a significant fan base, maintain continued popularity or compete in post-season play in the future.\nDefection of our esports players to other teams or managers could hinder our success.\nWe compete with other esports athlete management businesses to sign and retain world class esports players, some of which have greater resources or brand recognition and popularity than ours. Our players may choose to defect to other esports organizations for various reasons, including that they have been made a superior offer or they have chosen to pursue new or other opportunities. The loss or defection of any of our esports players could have negative consequences on our businesses and results of operations. While we take or intend to take, all appropriate steps to retain our players and protect their interests, there can be no assurances that players will not defect to other esports organizations.\nThe actions of the various esports leagues and tournaments may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe governing bodies of the various esports leagues and tournaments, under certain circumstances, can take actions that they deem to be in the best interests of their respective leagues or tournaments, which may not necessarily be consistent with maximizing our results of operations and which could affect our esports teams in ways that are different than the impact on other esports teams. For example they can take actions relating to the rights to telecast the games of league members or tournament participants, including the Simplicity team, licensing of the rights to produce and sell merchandise bearing the logos and/or other intellectual property of our esports teams and the leagues or tournaments, and the internet-based activities of our esports teams. Certain of these decisions by the esports leagues and tournaments could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. From time to time, we may disagree with or challenge actions that the leagues or tournaments take or the power and authority they assert.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage the growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including our expansion into the esports business which is untested and into adjacent business opportunities.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage our expanded business, including our aspirations for continued expansion. We intend to dedicate resources to a new business model that is largely untested, as is the case with esports. We do not know to what extent our future expansions will be successful. Further, even if successful, the growth of our business could create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, and could increase existing strain on, and divert focus from, our core businesses. If not managed effectively, this growth could result in the over-extension of our operating infrastructure, and our management systems, information technology systems, and internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support this growth. Failure to adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may cause damage to our brand, damage our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources among, emerging technologies and business models, our business may be negatively impacted.\nTechnology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry. We must continually anticipate and adapt our products, services and business models to emerging technologies and delivery platforms in order to stay competitive. Forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new products, services and business models is inherently uncertain and volatile, and if we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products or services incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve significant commercial success, whether because of competition or otherwise, we may not recover the often substantial \u201cup front\u201d costs of developing and marketing those products and services, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or services. Further, our competitors may adapt to an emerging technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to ours, more appealing to consumers, or both.\nIf, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products or services incorporating a new technology or for new platforms, or otherwise elect not to pursue new business models, that achieve significant commercial success, it may have adverse consequences. It may take significant time and resources to shift product development resources to that technology, platform or business model, as the case may be, and may be more difficult to compete against existing products and services incorporating that technology or for that platform or against companies using that business model.\nMany elements of our business are unique, evolving and relatively unproven. Our business and prospects depend on the continuing development of live streaming of competitive esports gaming. The market for esports and amateur online gaming competition is relatively new and rapidly developing and are subject to significant challenges. Our business relies upon our ability to cultivate and grow an active gamer community, and our ability to successfully monetize such community through tournament fees, subscriptions for our esports gaming services, and advertising and sponsorship opportunities. In addition, our continued growth depends, in part, on our ability to respond to constant changes in the esports gaming industry, including rapid technological evolution, continued shifts in gamer trends and demands, frequent introductions of new games and titles and the constant emergence of new industry standards and practices. Developing and integrating new games, titles, content, products, services or infrastructure could be expensive and time-consuming, and these efforts may not yield the benefits we expect to achieve at all. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in any of these aspects or that the esports gaming industry will continue to grow as rapidly as it has in the past.\nWe may encounter difficulties in integrating Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s esports businesses or otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time, we acquire, make investments in, or enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with, complementary businesses, such as the acquisition of the Simplicity esports business in January 2019. The acquisition of Simplicity Esports LLC involves significant risks and uncertainties, including: (i) the potential for Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s business to underperform relative to our expectations and the acquisition price, (ii) the potential for Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s business to cause our financial results to differ from expectations in any given period, or over the longer-term, (iii) unexpected tax consequences from the acquisition, or the tax treatment of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s business\u2019s operations going forward, giving rise to incremental tax liabilities that are difficult to predict, (iv) difficulty in integrating Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s business, its operations and its employees in an efficient and effective manner, (v) any unknown liabilities or internal control deficiencies assumed as part of the acquisition, and (vi) the potential loss of key employees of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s businesses. Further, the transaction may involve the risk that our senior management\u2019s attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations, the risk that the gaming industry does not evolve as anticipated and that any intellectual property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those needed for our future success, and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved.\nOur business may be harmed if our licensing partners, or other third parties with whom we do business, act in ways that put our brand at risk.\nWe anticipate that our business partners shall be given access to sensitive and proprietary information or control over our intellectual property in order to provide services and support to our teams. These third parties may misappropriate our information or intellectual property and engage in unauthorized use of it or otherwise act in a way that places our brand at risk. The failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, the failure of third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies or the misappropriation or misuse of this information or intellectual property could result in a disruption to our business operations or an adverse effect on our reputation, and may negatively impact our business.\nOur business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game platforms manufactured by third parties.\nWe expect to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from esports games played on game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Sony\u2019s PS4\u00ae, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One\u00ae, and Nintendo\u2019s Wii U\u00ae and Switch\u00ae, and PCs. The success of our business will be driven in large part by our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace. We also rely on the availability of an adequate supply of these video game consoles and the continued support for these consoles by their manufacturers. We may be required to commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform. If increased costs are not offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, our business could be negatively impacted. If the platforms for which we invested resources do not attain significant market acceptance, we may not be able to recover our costs, which could be significant.\nThe games we support are subject to scrutiny regarding the appropriateness of their content. If the publishers and distributors we partner with fail to receive their target ratings for certain titles, or if retailers refuse to sell such titles due to what they perceive to be objectionable content, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nConsole and PC games are subject to ratings by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (the \u201cESRB\u201d), a self-regulatory body based in the U.S. that provides U.S. and Canadian consumers of interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in such software, such as violence, nudity or sexual content, along with an assessment of the suitability of the content for certain age groups. Certain other countries have also established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In addition, certain stores use other ratings systems, such as Apple\u2019s use of its proprietary \u201cApp Rating System\u201d and Google Play\u2019s use of the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) rating system. If the software publishers that supply our games are unable to obtain the ratings they have targeted for their products, it could have a negative impact on our business. In some instances, the software publishers and developers may be required to modify their products to comply with the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories, which would limited its availability for use in the games that our teams play.\nWe will depend on servers to operate our games with online features. If we were to lose server functionality for any reason, our business may be negatively impacted.\nOur business at our game centers will rely on the continuous operation of servers, some of which are owned and operated by third parties. Although we shall strive to maintain more than sufficient server capacity, and provide for active redundancy in the event of limited hardware failure, any broad-based catastrophic server malfunction, a significant service-disrupting attack or intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures, a failure of disaster recovery service or the failure of a company on which we are relying for server capacity to provide that capacity for whatever reason would likely degrade or interrupt the functionality of our games with online features, and could prevent the operation of such games altogether, any of which could result in the loss of sales for, or in, such games.\nWe also rely on networks operated by third parties, such as the PlayStation\u00ae Network, Xbox Live\u00ae and Steam\u00ae, for the functionality of the games we use which have online features. An extended interruption to any of these services could adversely affect our ability to operate our games with online features, negatively impacting our business.\nFurther, insufficient server capacity could also negatively impact our game center business. Conversely, if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business, we may incur unnecessary additional operating costs.\nThe esports gaming industry is very \u201chit\u201d driven. We may not have access to \u201chit\u201d games or titles.\nSelect game titles dominate competitive esports and online gaming, including League of Legends, Minecraft, Fortnite and Overwatch, and many new games titles are regularly introduced in each major industry segment (console, mobile and PC free-to-download). Despite the number of new entrants, only a very few \u201chit\u201d titles account for a significant portion of total revenue in each segment.\nThe size and engagement level of our online and in person gamers are critical to our success and are closely linked to the quality and popularity of the esports game publishers with which we have licenses. Esports game publishers on our gaming platform, including those who have entered into license agreements with us, may leave us for other gaming platforms or leagues which may offer better competition, and terms and conditions than we do. Furthermore, we may lose esports game publishers if we fail to generate the number of gamers to our tournaments and league competitions expected by such publishers. In addition, if popular esports game publishers cease to license their games to us, or our live streams fail to attract gamers, we may experience a decline in gamer traffic, subscriptions and engagement, which may have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe must continue to attract and retain the most popular esports gaming titles in order to maintain and increase the popularity of our leagues, tournaments and competitions, and ensure the sustainable growth of our gamer community. We must continue to identify and enter into license agreements with esports gaming publishers developing \u201chit\u2019 games that resonate with our community on an ongoing basis. We cannot assure you that we can continue to attract and retain the same level of first-tier esports game publishers and our ability to do so is critical to our future success.\nIf we fail to keep our existing gamers highly engaged, to acquire new gamers, to successfully implement a membership model for our gaming community, our business, profitability and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the number of gamers attending and participating in our in-person and online tournaments and competitions, and using our gaming platform, and keeping our gamers highly engaged. Of particular importance is the successful deployment and expansion of our membership model to our gaming community for purposes of creating predictable recurring revenues.\nIn order to attract, retain and engage gamers and remain competitive, we must continue to develop and expand our leagues, including internationally, produce engaging tournaments and competitions, successfully license the newest \u201chit\u201d esports games and titles, implement new technologies and strategies, improve features of our gaming platform and stimulate interactions in our gamer community.\nA decline in the number of our gamers in our ecosystem may adversely affect the engagement level of our gamers, the vibrancy of our gamer community, or the popularity of our league play, which may in turn reduce our monetization opportunities, and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to attract and retain gamers, our revenues may decline and our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nWe cannot assure you that our online and in person gaming platform and centers will remain sufficiently popular with gamers to offset the costs incurred to operate and expand them. It is vital to our operations that we remain sensitive and responsive to evolving gamer preferences and offer first-tier esports game content that attracts our gamers. We must also keep providing gamers with new features and functions to enable superior content viewing, and social interaction. Further, we will need to continue to develop and improve our gaming platform and centers and to enhance our brand awareness, which may require us to incur substantial costs and expenses. If such increased costs and expenses do not effectively translate into an improved gamer experience and long-term engagement, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nThe risks related to international operations, in particular in countries outside of the United States, could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results.\nIt is expected that the Company will derive between 15% to 20% of its revenue from transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, such as Brazil, and the Company expects that receivables with respect to foreign sales will account for a significant amount of its total accounts and receivables. As such, the Company\u2019s operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign government policies and legislation or social instability and other factors which are not within the control of the Company, including, but not limited to, recessions in foreign economies, expropriation, nationalization and limitation or restriction on repatriation of funds, assets or earnings, longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, changes in consumer tastes and trends, renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts or licenses, changes in gaming policies, regulatory requirements or the personnel administering them, currency fluctuations and devaluations, exchange controls, economic sanctions and royalty and tax increases, risk of terrorist activities, revolution, border disputes, implementation of tariffs and other trade barriers and protectionist practices, taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, volatility of financial markets and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, difficulties in the protection of intellectual property particularly in countries with fewer intellectual property protections, the effects that evolving regulations regarding data privacy may have on the Company\u2019s online operations, adverse changes in the creditworthiness of parties with whom the Company has significant receivables or forward currency exchange contracts, labor disputes and other risks arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over the areas in which the Company\u2019s operations are conducted. The Company\u2019s operations may also be adversely affected by social, political and economic instability and by laws and policies of such foreign jurisdictions affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment. If the Company\u2019s operations are disrupted and/or the economic integrity of its contracts is threatened for unexpected reasons, its business may be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s international activities may require protracted negotiations with host governments, national companies and third parties. Foreign government regulations may favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. In the event of a dispute arising in connection with the Company\u2019s operations in a foreign jurisdiction where it conducts its business, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdictions of the courts of United States or enforcing American judgments in such other jurisdictions. The Company may also be hindered or prevented from enforcing its rights with respect to a governmental instrumentality because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s activities in foreign jurisdictions could be substantially affected by factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on it. The Company believes that management\u2019s experience to date in commercializing its products, services and solutions in Brazil may be of assistance in helping to reduce these risks. Some countries in which the Company may operate may be considered politically and economically unstable.\nDoing business in the industries in which the Company operates often requires compliance with numerous and extensive procedures and formalities. These procedures and formalities may result in unexpected or lengthy delays in commencing important business activities. In some cases, failure to follow such formalities or obtain relevant evidence may call into question the validity of the entity or the actions taken. Management of the Company is unable to predict the effect of additional corporate and regulatory formalities which may be adopted in the future including whether any such laws or regulations would materially increase the Company\u2019s cost of doing business or affect its operations in any area.\nThe Company may in the future enter into agreements and conduct activities outside of the jurisdictions where it currently carries on business, which expansion may present challenges and risks that the Company has not faced in the past, any of which could adversely affect the results of operations and/or financial condition of the Company.\nThe Company is subject to foreign exchange and currency risks that could adversely affect its operations, and the Company\u2019s ability to mitigate its foreign exchange risk through hedging transactions may be limited.\nThe Company expects that it will derive between 15% and 20% of its revenues in currencies other than the United States dollar; however, a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s operating expenses are incurred in United States dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar, the Real (Brazil) and other currencies may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. The Company\u2019s consolidated financial results are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate exposures arise from current transactions and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than United States dollars and from the translation of foreign-currency-denominated balance sheet accounts into United States dollar-denominated balance sheet accounts. The Company is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because portions of its revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, particularly the Real. In particular, uncertainty regarding economic conditions in Brazil pose risk to the stability of the Real. Exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results and cash flows and the value of its assets outside of United States. If a foreign currency is devalued in a jurisdiction in which the Company is paid in such currency, then the Company\u2019s customers may be required to pay higher amounts for the Company\u2019s products or services, which they may be unable or unwilling to pay.\nWhile the Company may enter into forward currency swaps and other derivative instruments intended to mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk, there can be no assurance the Company will do so or that any instruments that the Company enters into will successfully mitigate such risk. If the Company enters into foreign currency forward or other hedging contracts, the Company would be subject to the risk that a counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults on its performance under the contracts. During an economic downturn, a counterparty\u2019s financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and with little notice, and the Company may be unable to take action to protect its exposure. In the event of a counterparty default, the Company could lose the benefit of its hedging contract, which may harm its business and financial condition. In the event that one or more of the Company\u2019s counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, its ability to eventually recover any benefit lost as a result of that counterparty\u2019s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty. The Company expects that it will not be able to hedge all of its exposure to any particular foreign currency, and it may not hedge its exposure at all with respect to certain foreign currencies. Changes in exchange rates and the Company\u2019s limited ability or inability to successfully hedge exchange rate risk could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain licenses in new jurisdictions where our customers operate.\nWe are subject to regulation in any jurisdiction where our customers access our website. To expand into any such jurisdiction, we may need to be licensed, or obtain approvals of our products or services. If we do not receive, or receive a revocation of a license in a particular jurisdiction for our products or services, we would not be able to sell or place our products or services in that jurisdiction. Any such outcome could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and any growth plans for our business.\nPrivacy concerns could result in regulatory changes and impose additional costs and liabilities on the Company, limit its use of information, and adversely affect its business.\nPersonal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States, Brazil, Europe, and many other countries in which the Company currently operates and may operate in the future. Many federal, state, and foreign legislatures and government agencies have imposed or are considering imposing restrictions and requirements about the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information obtained from individuals. Changes to laws or regulations affecting privacy could impose additional costs and liability on the Company and could limit its use of such information to add value for customers. If the Company were required to change its business activities or revise or eliminate services, or to implement burdensome compliance measures, its business and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, the Company may be subject to fines, penalties, and potential litigation if it fails to comply with applicable privacy regulations, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, liquidity and results of operation.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which it operates or where its customers or suppliers operate.\nThe Company, its customers, and its suppliers have operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and other geological events, including hurricanes, earthquakes, or flood that could disrupt operations. Any serious disruption at any of the Company\u2019s facilities or the facilities of its customers or suppliers due to a natural disaster could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenues and increase its costs and expenses. If there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of the Company\u2019s facilities, it could impair its ability to adequately supply its customers, cause a significant disruption to its operations, cause the Company to incur significant costs to relocate or re-establish these functions and negatively impact its operating results. While the Company intends to seek insurance against certain business interruption risks, such insurance may not adequately compensate the Company for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. In addition, any natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to the operations of the Company\u2019s customers or suppliers may adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nThe Company is subject to various laws relating to trade, export controls, and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect its operations, reputation, business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions. Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our business. Changes in trade sanctions laws may restrict the Company\u2019s business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers or its employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, prohibitions on the conduct of its business and its inability to market and sell the Company\u2019s products or services in one or more countries. Additionally, any such violations could materially damage the Company\u2019s reputation, brand, international expansion efforts, ability to attract and retain employees and the Company\u2019s business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nRegulations that may be adopted with respect to the internet and electronic commerce may decrease the growth in the use of the internet and lead to the decrease in the demand for Esports\u2019 products and services.\nThe Company may become subject to any number of laws and regulations that may be adopted with respect to the internet and electronic commerce. New laws and regulations that address issues such as user privacy, pricing, online content regulation, taxation, advertising, intellectual property, information security, and the characteristics and quality of online products and services may be enacted. As well, current laws, which predate or are incompatible with the internet and electronic commerce, may be applied and enforced in a manner that restricts the electronic commerce market. The application of such pre-existing laws regulating communications or commerce in the context of the internet and electronic commerce is uncertain. Moreover, it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement, libel and personal privacy are applicable to the internet. The adoption of new laws or regulations relating to the internet, or particular applications or interpretations of existing laws, could decrease the growth in the use of the internet, decrease the demand for esports\u2019 products and services, increase esports\u2019 cost of doing business or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on esports\u2019 business, revenues, operating results and financial condition.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Securities and Capital Structure\nWe have not paid dividends on our Common Stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the future. Any return on investment in our common stock may be limited to the value of our Common Stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our Common Stock would depend on earnings, financial condition, and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends on our Common Stock, our Common Stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates.\nTrading on the OTC Markets is volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our security holders to resell their common stock and/or warrants.\nOur Common Stock and Public Warrants are quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. (\u201cOTC Markets\u201d). Trading in securities quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors, some of which may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Markets is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like Nasdaq or a stock exchange like the NYSE American. These factors may result in investors having difficulty reselling any shares of our common stock.\nOur stock price is likely to be highly volatile because of several factors, including a limited public float.\nThe market price of our Common Stock and Public Warrants have been volatile in the past and the market price of our Common Stock and Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants are likely to be highly volatile in the future. You may not be able to resell shares of our Common Stock and/or Private Placement Warrants following periods of volatility because of the market\u2019s adverse reaction to volatility.\nOther factors that could cause such volatility may include, among other things:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf we may have a low trading volume for a number of reasons, including that a large portion of our stock is closely held;\n\u25cf overall stock market fluctuations;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf actual or perceived limitations on our ability to raise capital when we require it, and to raise such capital on favorable terms;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in the industry;\n\u25cf litigation;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of other similar companies;\n\u25cf future sales of common stock;\n\u25cf departure of key personnel or failure to hire key personnel; and\n\u25cf general market conditions.\nAny of these factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our Common Stock and/or Private Placement Warrants. In addition, the stock market in general has at times experienced extreme volatility and rapid decline that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock and/or Private Placement Warrants, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our securities adversely, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on the Company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, our stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover the Company change their recommendation regarding our securities adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our securities would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover the Company were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on it, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur common stock has in the past been a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC rules, and our warrants may be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. It may be more difficult to resell securities classified as \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nIn the past, our common stock was a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under applicable SEC rules (generally defined as non-exchange traded stock with a per-share price below $5.00). Unless we successfully list our common stock and our warrants on a national stock exchange, or maintain a per-share price above $5.00, these rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as \u201cestablished customers\u201d or \u201caccredited investors.\u201d For example, broker-dealers must determine the appropriateness for non-qualifying persons of investments in penny stocks. Broker-dealers must also provide, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, disclose the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, furnish monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account, provide a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction.\nLegal remedies available to an investor in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d may include the following:\n\u25cf If a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is sold to the investor in violation of the requirements listed above, or other federal or states securities laws, the investor may be able to cancel the purchase and receive a refund of the investment.\n\u25cf If a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is sold to the investor in a fraudulent manner, the investor may be able to sue the persons and firms that committed the fraud for damages.\nHowever, investors who have signed arbitration agreements may have to pursue their claims through arbitration.\nThese requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock or our Private Placement Warrants and may affect your ability to resell our common stock and our Private Placement Warrants.\nMany brokerage firms will discourage or refrain from recommending investments in penny stocks. Most institutional investors will not invest in penny stocks. In addition, many individual investors will not invest in penny stocks due, among other reasons, to the increased financial risk generally associated with these investments.\nFor these reasons, penny stocks may have a limited market and, consequently, limited liquidity. We can give no assurance at what time, if ever, our common stock or our Private Placement Warrants will not be classified as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d in the future.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may cause the price of the Common Stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, the market price of our Common Stock could fall. These sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell our equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. This risk is significant because of concentrated positions of our Common Stock held by a small group of investors.\nBecause certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our Common Stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring stockholder approval.\nOur directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 21.7% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. Accordingly, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, will have significant influence on the ability to control the Company and the outcome of issues submitted to our stockholders.\nIf the benefits of any proposed acquisition of do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of our Common Stock may decline.\nIf the benefits of any proposed acquisition of do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our Common Stock prior to the closing of the proposed acquisition may decline. The market values of our Common Stock at the time of the proposed acquisition may vary significantly from their prices on the date the acquisition target was identified.\nIn addition, broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our Common Stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance, or their interpretation, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to our previously filed financial statements, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a significant effect on our reported results and retroactively affect previously reported results.\nBeing a public company results in additional expenses, diverts management\u2019s attention and could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified directors.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These requirements generate significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on our personnel and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to establish the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight are required.\nAs a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have an adverse and even material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. If we are unable to obtain appropriate director and officer insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors, especially those directors who may be deemed independent, could be adversely impacted.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable to those of some other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.\nAs a public reporting company with less than $1,070,000,000 in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an emerging growth company we:\n\u25cf are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u25cf are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as \u201ccompensation discussion and analysis\u201d);\n\u25cf are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden-parachute\u201d votes);\n\u25cf are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure;\n\u25cf may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d); and\n\u25cf are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act.\nCertain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or Chief Executive Officer pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d if we have more than $1,070,000,000 in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Further, under current SEC rules we will continue to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive due to our reliance on these exemptions.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. However, as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the end of the fiscal year for which our second annual report is due or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have undertaken various actions, and may need to take additional actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal control can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. Additionally, when evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. If we identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting once we are no longer an emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u25cf limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u25cf controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf providing that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by stockholders only for cause; and\n\u25cf advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in our board of directors and management.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our security holders to receive a premium for their securities and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our securities.\nIn the event that our common stock price does not exceed the exercise price of the Private Placement Warrants during the period when the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable, the Private Placement Warrants may not have any value.\nThe warrants will be immediately exercisable and expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. The Private Placement Warrants will have an initial exercise price per share equal to $11.50. In the event that our common stock price does not exceed the exercise price of the Private Placement Warrants during the period when the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable, the Private Placement Warrants may not have any value.\nThere is no established trading market for the Private Placement Warrants and the market for the Private Placement Warrants may be highly volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance. We do not intend to list the Private Placement Warrants, nor do we expect the Private Placement Warrants to be quoted, on any securities exchange.\nThere must be a current registration statement in order for you to exercise the Private Placement Warrants.\nHolders of Private Placement Warrants will be able to exercise the Private Placement Warrants only if a current registration statement relating to the common stock underlying the Private Placement Warrants is then in effect. Although we will attempt to maintain the effectiveness of a current registration statement covering the common stock underlying the Private Placement Warrants, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. If the registration statement covering the shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants is no longer effective, the Private Placement Warrants may only be exercised on a \u201ccashless\u201d basis and will be issued with restrictive legends unless such shares are eligible for sale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nHolders of our Private Placement Warrants will have no rights as a common stockholder until they acquire our common stock.\nUntil you acquire shares of our common stock upon exercise of your Private Placement Warrants, you will have no rights with respect to our common stock. Upon exercise of your Private Placement Warrants, you will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.", "PERMNO": 16988, "SIC": 7900, "TIC": "WINR"}
