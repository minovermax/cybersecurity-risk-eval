{"cik": "1411579", "company": "AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors Associated with AMC\u2019s Business\nOur business depends on motion picture production and performance and is subject to intense competition, including increases in alternative film delivery methods or other forms of entertainment.\nOur ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets. The most attended films are usually released during the summer and the calendar year-end holidays, making our business highly seasonal. We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios. Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, the choice by distributors to release fewer feature-length movies theatrically, or the choice to release feature-length movies directly to video streaming platforms could hurt our business and results of operations. Conversely, the successful performance of these motion pictures, particularly the sustained success of any one motion picture, or an increase in effective marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, may generate positive results for our business and operations in a specific fiscal quarter or year that may not necessarily be indicative of, or comparable to, future results of operations. As movie studios rely on a smaller number of higher grossing \u201ctent pole\u201d films there may be increased pressure for higher film licensing fees. Our loyalty program and certain promotional pricing also may affect performance and increase the cost to license motion pictures relative to revenue for admission. In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios and the theatrical exclusive release window may adversely affect the demographic base of movie-goers.\nOur theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which we operate. Competitors may be multi-national circuits, national circuits, regional circuits or smaller independent exhibitors.\nCompetition among theatre exhibition companies is often intense with respect to attracting patrons, terms for licensing of motion pictures and availability and securing and maintaining desirable locations.\nWe also compete with other film delivery methods, including video streaming, network, syndicated cable and satellite television, as well as video-on-demand, pay-per-view services. We also compete for the public\u2019s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, amusement parks, live music concerts, live theatre, and restaurants. An increase in the popularity of these alternative film delivery methods and other forms of entertainment could reduce attendance at our theatres, limit the prices we can charge for admission and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on distributors of motion pictures, over whom we have no control, for the films that we exhibit, and our business may be adversely affected if our access to motion pictures is limited or delayed.\nMajor motion picture distributors are required by law to offer and license film to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Moreover, in the event of changes to applicable law, including the potential termination of the consent decrees (see the Regulatory Environment section), these practices may change ways that cannot be predicted. Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors, as this affects our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films or to obtain licenses at all. With only six distributors representing approximately 80% of our U.S. and International markets\u2019 box office revenues in 2019, there is a high level of concentration and continued consolidation in the industry. Our business may be adversely affected if our access to motion pictures is limited or delayed because of deterioration in our relationships with one or more distributors or for some other reason. To the extent that we are unable to license a popular film for exhibition in our theatres, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our operations and prevent us from satisfying those debt obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding approximately $4,853.3 million of indebtedness ($5,010.7 million face amount), which consisted of $1,961.4 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility ($1,985.0 million face amount), $515.6 million of our existing Convertible Notes due 2024 ($600.0 million face amount), $2,276.4 million of our existing subordinated notes ($2,325.8 million face amount), and $99.9 million of existing finance lease obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we had $215.0 million available for borrowing, net of letters of credit, under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and \u00a389.2 million ($117.0 million) available for borrowing (subject to limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness in our various debt instruments) under our Odeon Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, we also had approximately $5.5 billion of discounted rental payments under operating leases (with initial base terms generally between 12 to 15 years). The amount of our indebtedness and lease and other financial obligations could have important consequences to our stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of lease rentals and principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for operations, dividends and any future business opportunities;\n\u25cf limit our planning flexibility for, or ability to react to, changes in our business and the industry; and\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness and other obligations or greater access to financing.\nIf we fail to make any required payment under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures governing our notes or to comply with any of the financial and operating covenants contained therein, we would be in default. Lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or holders of our notes, as applicable, could then decide to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures and in the case of the Senior Credit Facility, foreclose upon the stock and personal property of our subsidiaries that is pledged to secure the Senior\nSecured Credit Facility. Other creditors might then accelerate other indebtedness. If the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility or holders of our notes accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness thereunder, we might not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the indentures, or our other indebtedness. Our indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facility bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing interest rates (although, subject to certain conditions, such rates may be fixed for certain periods). If interest rates increase, we may be unable to meet our debt service obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and other indebtedness.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flows or have sufficient restricted payment capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures governing our debt securities to pay our intended dividends on our Class A common stock and will suffer contractual penalties related to the Convertible Notes due 2024 if we do not reduce per-share dividend amounts paid on our Class A common stock during 2020.\nSubject to legally available funds, we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends. We will only be able to pay dividends from our available cash on hand and funds received from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries' ability to make distributions to us will depend on their ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is subject to the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Our operating cash flow and ability to comply with restricted payment covenants in our debt instruments will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed, and our board of directors may decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends. We may not pay dividends as a result of the following additional factors, among others:\n\u25cf we are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends;\n\u25cf while we currently intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend, this policy could be modified or revoked at any time;\n\u25cf even if we do not modify or revoke our dividend policy, the actual amount of dividends distributed and the decision to make any distribution is entirely at the discretion of our board of directors and future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, business opportunities, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant;\n\u25cf the amount of dividends distributed is and will be subject to contractual restrictions under the restrictive payment covenants contained in:\n\u25cf the indentures governing our debt securities,\n\u25cf the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility,\n\u25cf the terms of our Convertible Notes due 2024,\n\u25cf the terms of any other outstanding or future indebtedness incurred by us or any of our subsidiaries; and\n\u25cf the amount of dividends distributed is subject to state law restrictions.\nThe maximum amount we would be permitted to distribute in accordance with our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our notes was approximately $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. As a result of the foregoing limitations on our ability to make distributions, we cannot give assurance that we will be able to make all of our intended quarterly dividend payments. Moreover, we will suffer contractual penalties under the terms of the Convertible Notes due 2024 in the form of an adjustment to the conversion rate if dividends are not reduced to not greater than $0.10 per share after September 14, 2020.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that may limit our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities advantageous to us.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders;\n\u25cf make restricted payments;\n\u25cf incur liens;\n\u25cf engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25cf enter into business combinations.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions, fund needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. At the same time, the covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness may not provide investors with protections against transactions they may deem undesirable.\nIf our cash flows prove inadequate to service our debt and provide for our other obligations, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or future debt at terms unfavorable to us.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and other financial obligations and to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. This will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.\nIn addition, our debt obligations require us to repay or refinance our obligations when they come due. If our cash flows were to prove inadequate to meet our debt service, rental and other obligations in the future, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing or future debt, on or before maturity, to sell assets or to obtain additional financing. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our Senior Secured Credit Facility and our notes, sell any such assets, or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict, but do not prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness. If we are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Facility and our other outstanding debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face may intensify.\nLimitations on the availability of capital and reductions to capital expenditures may delay or prevent deployment of strategic initiatives.\nImplementation of our key strategic initiatives, including recliner seating, enhanced food and beverage and premium sight and sound, require significant capital expenditures. Our gross capital expenditures were approximately $518.1 million, $576.3 million, and $628.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and, December 31, 2017, respectively. We estimate that our cash outflows for capital expenditures, net of landlord contributions, will be approximately $275.0 million to $300.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2020. The lack of available capital resources due to business performance or other financial commitments could prevent or delay the deployment of innovations in our theatres. We may reduce capital expenditures significantly or seek additional financing or issue additional securities, which may affect the timing and scope of growth strategy. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain new financing on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, covenants under our existing indebtedness limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, and the performance of any additional or improved theatres may not be sufficient to service the related indebtedness that we are permitted to incur.\nOur results of operations may be impacted by shrinking theatrical exclusive release windows.\nOver the last decade, the average theatrical exclusive release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film\u2019s theatrical release to the date a film is available to consumers in-home, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months. If distributors choose to further decrease or eliminate the theatrical exclusive release window or patrons choose to wait for in-home viewing options rather than attend a theatre for viewing the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash\nflows. We cannot give assurance that this release window, which is determined by the film studios, will not shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe may incur future impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets and future theatre and other closure charges.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $4,789.1 million. Based on sustained declines in our market capitalization during 2019, we performed quantitative goodwill impairment tests as of September 30, 2019 and additional qualitative tests as of December 31, 2019. Considering the results of these tests, management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate multiples and discount rates to be used in estimating fair value, and application of a market participant acquisition premium, we determined that the goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was not impaired. In addition, following our adoption of ASC 842, certain data providers in the analyst community have characterized our operating lease liabilities as indebtedness, which has the impact of increasing our leverage as reported by these data providers and, we believe, has and may continue to negatively affect our share price and market capitalization. If the market price of our common stock sustains its current levels for an extended period or further declines, if the fair value of our debt declines, or if other events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their respective carrying value, all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired in future periods.\nWe review long-lived assets, including goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other intangible assets and theatre assets (including operating lease right-of-use lease assets) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The review for goodwill compares the fair value for each of our reporting units to their associated carrying value. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, and declines in the market price of our common stock or declines in the fair value of our debt. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance, including assessing our corporate borrowings and finance lease obligations estimates of fair value. We may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist. During the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, we recorded impairment of long-lived asset charges of $84.3 million (including $60.0 million related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets, which were recorded in connection with the adoption of ASC 842-Leases), $13.8 million, and $43.6 million, respectively. The assets impaired during year 2019 included 40 theatres in the U.S. markets with 512 screens (in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming), 14 theatres in the International markets with 148 screens (in Germany, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom) and a U.S. property held and not used. In addition, we recorded an impairment loss of $3.6 million recorded to investment expense (income) related to an equity interest investment during 2019.\nOur business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of our international operations, 26.5% of our revenues were derived from countries outside the United States for the year ended December 31, 2019. The success of our international operations is dependent upon our ability to operate a business in markets where we have limited experience and is subject to risks that are beyond our control. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n\u25cf difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations among diverse geographies, languages and cultures;\n\u25cf the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;\n\u25cf the impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union and the potential that other countries could also exit;\n\u25cf fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could lead to fluctuations in our reported results of operations or result in significant decreases in the value of our international investments as denominated in U.S. Dollars;\n\u25cf increased foreign interest rates, foreign exchange fees and other bank charges as a result of financing our foreign operations;\n\u25cf exposure to anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K. Bribery Act (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d), and export-control regulations and economic sanctions regulations, including those promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, United States Department of Treasury (\u201cOFAC\u201d);\n\u25cf exposure to local economic conditions and local laws and regulations;\n\u25cf exposure to local labor and employment laws;\n\u25cf relationships with local labor unions and works councils;\n\u25cf limited borrowing capabilities relating to activities in non-U.S. countries;\n\u25cf economic and/or credit conditions abroad;\n\u25cf potential adverse changes in the political and/or economic stability of foreign countries or in their diplomatic relations with the United States;\n\u25cf restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;\n\u25cf government policies against businesses owned by foreigners;\n\u25cf investment restrictions or requirements;\n\u25cf diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries;\n\u25cf difficulty in protecting our brand, reputation and intellectual property;\n\u25cf restrictions on the ability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation;\n\u25cf foreign exchange restrictions;\n\u25cf adverse changes in regulatory or tax requirements;\n\u25cf restrictions on foreign ownership of subsidiaries;\n\u25cf data protection and privacy laws, including GDPR, which became effective in May 2018 and similar pending domestic laws such as the California Privacy Act, which becomes effective in 2020, and other restrictions on transferring personally identifiable information outside of a jurisdiction; and\n\u25cf tariffs and other trade barriers.\nIf we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe decision by British voters to exit the European Union may negatively impact our operations.\nEffective as of January 31, 2020, the U.K. exited from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). While the U.K. has agreed to the terms of its exit from the European Union, both sides are deciding the future terms of their relationship through an implementation period that concludes on December 31, 2020. The final outcome of these negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the terms negotiated during the implementation period and may include, among other things, greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and European Union countries, a fluctuation in currency exchange rates and additional regulatory complexity. Additional currency volatility could drive a weaker British pound, which increases the cost of goods imported into our U.K. operations and may decrease the profitability of our U.K. operations. A weaker British pound versus the U.S. dollar also causes local currency results of our U.K.\noperations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars during a reporting period and currency volatility makes this translation less predictable. Our operations in the U.K. and Europe, as well as our United States operations, could be impacted by the global economic uncertainty caused by Brexit or the actual withdrawal by the U.K. from the European Union. If we are unable to manage any of these risks effectively, our business could be adversely affected. With a range of outcomes still possible, the impact from Brexit remains uncertain and will depend, in part, on the final outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations.\nOptimizing our theatre circuit through new construction and the transformation of our existing theatres may be subject to delay and unanticipated costs.\nThe availability of attractive site locations for new construction is subject to various factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf local conditions, such as scarcity of space or increase in demand for real estate, demographic changes and changes in zoning and tax laws; and\n\u25cf competition for site locations from both theatre companies and other businesses.\nWe typically require 18 to 24 months in the United States from the time we reach an agreement with a landlord to when a theatre opens. This timeframe may vary as we introduce this concept in international markets.\nIn addition, the improvement of our existing theatres through our enhanced food and beverage and recliner seating and premium sight and sound initiatives is subject to substantial risks, such as difficulty in obtaining permits, landlord approvals and operating licenses (e.g. liquor licenses). We may also experience cost overruns from delays or other unanticipated costs in both new construction and facility improvements. Furthermore, our new sites and transformed locations may not perform to our expectations.\nWe rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and any failure to protect these systems against security breaches or failure of these systems themselves could adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity and could result in litigation and penalties. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. Among other things, these systems collect and store certain personal information from customers, vendors and employees and process customer payment information. Additionally, open-source internet ticketing allows tickets for all of our theatres to be sold by various third-party vendors on websites using information systems we do not control. Our information systems and those maintained by our third-party vendors and the sensitive data they are designed to protect are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers, cyber terrorists and other cyber attackers. We rely on industry-accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems, and we rely on our third-party vendors to take appropriate measures to protect the confidentiality of the information on those information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. Our information systems may become unavailable or fail to perform as anticipated for any reason, including viruses, loss of power or human error. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or those maintained by our third-party vendors or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, vendors and employees and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. A significant interruption, failure or breach of the security of our information systems or those of our third-party vendors could also require us to expend significant resources to upgrade the security measures and technology that guard sensitive data against computer hackers, cyber terrorists and other cyber attackers. We maintain cyber risk insurance coverage to protect against such risks, however, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate.\nWe may be limited in our ability to utilize, or may not be able to utilize, interest deduction carryforwards or net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax liability.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) included a number of significant tax provisions including (1) limiting interest deductions for years 2018 through 2021 to 30% of taxable EBITDA, (2) limiting interest deductions for 2022 and thereafter to 30% of taxable EBIT, (3) limiting the utilization of net operating losses generated in calendar year 2018 and thereafter to 80% of taxable income, and (4) providing an indefinite carryover period for interest expense carryforwards and net operating losses generated in calendar year 2018 and thereafter.\nOur current capital structure makes it highly likely we will have significant limitations on our currently deductible interest expense. There can be no assurance, however, that we will generate sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period to utilize any net operating loss carryforwards before they expire, but due to the limitations on deductible interest expense it appears likely we will be able to utilize a majority of our pre-calendar year 2018 net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. However, because any interest carryover amounts retain their character as interest, in future years we may not be able to realize the benefit of any accumulated interest carryforwards.\nAlthough we have experienced numerous \u201cownership changes\u201d within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the IRC, including our merger with Wanda in August 2012, the only remaining applicable restrictions are related to net operating losses acquired in the Carmike acquisition of approximately $22.4 million with annual limitation of $1.7 million. The remaining net operating losses of $358.5 million are not subject to any limitation.\nWe are subject to complex taxation, changes in tax rates, adoption of new United States, European Union or international tax legislation and disagreements with tax authorities that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to many different forms of taxation in both the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Current economic and political conditions, including Brexit and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (\u201cOECD\u201d) proposed recommendations around taxation in the Digital Economy, make tax rates, transfer pricing compliance and tax regulations, including in the U.S., U.K, and European Union subject to significant change. Recent examples include the Court of Justice of the European Union narrowing the EU Interest & Royalty withholding directive, OECD recommendations on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d), the European Commission\u2019s Anti-Tax Avoidance Package and the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017.\nThe cost of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets may not be realizable to the extent our future profits are less than we have projected and we may be required to record valuation allowances against previously-recorded deferred tax assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from changes in temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, credit carryforwards, interest expense carryforwards and net operating losses. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance jurisdiction by jurisdiction on an ongoing basis. In evaluating our deferred income tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and before our tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards expire. Our assessment of the realizability of our deferred income tax assets requires significant judgement. If we fail to achieve our projections or if we need to lower our projections, we may not have sufficient evidence of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and we may need to increase our valuation allowance.\nOur U.S. cumulative pretax losses have raised uncertainty about the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets, and as a result we recorded a valuation allowance against all of the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, except those deemed indefinite-lived for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our domestic cumulative pre-tax losses continue to raise uncertainty about the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets. For our U.S. jurisdiction, we recorded an increase in valuation allowance of $49.7 million and total tax expense of $11.9 million for 2019.\nAn international valuation allowance previously established against deferred tax assets in Spain was released in the fourth quarter of 2019 resulting in a $41.5 million benefit to income tax expense. Cumulative statutory pretax profits over multiple years along with a sustained trend line of increasing profitability provided sufficient evidence that it was more likely than not the deferred assets would be realized.\nThere are no assurances that we will not increase or decrease the valuation allowances in future periods against deferred tax expense; likewise, any decrease would result in additional deferred tax benefit. Any deferred tax expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe accounting methods for our convertible debt securities may have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn accounting for Convertible Notes due 2024, we identified certain features that are bifurcated and accounted for as derivatives. Under the applicable accounting guidance, the derivatives must be marked to market each reporting period. The fluctuation in the fair value between reporting periods is recorded in that period and impacts net earnings. These changes in the fair value will create volatility in our net earnings. Additionally, we recorded a debt discount based on the fair value of the derivative liability related to the conversion feature upon issuance, which will be accreted to interest expense over the term of the agreement. This will impact non-cash interest expense in the current period presented and future periods. Certain of these features will be determined in the third quarter of 2020 which may have a further impact upon diluted earnings per share based on applicable adjustments to the conversion rate under the Convertible Notes due 2024.\nIn addition, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes due 2024) that may be settled in cash, shares or a combination of cash and shares may utilize the if-converted method which we have elected to use to compute earnings per share, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share to the extent that they are dilutive. Under the if-converted method the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle all of the Convertible Notes due 2024 are included in diluted earnings per share. This may cause further volatility in our diluted earnings per share.\nThe elimination of the calculation of USD LIBOR rates may impact our contracts that are indexed to USD LIBOR.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. We have material contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR and we are monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks.\nWe may be reviewed by antitrust authorities.\nGiven our size and market share, pursuit of acquisition opportunities that would increase the number of our theatres in markets where we have a leading market share would likely result in significant review by antitrust regulators in the applicable jurisdictions, and we may be required to dispose of theatres in order to complete such acquisition opportunities. As a result, we may not be able to succeed in acquiring other exhibition companies or we may have to dispose of a significant number of theatres in key markets in order to complete such acquisitions.\nWe operate in a consolidating industry that is scrutinized from time to time for compliance with antitrust and competition laws, including currently dormant investigations into film clearances and joint ventures among competing exhibitors. If we were found to have violated antitrust laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to substantial government regulation, which could entail significant cost.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices both domestically and internationally affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating antitrust, health and sanitation standards, equal employment, environmental, licensing for the sale of food and, in some theatres, alcoholic beverages, and data protection and privacy laws, including GDPR, CCPA, and other pending future domestic privacy laws and regulations. Our new theatre openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing theatres could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business. A significant portion of our theatre level employees are part time workers who are paid at or near the applicable minimum wage in the theatre\u2019s jurisdiction. Increases in the minimum wage and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.\nWe own and operate facilities throughout the United States and various international markets throughout Europe and are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of those jurisdictions, particularly laws governing the\ncleanup of hazardous materials and the management of properties. We might in the future be required to participate in the cleanup of a property that we own or lease, or at which we have been alleged to have disposed of hazardous materials from one of our facilities. In certain circumstances, we might be solely responsible for any such liability under environmental laws, and such claims could be material.\nIn the U.S., our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d). Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations, including websites and mobile apps for such public accommodations, \u201creasonably accommodate\u201d individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to \u201ccommercial facilities\u201d conform to accessibility guidelines unless \u201cstructurally impracticable\u201d for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and an award of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In Europe, all territories have similar national regulations relating to disabilities that our theatres operate in accordance with. Noncompliance with these regulations could carry financial, operational and reputation risks.\nGeneral political, social and economic conditions can reduce our attendance.\nOur success depends on general political, social, and economic conditions and the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres. If going to motion pictures becomes less popular or consumers spend less on food and beverage, our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our operations could be adversely affected if consumers\u2019 discretionary income falls as a result of an economic downturn. Geopolitical events, including the threat of terrorism or cyber-attacks, or widespread health emergencies, such as the novel coronavirus or other pandemics or epidemics, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance. In addition, due to our concentration in certain markets, natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes in those markets could adversely affect our overall results of operations.\nWe depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.\nOur current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the retention of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss or unavailability of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot give assurance that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms.\nOur controlling shareholder owns more than 74% of the combined voting power of our common stock and has significant influence over our corporate management and affairs.\nOur Class B common stock has three votes per share, and our Class A common stock (the publicly traded stock) has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2019, Wanda owns 51,769,784 shares of Class B common stock, or 49.85% of our outstanding common stock, representing approximately 74.89% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As such, Wanda has significant influence over our reporting and corporate management and affairs, and, because of the three-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, Wanda will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval (including election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers) so long as the shares of Class B common stock owned by Wanda and its permitted transferees represent at least 30% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. The shares of our Class B common stock automatically convert to shares of Class A common stock upon Wanda and its permitted transferees holding less than 30% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock.\nThere may be future dilution of our Class A common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our Class A common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of Class A common stock to raise cash to refinance indebtedness, for working capital, to finance strategic initiatives and future acquisitions or for other purposes. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock or just shares of Class A common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of Class A common stock. Any of these events may dilute the ownership interests of current stockholders, reduce our earnings per share or have an adverse effect on the price of our shares of Class A common stock. In addition, the conversion of some or all of our Convertible Notes due 2024, to the extent we deliver shares of\nClass A common stock upon conversion thereof, would dilute the ownership interests of current stockholders, reduce our earnings per share and potentially have an adverse effect on the price of our shares of Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2019, the $600.0 million principal balance of our Convertible Notes due 2024 would be convertible into 31,662,269 shares of Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our shares of Class A common stock.\nWanda holds shares of our Class B common stock, all of which constitute \"restricted securities\" under the Securities Act. The shares of our Class B common stock automatically convert to Class A common stock (1) if transferred to a person other than certain permitted transferees or (2) upon Wanda and its permitted transferees holding less than 30% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Provided the holders comply with the applicable volume limits and other conditions prescribed in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, all of these restricted securities are currently freely tradeable. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated December 23, 2013, we have agreed to use our best efforts to effect registered offerings upon request from Wanda and to grant incidental or \"piggyback\" registration rights with respect to any registrable securities held by Wanda. The obligation to effect any demand for registration by Wanda will be subject to certain conditions, including limitations on the number of demand registrations and limitations on the minimum value of securities to be registered. We have also agreed to use our best efforts to grant certain incidental or \"piggyback\" registration rights with respect to securities issued to certain current and former officers. In connection with the sale of our Convertible Notes due 2024, we have agreed, subject to certain conditions, to use our reasonable efforts to effect registered offerings on behalf of holders of the Convertible Notes due 2024 with respect to the securities held by them and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion thereof. We filed a registration statement with the SEC on December 14, 2018 to fulfill this requirement. The exercise of such registration rights by Wanda, the holders of the Convertible Notes due 2024 and/or the current and former officers may substantially increase the number of shares of Class A common stock in the public market and could reduce the market price of shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe super voting rights of our Class B common stock and other anti-takeover protections in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage or prevent a takeover of our Company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the supermajority rights of our Class B common stockholder, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third-party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u25cf a dual class common stock structure, which provides Wanda with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\n\u25cf a classified board of directors;\n\u25cf the sole power of a majority of the board of directors to fix the number of directors;\n\u25cf limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u25cf the sole power of the board of directors to fill any vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to designate one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and\n\u25cf the inability of stockholders to call special meetings.\nOur issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.\nOur incorporation under Delaware law, the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock or a stockholder rights plan and certain other provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving our company or the replacement of our management or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our Class A common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our Class A common stock.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our Class A common stock.\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.\nIn addition, the issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our Class A common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive. For example, investors may not wish to purchase Class A common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase Class A common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of Class A common stock.", "PERMNO": 14328, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "AMC"}
