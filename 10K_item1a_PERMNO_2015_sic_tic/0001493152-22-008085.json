{"cik": "1349929", "company": "Vyant Bio, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk including the risk of a loss of your entire investment. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information contained in this report and the other reports we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The risks set forth below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties may exist that could also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. If any of the following risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and/or operations could suffer. In such event, the value of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a substantial portion of the money that you have paid for our common stock.\nSummary of Risk Factors\n\u25cf We have a history of net losses, expect to incur net losses in the future and may never achieve sustained profitability.\n\u25cf We have limited experience in drug discovery and drug development, and we have never advanced a drug to human development or had a drug approved alone or with collaborators.\n\u25cf We may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover drug candidates and may fail to capitalize on programs, collaborations, or drug candidates that may present a greater commercial opportunity or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\n\u25cf We do not have any experience in clinical development and have not advanced any drug candidates into clinical development.\n\u25cf Clinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement, and have traditionally had high attrition.\n\u25cf Our future revenue is unpredictable and operating results are expected to fluctuate from period to period.\n\u25cf Our business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the global outbreak of COVID-19.\n\u25cf The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming, expensive and inherently challenging, and if we or our collaborators are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates, our business could be significantly limited.\n\u25cf Our success depends upon achieving a critical mass of customers and strategic relationships.\n\u25cf We may acquire other businesses or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm operating results, dilute its stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\n\u25cf We may not be able to sell the vivoPharm business and/or any sales we consummate may not produce the desired results.\n\u25cf If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our products and processes, or if the scope of the patent and other intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\n\u25cf The loss or transition of any member of our senior management team or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, clinicians and salespeople could adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf If we are unable to manage growth, our prospects may be limited, and our future results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\u25cf Because we do not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future, you must rely on appreciation of our common stock price for any return on your investment. Even we change that policy, we may be restricted from paying dividends on our common stock.\nRisks Relating to the Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have a history of net losses, expect to incur net losses in the future and may never achieve sustained profitability.\nWe have historically incurred substantial net losses. We had net losses of $40.9 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $78.8 million as of December 31, 2021. The 2021 results including a net loss from discontinuing operations of $22.3 million, which includes a $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge as well as continuing operations non-cash expenses of $4.8 million and merger related costs of $2.3 million. We expect losses to continue. These losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our revenue growth and costs associated with being a public company, we are unable to predict when we will become profitable, and we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our inability to achieve, and then maintain, profitability would negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPrior to the Merger and receipt of the net proceeds of the financings that were a condition of the Merger, recurring losses from operations raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern, and we may need to raise additional capital by issuing securities or debt or through licensing arrangements, which may cause dilution to stockholders or restrict operations or proprietary rights.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of $16.5 million and $5.8 million, respectively. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities.\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $20.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The Company\u2019s management has projected that the Company\u2019s cash on hand, together with net proceeds from the planned sale of the vivoPharm business during 2022 as well as proceeds from sales of common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (as defined below) with Lincoln Park Capital, LLC will be adequate to fund the Company\u2019s currently planned operations into the second quarter of 2023. Such estimate may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, and/or the capital resources that we are assuming will be present could fail to materialize at the amounts we project or at all\nFor instance, changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Future capital requirements depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the rate at which invest in our disease model and therapeutic drug development;\n\u25cf the rate at which we are able to enter into strategic relationships;\n\u25cf the extent to which we commence development activities for new therapeutic indications;\n\u25cf the response of competitors to our products and services;\n\u25cf the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights including enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims; and\n\u25cf the costs of operating as a public company.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances, licensing arrangements or monetization transactions. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, convertible debt securities or other equity-based derivative securities, our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect shareholder rights. Any indebtedness we incur would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Furthermore, the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline and existing shareholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances, licensing arrangements or monetization transactions with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, or our products, or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur future revenue is unpredictable and operating results are expected to fluctuate from period to period.\nThe emerging nature of the markets in which we compete make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our revenue in any given period.\nHistorically, most of our revenue has been derived from our vivoPharm business, which we have committed to a plan to sell. Revenue from StemoniX have historically derived from the sale of iPSC-based microOrgan plates to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and research customers or the performance of DaaS for these customers. We anticipate revenue generated from these activities will substantially cease in the first half of 2022, and we will focus on our therapeutic drug discovery and development using our iPSC human disease models. Therefore, we will not generate revenue until we are able to successfully develop and discover drug candidates and partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other industry partners.\nTo date, we have not generated revenue from licensing our iPSC disease models or therapeutic assets. Additionally, our ability to obtain license and/or subscription agreements with pharmaceutical companies and other industry partners is unproven, and in the best of circumstances it may take several months or more in order to enter into such agreements. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in entering into collaborations with pharmaceutical companies, artificial intelligence/technology and other industry partners. Moreover, even after entering into such agreements, it may take months or years before they generate revenue, if at all. There is no assurance that any revenue generated will recover the costs\nFor these reasons, it is difficult for us to predict, when, if ever, we will generate revenue and become profitable.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate substantially from period to period as a result of several factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf the ability to derive licensing contracts for Company-identified drug candidates or Company developed human iPSC disease models;\n\u25cf the ability to enter into successful strategic relationships;\n\u25cf the unpredictable expenses associated with drug development and clinical trials;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our operations;\n\u25cf the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced technologies, products, or services by competitors; and\n\u25cf the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nCGI identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to remediate the material weakness and otherwise maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of its financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d) requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nDuring the audit for the 2020 fiscal year of CGI, the accounting predecessor (as the Merger was a reverse merger) and legal acquiror of StemoniX, identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to our accounting for the potential impairment of intangible assets. This material weakness was not remediated at the time of the Merger and therefore, became part of the post-Merger internal control structure of Vyant Bio. This accounting requires us to record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable and is in excess of the fair value of the asset group. CGI\u2019s calculation of undiscounted future cash flows resulted in a conclusion that no impairment was necessary, however, we could not supply supporting evidence that its calculation was accurate.\nWe began the process of implementing changes to its internal control over intangible assets to remediate the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weakness, and implemented the following enhancements to internal controls to address this material weakness:\n\u25cf Hired a new CFO with significant experience in internal controls, US GAAP and financial forecasting;\n\u25cf Established a financial planning and analysis function in June 2021 to analyze, forecast and report on the Company\u2019s operations; and\n\u25cf Developed a financial model to forecast vivoPharm revenue based on inputs from management.\nWe determined that the underlying revenue forecasting model to support the determination of cash flows for our vivoPharm business contained data input errors that required additional analysis and validation during the first quarter of 2022. While these data errors did not impact our assessment of the carrying value of our vivoPharm business as of December 31, 2021, the redesign of this control and ongoing testing of its operational effectiveness will not occur until 2022. As a result, the Company concluded that the deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting related to revenue and cash flow forecasting would give rise to the level of a material weakness as of December 31, 2021. The Company expects to remediate this control in 2022 through enhanced data validation and management review.\nOur ability to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could impact the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet its reporting obligations. For as long as we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under the U.S. securities laws, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting could detect problems that management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nWe do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure of its control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Strategy\nOur business is subject to risks arising from epidemic diseases, such as the global outbreak of COVID-19.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19 or other public health epidemic, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, courier delivery services and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 and its variants, and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt the supply chain of material needed for our business and could delay future projects from commencing due to COVID-19 related impacts on the demand for our services and therefore have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our customers worldwide were impacted by COVID-19 and temporarily closed their facilities which impacted revenue in the first half of 2020 for our StemoniX business. While the impact of the pandemic on our business has lessened, the global outbreak of COVID-19 continues with new variants and is impacting the way we operate our business as well as in certain circumstances limiting the availability of lab supplies. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the our future business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nWe are actively monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, results of operations and financial condition. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future is unknown at this time and will depend on future developments that are highly unpredictable.\nWe face competition in drug discovery from other biotechnology, pharmaceutical, artificial intelligence and other drug discovery companies and technologies and our operating results may be negatively affected if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology, pharmaceutical and drug discovery and development industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have competitors in a number of jurisdictions, many of which have substantially greater name recognition, commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. Established competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel compounds that could make our drug candidates obsolete or uneconomical. Any new product that competes with an approved product may need to demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, cost, convenience, tolerability and safety to be commercially successful. In recent years drug discovery has integrated biology, chemistry and technology, including machine learning, augmented and artificial intelligence as well as several forms of human cells to accelerate research and development activities and its effectiveness and efficiency. Other competitive factors, including generic competition, could force us to lower prices or could result in reduced sales. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to our drug candidates. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nWe have limited experience in drug discovery, drug development, disease model development and clinical development, and we have never advanced a drug to human development or had a drug approved alone or with collaborators.\nThe convergence in drug discovery of human organoid disease models along with new in silico technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and new chemistry creation is unproven. There is limited evidence that such an approach will reduce time and risk around preclinical development. Regarding our business model to date, we are pursuing two distinct but parallel tracks to identify novel and repurposed drug therapies: we develop and license access to human cell-derived disease models, and in conjunction with applying data science and in vivo testing, use this technology to identify candidates to bring through the discovery phase which we plan to then partner with pharmaceutical companies to pursue clinical development and commercialization. We may also out license our iPSC disease model development capabilities to strategic partners to co-develop drugs associated with such disease models. To date, we have made very limited independent drug discovery efforts, have not licensed our iPSC disease models and no assurances can be given that we will be successful in generating revenue from these activities.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy is to attempt to file approximately two investigational new drug (\u201cIND\u201d) applications with United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) starting in 2023 and perform clinical trials up through Phase I. We do not have any experience in clinical development and have not advanced any drug candidates into clinical development. Our lack of experience in conducting clinical development activities may adversely impact the likelihood that we will be successful in advancing our programs, if we are not able to find experienced partners. Further, any predictions you make about the future success or viability of our internal drug discovery programs may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of conducting clinical trials and developing our own drug candidates.\nIn addition, as our internal drug discovery business grows, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other known and unknown factors. Our internal drug discovery business may need to transition to a business capable of supporting clinical development activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\nOur approach to the discovery and development of drug candidates based on our microOrgan plates and our AnalytiX tools is novel and unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any products of commercial value.\nWe are leveraging our microOrgan plates and our AnalytiX tools to attempt to create a pipeline of drug candidates for patients whose diseases have not been adequately addressed to date by other approaches, and to identify drug candidates with a higher likelihood of success in clinical trials. While we believe that our technology may potentially enable drug research and clinical development that is more efficient than conventional drug research and development, our approach is both novel and unproven. Because our approach is both novel and unproven, the cost and time needed to discover our drug candidates is difficult to predict, and our efforts may not result in the discovery and development of commercially viable medicines or therapies. We may also be incorrect about the effects of any drug candidates we pursue on disease states, which may limit the utility of our approach or the perception of the utility of our approach. Furthermore, our estimates of our defined patient populations available for study and treatment may be lower than expected, which could adversely affect our or our partners\u2019 ability to conduct clinical trials and may also adversely affect the size of any market for medicines we may license for commercialization. Our approach may not result in time savings, higher success rates or reduced costs as we expect it to, and if not, we may not attract collaborators or develop new drugs as quickly or cost effectively as expected and therefore we may not be able to commercialize our approach as expected at this time.\nWe may never realize return on our investment of resources and cash in our drug discovery collaborations.\nWe intend to use our high-throughput drug screening on our microOrgan plate technology and use our data science-based AnalytiX tools to quickly test and evaluate a drug for toxicity and efficacy. We believe such technologies, which we have developed at significant expense, will provide us or our collaborators with valuable drug discovery insights. Our collaborators could include start-up, pre-commercial biotechnology, in silico and large-scale pharmaceutical companies. When we engage in drug discovery with these collaborators, we will strive to receive a mixture of upfront payments, including licensing fees, milestone-based fees, and ongoing royalty payments in addition to any charges for in vivo, in vitro and in silico testing, and our SaaS services. However, we have not yet been successful in generating any significant payments or contracts using this business model and may never be.\nWe may never enter into any material drug discovery collaborations nor realize return on our investment of resources and cash in our drug discovery collaborations. Drug discovery is complex, capital intensive and is prone to high failure rates and uncertain outcomes. Our drug discovery collaborators may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of any drug candidates. In addition, our ability to realize return from our drug discovery collaborations is subject to the following risks, among others:\n\u25cf drug discovery collaborators have significant discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to our collaborations and may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u25cf drug discovery collaborators may not pursue development or commercialization of any drug candidates for which we are entitled to option fees, milestone payments, or royalties or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on results of clinical trials or other studies, changes in the collaborator\u2019s strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u25cf drug discovery collaborators may delay clinical trials for which we are entitled to milestone payments;\n\u25cf we may not have access to, or may be restricted from disclosing, certain information regarding our collaborators\u2019 drug candidates being developed or commercialized and, consequently, may have limited ability to inform our stockholders about the status of, and likelihood of achieving, milestone payments or royalties under such collaborations;\n\u25cf drug discovery collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with any drug candidates and products for which we are entitled to milestone payments or royalties if the collaborator believes that the competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive;\n\u25cf drug candidates discovered in drug discovery collaborations with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own drug candidates or products, which may cause our collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of any such drug candidates;\n\u25cf drug discovery collaborators may begin to perceive us to be a competitor more generally, particularly if we advance our internal drug discovery programs, and therefore may be unwilling to continue then existing collaborations with us or to enter into new collaborations with us;\n\u25cf a drug discovery collaborator may fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the development, manufacture, distribution, or marketing of a drug candidate or product, which may impact our ability to receive milestone payments;\n\u25cf disagreements with drug discovery collaborators, including disagreements over intellectual property or proprietary rights, contract interpretation, or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or terminations of the research, development, or commercialization of drug candidates for which we are eligible to receive milestone payments, or might result in litigation or arbitration;\n\u25cf drug discovery collaborators may not properly obtain, maintain, enforce, defend or protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to potentially lead to disputes or legal proceedings that could jeopardize or invalidate our or their intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us and them to potential litigation;\n\u25cf drug discovery collaborators may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u25cf drug discovery collaborators could suffer from operational delays as a result of global health impacts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf drug discovery collaborations may be terminated prior to our receipt of any significant value from the collaboration.\nAny drug discovery collaborations we enter into may not lead to development or commercialization of drug candidates that results in our receipt of fees, milestone payments, or royalties in a timely manner, or at all. If any drug discovery collaborations that we enter into do not result in the successful development and commercialization of drug products that result in fees, milestone payments, or royalties to us, we may not receive return on the resources we have invested in the drug discovery collaboration. Moreover, even if a drug discovery collaboration initially leads to the achievement of milestones that result in payments to us, it may not continue to do so.\nWe also will likely rely on collaborators for the development and potential commercialization of drug candidates we discover internally when we believe it will help maximize the commercial value of the drug candidate. Such collaborators may not achieve the research, development, regulatory and sales milestones for those development candidates that result in material payments to us.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover drug candidates and may fail to capitalize on programs, collaborations, or drug candidates that may present a greater commercial opportunity or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nResearch programs to identify new drug candidates require substantial technical, financial human resources, and external expertise. As a newly formed organization of existing technologies, we have not yet developed any drug candidates, and we may fail to identify potential drug candidates for clinical development. Similarly, a key element of our business plan is to expand the use of our technology in drug discovery collaborations with third parties. A failure to demonstrate the utility of our platform by successfully using it ourselves to discover internal drug candidates could harm our business prospects.\nBecause we have limited resources, we focus our research programs on diseases where we have some know-how and where we believe there is a meaningful commercial opportunity, among other factors. The focus of our initial internal drug discovery programs is in the area of neurological disorders including Rett Syndrome, CDLK5 Deficiency Disorder, and Parkinson\u2019s Disease. We may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs, collaborations, or drug candidates or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. However, the development of any drug candidate we pursue may ultimately prove to be unsuccessful or less successful than another potential drug candidate that we might have chosen to pursue on a more aggressive basis with our capital resources. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential for a particular drug candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that drug candidate through strategic collaboration, partnership, licensing, or other arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain development and commercialization rights to such drug candidate. Alternatively, we may allocate internal resources to a drug candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a collaboration.\nIf we are not able to establish or maintain collaborations to develop and commercialize any of the disease models we develop or drug candidates we discover, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans for those disease models and drug candidates and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have not yet established license collaborations for our disease models and related AnalytiX tools. We expect to rely on future collaborators for either the development of our disease models or leverage such licensed models for drug discovery. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators for these activities, and a number of more established companies may also be pursuing such collaborations.\nWe have also not yet identified any drug candidates or advanced any of our drug discovery programs past the discovery stage and into preclinical studies or human clinical trials. We expect to rely on future collaborators for the development and potential commercialization of drug candidates we discover internally when we believe it will help maximize the commercial value of the drug candidate. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators for these activities, and a number of more established companies may also be pursuing such collaborations. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, financial resources, and greater clinical development and commercialization expertise. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for such collaborations will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration, and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject drug candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such drug candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative drug candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our drug candidate. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large biopharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nIf we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a drug candidate, reduce, or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop any drug candidates or bring them to market.\nOur drug discovery collaborators will have significant discretion in determining when to make announcements, if any, about the status of our collaborations, including about clinical developments and timelines for advancing collaborative programs, and the price of our common stock may decline as a result of announcements of unexpected results or developments.\nOur drug discovery collaborators will have significant discretion in determining when to make announcements about the status of our collaborations, including about preclinical and clinical developments and timelines for advancing the collaborative programs. While as a general matter we intend to periodically report on the status of our collaborations, our drug discovery collaborators may wish to report such information more or less frequently than we intend to or may not wish to report such information at all unless legally required to do so. The price of our common stock may decline as a result of the public announcement of unexpected results or developments in our collaborations or as a result of our collaborators withholding such information.\nIf any current or future collaborators are unable to successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize any drug candidates, or experience delays in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.\nThe success of any current or future collaborators\u2019 development and commercialization programs will depend on several factors associated with our collaborators\u2019 operations, including the following:\n\u25cf acceptable data based on in vitro or in silico screenings;\n\u25cf acceptable data at the completion of necessary preclinical studies to enable the initiation of clinical trials;\n\u25cf successful enrollment of patients in, and the completion of, the clinical trials;\n\u25cf acceptance by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of regulatory filings for any drug candidates we and our current or future collaborators may develop;\n\u25cf expanding and maintaining a workforce of experienced scientists and others to continue to develop any drug candidates;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for any drug candidates we and our current or future collaborators may develop;\n\u25cf making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishing, clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities;\n\u25cf establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for drug products and successfully launching commercial sales, if and when approved;\n\u25cf acceptance of any drug candidates we and our current or future collaborators may develop, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;\n\u25cf effectively competing with other therapies;\n\u25cf obtaining and maintaining coverage, adequate pricing, and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors;\n\u25cf patients\u2019 willingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; or\n\u25cf maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile following receipt of any regulatory approvals.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, including clinical outcomes, the regulatory review process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights, and the manufacturing, marketing, and sales efforts of any current or future collaborator. Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. If we or our current or future collaborators are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for, and successfully commercialize any drug candidates, or if we or they experience delays as a result of any of these factors or otherwise, we may need to spend significant additional time and resources, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe use of any of our drug candidates in clinical trials may expose us to liability claims, which may cost us significant amounts of money to defend against or pay out, causing our business to suffer.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of our drug candidates. If any of our drug candidates enter clinical trials or become marketed products, they could potentially harm people or allegedly harm people possibly subjecting us to costly and damaging product liability claims. Some of the patients who participate in clinical trials are already ill when they enter a trial or may intentionally or unintentionally fail to meet the exclusion criteria. The waivers we obtain may not be enforceable and may not protect us from liability or the costs of product liability litigation. Although we intend to obtain product liability insurance that we believe is adequate, we are subject to the risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to cover claims. The insurance costs along with the defense or payment of liabilities above the amount of coverage could cost us significant amounts of money and management distraction from other elements of the business, causing our business to suffer.\nClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement, and have traditionally had high attrition.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for the sale of our drug candidates, we or our collaborators must complete preclinical development and extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates. We currently plan to design, fund and operate Phase 1 clinical trials and the license our drug candidates and rely on our collaboration partners to undertake future clinical trial funding and related activities. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. We and our collaborators may experience delays in their clinical trials and it is unknown whether clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u25cf we and our collaboration partner\u2019s funding and operational execution;\n\u25cf regulatory requirements for prolonged in vivo dosing regimens due to proposed treatment protocols;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities requiring additional preclinical assessment of the candidate or disagreeing as to the design or implementation of clinical studies;\n\u25cf obtaining regulatory authorizations to commence a trial or consensus with regulatory authorities on trial designs;\n\u25cf reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources to combat epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site, or independent ethics committee, or IEC, approval at any sites outside the United States;\n\u25cf dependence on the needs and timing of third-party collaborators;\n\u25cf changes to clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial in a timely manner and in sufficient numbers;\n\u25cf clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u25cf addressing patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u25cf having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory authorities, including as a result of unforeseen safety issues or side effects or failure of trial sites to adhere to regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf the occurrence of serious adverse events in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other companies or institutions;\n\u25cf subjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indications for which we are developing our drug candidates, or participating in competing trials;\n\u25cf adding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf manufacturing sufficient quantities of a drug candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u25cf challenges in transporting the drug candidate to investigation sites;\n\u25cf lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial;\n\u25cf selection of clinical end points that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;\n\u25cf failure to meet deadlines for annual reports or untimely review of reports by regulators;\n\u25cf a facility manufacturing our drug candidates or any of their components being ordered by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations or other applicable requirements, or infections or cross-contaminations of drug candidates in the manufacturing process;\n\u25cf any changes to the manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u25cf third-party clinical investigators losing the licenses or permits necessary to perform the clinical trials, not performing clinical trials on anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practice, or GCP, or other regulatory requirements; or\n\u25cf third-party contractors not performing data collection or analysis in a timely or accurate manner; or third-party contractors providing poor quality data that requires extensive cleansing; or third-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements or of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act while conducting non-US trials, in which case we or our collaborators may need to find a substitute contractor, and we or our collaborators may not be able to use some or all of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications.\nIn addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises may increase the likelihood that our collaborators encounter such difficulties or delays in initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing clinical trials or research and development. Our collaborators could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by them, by the IRBs (or IECs) of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. Furthermore, our collaborators may rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of clinical trials and, while there may be agreements governing these activities, our collaborators would have limited influence over their actual performance.\nFurther, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries, as our collaborators may do for our current and future drug candidates, presents additional risks that may delay completion of clinical trials. These risks include the failure of enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, failure to account for foreign currency exchange rates in budgeting and financial considerations, customs and trade practices in the shipment of drug substances, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries.\nIf we or our collaborators experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our drug candidates, the commercial prospects of our drug candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product and/or license revenue from any of these drug candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing clinical trials will increase our collaborators\u2019 costs, slow down our drug candidate development and approval process and jeopardize the ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our drug candidates.\nWe and our collaborators will depend on enrollment of patients in their clinical trials in order to continue development of our drug candidates. If they are unable to enroll patients in those clinical trials, our and their research and development efforts could be adversely affected.\nThe timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our collaborators\u2019 ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. Our collaborators may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in their clinical trials for a variety of reasons. Patient enrollment is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints, the proximity of patients to study sites, our collaborators\u2019 ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience, our collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain patient consents, the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion, and competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Our collaborators\u2019 ability to enroll patients in clinical trials may be impacted by governmental restrictions and diversion of healthcare resources resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Many pharmaceutical companies may conduct clinical trials in patients with the disease indications that our potential drug products may target. As a result, we and our collaborators may need to compete with them for clinical sites, physicians and the limited number of patients who fulfill the stringent requirements for participation in clinical trials. Also, due to the confidential nature of clinical trials, it is unknown how many of the eligible patients may be enrolled in competing studies and who are consequently not available for our collaborators\u2019 clinical trials. Our Phase 1 clinical trials or our collaborators\u2019 clinical trials may be delayed or terminated due to the inability to enroll enough patients. The delay or inability to meet planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and delay or termination of the trials, which could have a harmful effect on our and our collaborators\u2019 ability to develop products.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming, expensive and inherently challenging, and if we or our collaborators are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates, our business could be significantly limited.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. It is common for companies in the biopharmaceutical industry to suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to nonclinical findings made while clinical studies were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical studies, including previously unreported adverse events. Our collaborators\u2019 future clinical trial results may not be successful, and notwithstanding any potential promising results in earlier studies, we cannot be certain that we and our collaborators\u2019 will not face similar setbacks. The historical failure rate for drug candidates in our industry is high. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a drug candidate\u2019s clinical development, is subject to individual or review panel interpretation, and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any drug candidate and it is possible that none of our existing drug candidates or any drug candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur drug candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our collaborators\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u25cf we or our collaborators\u2019 may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a drug candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u25cf the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our or our collaborators\u2019 interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf the data collected from clinical trials of our drug candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an New Drug Application (NDA), or Biologics License Application (BLA), or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere; the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree that changes to branded reference drugs meet the criteria for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway or foreign regulatory pathways such as the hybrid medicinal product pathway;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our or our collaborators failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our drug candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our potential drug candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, may approve a drug candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that drug candidate, may classify our drug candidates in a way that hinders market acceptance, and/or may restrict distribution of our approved drugs. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our potential drug candidates.\nWe have not previously submitted an NDA or BLA to the FDA or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any drug candidate, and we cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, our drug candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our drug candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our drug candidates, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patients that we or our collaborators are targeting for our drug candidates are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, if approved.\nWe may plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our drug candidates in the United States, the European Union, and in additional foreign countries. While the scope of regulatory approval is similar in other countries, to obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our drug candidates, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions.\nOur success depends upon achieving a critical mass of customers and strategic relationships.\nOur success is dependent upon achieving significant market acceptance and strategic relationships. To date, we have achieved only limited market acceptance and formed only limited strategic relationships. We do not know whether we will be able to create all the customer and strategic relationships necessary to make our business model function.\nThe degree of market acceptance and adoption of our products will depend on a number of factors, including cost, potential efficacy and potential advantages over alternatives, ease of use and quality, the strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products and services, publicity concerning our products and services or competing products and services or the standards of our competitors who are trying to improve on their own stem cell development technologies. Another risk of adoption is changes in the allocated spending by these companies as our products come online, which is unpredictable and could hurt our business. Other changes in the healthcare landscape, including current treatments and reimbursements, will impact interest in adopting our technology.\nEven if a product or service displays a favorable efficacy in development, market acceptance of the product or service will not be known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community on the benefits of our products and services may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by the conventional technologies marketed by our competitors, particularly due to the novelty of our approach. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable.\nAny investigation of our customers could damage our business.\nFrom time to time, one or more of our customers may be audited or investigated by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies with respect to regulatory compliance of their clinical trials, programs or the marketing and sale of their drugs. There is a risk that either our customers or regulatory authorities could claim that we performed services improperly or that we are responsible for clinical trial or program compliance. If our customers or regulatory authorities make such claims against us and prove them, we could be subject to damages, fines or penalties. In addition, negative publicity regarding regulatory compliance of customers\u2019 clinical trials, programs or drugs could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe may acquire other businesses or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm operating results, dilute its stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue other mergers or acquisitions of businesses and assets. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into existing business, and could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing existing business. We may experience losses related to investments in other companies, which could have a material negative effect on the results of operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture.\nTo finance any mergers or acquisitions, we may choose to issue shares of common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of its stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies using stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nIf our laboratory facilities become damaged or inoperable, or we are required to vacate any facility, the ability to provide services may be jeopardized.\nWe currently derive substantially all revenue from preclinical services. Our facilities and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including fire, flooding and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform tests or provide laboratory services for some period of time. The inability to perform services or the backlog of projects that could develop if any of our facilities is inoperable for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation or relationships with key researchers, collaborators, and customers, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the future. Furthermore, our facilities and the equipment used to perform research and development work could be costly and time-consuming to repair or replace.\nIf we use biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur activities currently require the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials and hazardous materials and chemicals. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject to, on an ongoing basis, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the event of an accident or if we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could lose permits or approvals or be held liable for damages or penalized with fines.\nCyber-attacks or other failures in telecommunications or information technology systems could result in information theft, data corruption and significant disruption of our business operations.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant aspects of operations. These information technology and telecommunications systems support a variety of functions, including test processing, sample tracking, quality control, customer service and support, billing, and general and administrative activities. Information technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. In May of 2019, an unknown individual gained unauthorized access to the then StemoniX chief executive officer\u2019s email account and fraudulently sent an email instructing an employee to wire company funds to a bank account. As a result of this breach, we suffered financial loss of $109,000. In response, StemoniX implemented additional information technology security precautions, including enhanced e-mail security software, employee training, verbal acknowledgement of requests for payment and dual authorization payment controls at a new bank, as well as hired our current Chief Financial Officer. However, we can provide no assurances that a cyber-attack or security breach will not occur again. If we are subjected to one or more cyber-attacks or security breaches, we would suffer additional financial loss. Furthermore, as use of digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, have increased in frequency and sophistication and make us even more at risk. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, the confidentiality and the availability and integrity of our data. Any disruption or loss of information technology or telecommunications systems on which critical aspects of our operations depend could have an adverse effect on business.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our assets.\nWe assess the realizable condition of goodwill annually and conducts an interim evaluation of these assets as well as amortizing indefinite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset, indicate that these assets may be impaired. In connection with the Merger and in accordance with US GAAP, we recorded $9.5 million of amortizing intangible assets and $22.0 million of goodwill based on the fair value of the Cancer Genetic\u2019s outstanding common stock, stock options and warrants on the day of the Merger. All of the amortizing intangible assets and goodwill were allocated to the vivoPharm business. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we commenced a process to sell our vivoPharm business and reclassified its operations as discontinuing operations. Upon this change in classification, we recorded an impairment charge of $20.2 million to reflect the estimated net proceeds from the sale of this business. Our ability to realize the carrying value of the vivoPharm business recorded as of December 31, 2021 will depend on the future cash flows from the sale of the vivoPharm business. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. Such impairment charges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business model and technology are evolving and unproven.\nOur historic StemoniX business model is relatively new, unproven, and likely to continue to evolve. Accordingly, our business model may not be successful, and it may need to be changed. Our ability to generate significant revenue will depend, in large part, on its ability to successfully market its products. We intend to continue to develop our business model as the market for our products and services continues to evolve.\nIn addition, the technology our business model depends on is rapidly changing. Our current model is based on current knowledge and technologies in stem cell sciences, which change frequently. These changes may soon cause our current model to be less relevant, decreasing potential business revenue.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials as well as known and novel therapeutic drug candidates. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources.\nWe also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFuture governmental regulation or lack of regulatory approvals of the industry could affect our business.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals are continuously under consideration by federal, state, local, and foreign governmental organizations, and it is possible that laws or regulations may exist or may be adopted with respect to our industry. The adoption of any such laws or regulations may decrease the growth in the use of our products, our ability to attract and retain personnel, increase our cost of doing business, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. Regulatory changes or failure to comply with existing regulations could adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations. We may need to obtain regulatory approvals in the use of stem cells and our other technologies and may not receive these approvals. We also may not receive approvals for our potential therapeutic applications. We would be unable to act without approval, as that would be a regulatory violation and expose the business to significant liability.\nWe are exposed to the risks of natural and man-made catastrophes, pandemics and malicious and terrorist acts that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural and man-made catastrophes, pandemics, and malicious and terrorist acts present risks that could materially adversely affect our results of operations. While we have taken steps to identify and mitigate these risks, such risks cannot be predicted, nor fully protected against even if anticipated. In addition, such events could result in overall macroeconomic volatility or specifically a decrease or halt in economic activity in large geographic areas, adversely affecting the marketing or operation of our business within such geographic areas or the general economic climate, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nIn particular, the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, has significantly and negatively impacted financial markets and economic conditions in the United States and globally. As a result, our operations have been, and may be further, negatively impacted. Consequently, our business, financial condition and results of operations has been, and could be further, significantly and adversely affected.\nOur ability to obtain compounds used for drug discovery and development could be affected as a result of the tensions between Ukraine and Russia.\nCertain of our collaborators purchase a significant portion of their supply of systemized compounds used for drug discovery and development from a supplier headquartered in Ukraine. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia have escalated in recent months, culminating in Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine. Continued escalation of political tensions, economic instability, military activity or civil hostilities in Ukraine could disrupt our ability to obtain these compounds on a timely basis or at all. If we and our collaborators are unable to continue to obtain supplies from Ukraine or secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our developmental efforts could be delayed and our costs increased, and our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to vivoPharm\nWe may not be able to sell the vivoPharm business and/or any sales we consummate may not produce the desired results.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we committed to a plan to sell the vivoPharm business as we believe it is in the best interest of our stockholders. As a result, the vivoPharm business been classified as discontinuing operations in the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2021, our net assets held for sale totaled $9.4 million, excluding cash. See Note 3 - Discontinuing Operations to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nWe can provide no assurances that we will successfully sell the vivoPharm business, that we will do so in accordance with our expected timeline or that we will recover the carrying value of the assets. Additionally, any decisions made regarding our deployment or use of any sales proceeds we receive in any sale involves risks and uncertainties. As a result, our decisions with respect to such proceeds may not lead to increased long-term stockholder value, or may result in a material charge to our statement of operations.\nA number of factors will impact the sales price of the vivoPharm business which are outside our control, therefore, there can be no assurance that the vivoPharm business can be sold for a price that in our opinion reflects its fair value. If a sale of the vivoPharm business at what we consider to be a reasonable price is not available, we may decide to cease efforts to sell the vivoPharm business and would be required to again reflect the vivoPharm business as part of our continuing operations for financial accounting and reporting purposes. Such a change would also require us to restate our financial statements retroactively for all reportable periods, which would change the information being reported herein. Because vivoPharm incurred an operating loss for fiscal 2021, such a change would negatively affect our fiscal 2021 results from continuing operations.\nOur discovery services customers face intense competition from lower cost generic products, which may lower the amount that they spend on our services.\nOur discovery service customers face increasing competition from lower cost generic products, which in turn may affect their ability to pursue research and development activities with us. In the United States, EU and Japan, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures which encourages the use of generic products. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time in the United States and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. Loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing customers\u2019 sales of that product and their overall profitability. Availability of generic substitutes for our customers\u2019 drugs may adversely affect their results of operations and cash flow, which in turn may mean that they would not have surplus capital to invest in research and development and drug commercialization, including in our services. If competition from generic products impacts customers\u2019 finances such that they decide to curtail our services, revenue may decline and this could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe potential loss or delay of our large contracts or of multiple contracts could adversely affect results.\nMost of our discovery services customers can terminate the contracts upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. These customers may delay, terminate or reduce the scope of the contracts for a variety of reasons beyond our control, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf decisions to forego or terminate a particular clinical trial;\n\u25cf lack of available financing, budgetary limits or changing priorities;\n\u25cf failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria;\n\u25cf unexpected or undesired clinical results for products; or\n\u25cf shift of business to a competitor or internal resources.\nAs a result, contract terminations, delays and alterations are a possible outcome in our discovery services business. In the event of termination, the contracts often provide for fees for winding down the project, but these fees may not be sufficient for us to maintain margins, and termination may result in lower resource utilization rates. In addition, we may not realize the full benefits of the backlog of contractually committed services if customers cancel, delay or reduce their commitments under our contracts with them, which may occur if, among other things, a customer decides to shift its business to a competitor or revoke our status as a preferred provider. Thus, the loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. We believe the risk of loss or delay of multiple contracts potentially has greater effect where we are party to broader partnering arrangements with global biopharmaceutical companies.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected if we underprice contracts, overruns cost estimates or fails to receive approval for or experience delays in documenting change orders.\nMost of the discovery services contracts are either fee for service contracts or fixed-fee contracts. Our past financial results have been, and future financial results may be, adversely impacted if we initially underprice contracts or otherwise overrun cost estimates and is unable to successfully negotiate a change order. Change orders can occur when the scope of work we perform need to be modified from that originally contemplated by the contract with the customer and are typically treated as new projects. Modifications can occur, for example, when there is a change in a key clinical trial assumption or parameter or a significant change in timing. Where we are not successful in converting out-of-scope work into change orders under current contracts, we bear the cost of the additional work. Such underpricing, significant cost overruns or delay in documentation of change orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIf we fail to perform the services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed.\nIn connection with the discovery services business, we contract with biopharmaceutical companies to provide specialized services to assist them in planning and conducting unique, specialized studies to guide drug discovery and development programs with a concentration in oncology and immuno-oncology. Our services include managing pre-clinical trials, data and laboratory analysis, electronic data capture and other related services. Such services are complex and subject to contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations. If we fail to perform the services in accordance with these requirements, regulatory agencies may take action against us for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials. Customers may also bring claims against us for breach of contractual obligations. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nThe performance of clinical development services is complex and time-consuming. For example, we may make mistakes in conducting a clinical trial that could negatively impact or obviate the usefulness of the clinical trial or cause the results of the clinical trial to be reported improperly. If the clinical trial results are compromised, we could be subject to significant costs or liability, which could have an adverse impact on the ability to perform services. As examples:\n\u25cf non-compliance generally could result in the termination of ongoing clinical trials or sales and marketing projects or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf compromise of data from a particular clinical trial, such as failure to verify that informed consent was obtained from patients, could require us to repeat the clinical trial under the terms of the contract at no further cost to the customer, but at a substantial cost to us; and\n\u25cf breach of a contractual term could result in liability for damages or termination of the contract.\nWhile we endeavor to contractually limit exposure to such risks, improper performance of our services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, damage reputation and result in the cancellation of current contracts by or failure to obtain future contracts from the affected customer or other customers.\nIn our preclinical CRO business unit doing early-stage discovery work we conduct testing on animals, which could subject us to disruptions by animal rights activists, and we are subject to laws and standards dealing with animal testing, each of which could affect our business negatively.\nOur Pennsylvania and Australia research laboratory facilities comply with Good Laboratory Practices (\u201cGLP\u201d) to the extent required by the FDA, Environmental Protection Agency, USDA, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), as well as other international regulatory agencies. Furthermore, our early-stage discovery work, which is not subject to GLP standards, is typically carried out under a quality management system or internally developed quality systems. Our facilities are regularly inspected by U.S. and other regulatory compliance monitoring authorities, its clients\u2019 quality assurance departments, and its own internal quality assessment program. We are also accredited by American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (\u201cAAALAC\u201d) International, a private, nonprofit organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs. We volunteer to participate in the AAALAC\u2019s program to demonstrate its commitment to responsible animal care and use, in addition to its compliance with local, state and federal laws that regulate animal research.\nAnimal rights group, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (\u201cPETA\u201d) have in the past targeted scientific research, which, if targeted at us or our customers, could affect our business.\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nOur business strategy incorporates international expansion, including recent acquisitions which have provided facilities in Australia, and the possibility of establishing and maintaining other locations outside of the United States and expanding relationships with biopharmaceutical, academic and governmental research organizations. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax and transfer pricing laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u25cf being subject to additional privacy and cybersecurity laws, including the Australian Privacy Act of 1988;\n\u25cf failure by us or our distributors to obtain regulatory approvals for the sale or use of tests in various countries, including failure to achieve \u201cCE Marking\u201d, a conformity mark which is required to market in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the European Economic Area and which is broadly accepted in other international markets;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and\n\u25cf failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 activities.\nAny of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm future international expansion and operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on the deployment of cash across global operations.\nAlthough we report operating results in U.S. dollars, a portion of our revenue and expenses are or will be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly in Australia and Europe. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a number of adverse effects on the Company. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenue, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect revenue, income from operations, other income (expense), net and the value of consolidated balance sheet items originally denominated in other currencies. There is no guarantee that our financial results will not be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, in some countries we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which could limit our ability to use these funds across its global operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe FCPA and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties, including criminal and civil fines, potential loss of export licenses, possible suspension of the ability to do business with the federal government, denial of government reimbursement for products and exclusion from participation in government health care programs. We may operate in jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. We cannot assure that the internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by affiliates, employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe expect that we will rely on third parties to assist us and our collaborators in conducting clinical trials for our drug candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our drug candidates and our business would be substantially harmed.\nWe expect that we and our collaborators will enter into agreements with third-party CROs to assist our collaborators in conducting and managing their clinical programs, including contracting with clinical sites to perform clinical studies. We and our collaborators may rely on these parties for execution of clinical studies for our drug candidates, and they would control only certain aspects of conducting the clinical studies. Nevertheless, our collaborators will be responsible for ensuring that each of their studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and their reliance on CROs and clinical sites will not relieve them of their regulatory responsibilities. Such CROs will be required to comply with current Good Clinical Practices regulations, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any products in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCP regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If our collaborators or their CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require our collaborators to perform additional clinical trials before approving their marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of the clinical trials comply with cGCPs. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP regulations and will require a large number of test subjects. The failure of us, our collaborators, CROs or clinical sites to comply with these regulations may require them to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject them to enforcement action up to and including civil and criminal penalties.\nAlthough we expect our collaborators to design the clinical trials for our drug candidates in consultation with CROs, we expect that the CROs will manage and assist our collaborators with the clinical trials conducted at contracted clinical sites. As a result, many important aspects of our drug development programs would be outside of our collaborators\u2019 direct control. In addition, the CROs and clinical sites may not perform all of their obligations under arrangements with us or our collaborators or in compliance with regulatory requirements. If the CROs or clinical sites do not perform clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, or if they breach their obligations to our collaborators or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, the development and commercialization of our drug candidates for the subject indications may be delayed or our development program materially and irreversibly harmed. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources these CROs and clinical sites will devote to our program or our drug candidates. If our collaborators are unable to rely on clinical data collected by CROs through the clinical research sites, our collaborators could be required to repeat, extend the duration of, or increase the size of clinical trials, which could significantly delay commercialization and require significantly greater expenditures.\nIf any of our collaborators\u2019 relationships with these third-party CROs or clinical sites terminate, our collaborators may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or clinical sites. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, any such clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our drug candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nWe expect that we will rely on third parties to assist us and our collaborators in formulation and manufacture of our drug candidates and approved drugs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates or commercialize approved drugs and our business would be substantially harmed.\nWe do not currently, nor do we expect in the future to, have expertise in the formulation and manufacturing of drug candidates for use in clinical trials or commercial drug products. As such, we expect to engage a contract manufacturing organization (CMO) for the formulation, production, packaging, and distribution of high-quality drug products in sufficient quantities for clinical trials and market entry. These products must meet FDA and other regulatory authority standards for quality, strength, and potency. Regulatory authorities require submission of manufacturing specification in the investigational new drug application (IND), which must adhere to quality standards and be manufactured according to guidance on cGMP.\nThe CMO is reliant on the availability of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the production of the specified dosage form for the clinical trial as well as subsequent manufacturing requirements for the marketed drug. The CMO may manufacture the API in-house or contract with a third-party chemical manufacturer to supply the API in sufficient quantity. If the CMO or the third-party API supplier are not able to produce the API or drug product because of scarcity of raw materials, manufacturing equipment malfunction, manufacturing facility inoperability or damage, disruption of shipping or transport logistics, or other unplanned for complications the approval of the IND will be delayed until a replacement CMO can be secured. Likewise, disruptions to the production of the dosage form for marketed drug manufacture will delay the final approval of the NDA or BLA or will affect our ability to enter the market. If the CMO fails to meet quality standards in the manufacture of the drug product for any reason, significant delays in the availability of the product will adversely affect the availability of the marketed product.\nWe require third-party relationships that may not provide needed services. If such collaborators or partners fail to perform as expected the potential for us to generate future revenue from our technologies and products and services would be significantly reduced and our business would be harmed.\nMany aspects of our business require third-party relationships, including but not limited to equipment, materials, technology, knowledge, sales, business development and distribution. We also utilize a number of banking, payroll, enterprise software and computer applications, and data storage that relay upon third-party vendors and cloud-based applications.\nSpecific and unique material needs are human cells and co-factors to support the growth and development of those cells. These partners may not allocate the resources, including time and capital, necessary to supply whatever is needed for our business. This and other issues may require termination or conflict with partners that our business model depends upon. We have been sourcing a number of our lab supplies from alternative suppliers due to product availability from our normal suppliers. For our StemoniX business, 384 well plates used to grow microOrgans are in scarce supply to due to product availability and a lack of alternative suppliers.\nOur current and any future partnerships are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf partners have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the partnerships;\n\u25cf partners may not perform their obligations as expected or fail to fulfill their responsibilities in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf we may not have access to, or may be restricted from disclosing, certain information regarding products or services being developed or commercialized under a partnership and, consequently, may have limited ability to inform our shareholders about the status of such developments;\n\u25cf partners could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with ours if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u25cf products or services developed with partners may be viewed by our partners as competitive with their own products or services, which may cause partners to stop work on our behalf; or\n\u25cf partners may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation.\nIn addition, certain partnership agreements provide our partners with rights to terminate such agreements, which rights may or may not be subject to conditions, and which rights, if exercised, could adversely affect our product development efforts and could make it difficult for us to attract new partners. In that event: we would likely be required to limit the size and scope of efforts for the development and commercialization; we would likely be required to seek additional financing to fund further development or identify alternative strategic collaborations; our potential to generate future revenue from royalties and milestone payments would be significantly reduced, delayed or eliminated; and it could have an adverse effect on our business and future growth prospects.\nIf conflicts arise with our partners, collaborators or licensors, they may act in their own self-interest, which may be adverse to the interests of our Company.\nWe may in the future experience disagreements with our partners, collaborators or licensors. Conflicts may arise in our collaboration and license arrangements with third parties due to one or more of the following:\n\u25cf disputes with respect to milestone or payments that are believed due under the applicable agreements;\n\u25cf disagreements with respect to the ownership of intellectual property rights or scope of licenses;\n\u25cf disagreements with respect to the scope of any obligations;\n\u25cf unwillingness on the part of a partner or collaborator to keep us informed regarding the progress of its activities; and\n\u25cf disputes with respect to our efforts with respect to the agreement with a partner or collaborator.\nConflicts with our partners, collaborators or licensors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and future growth prospects.\nA partner may choose to violate confidentiality agreements or use knowledge of our business operations to compete, decreasing our potential collaborators and increasing competition, which could lead to a loss of business revenue.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we collaborate with various organizations and academic institutions, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, such as trade secrets.\nDespite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\nIntellectual Property Risks Relating to Our Business\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our products and processes, or if the scope of the patent and other intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and processes. We rely on know-how, patents, trade secrets, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights.\nThrough our StemoniX subsidiary, we currently have twenty patent applications pending in the United States. The main risks related to these patent applications is that the underlying patents will not be issued, or if they are issued, that the technology will still be used or challenged by competitors. If the patents are issued and need to be defended from lawsuits, such defense would require significant time and financial costs, and there is the risk of losing the challenge. In addition, we may not be issued similar patent rights throughout the world. These risks apply to any of our trademarks as well. Furthermore, competitors may allege that our business infringes on their intellectual property. If challenged, there will be legal costs and the risk of loss, even if such allegations are false.\nMoreover, the patent application and approval process is expensive and time-consuming. We may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Furthermore, we, or any future partners, collaborators, or licensees, may fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, we may miss potential opportunities to seek additional patent protection. If we fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If there are material defects in the form, preparation, prosecution or enforcement of our patents or patent applications, such patents may be invalid and/or unenforceable, and such applications may never result in valid, enforceable patents.\nEven if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications, if issued, may not provide us with any meaningful protection or prevent competitors from designing around our patent claims by developing similar or alternative technologies in a non-infringing manner. For example, a third party may develop a competitive technology that is similar to ours, but that falls outside the scope of our patent protection. If the patent protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold or pursue is not sufficiently broad to impede such competition, our ability to successfully commercialize our technology could be negatively affected.\nIn addition to patent protection, we expect to rely heavily on trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented technology, which are difficult to protect. Although we seek such protection in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our vendors, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information, we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, adequate remedies for any breach would be available, or our trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or be independently developed by our competitors. If we are unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property rights, sales of our products may suffer and our ability to generate revenue could be severely impacted.\nOur rights to use technologies licensed from third parties are not within our control and may we lose existing rights or may not be able to obtain new rights on reasonable terms.\nWe are heavily dependent on licensed in technology in order to operate our business. We license multiple patents and protocols from the University of California, San Diego, as well as from (1) Academia Japan for technology that we need in order to create and sell induced pluripotent stem cells, (2) ID Pharma for the Sendai virus vector technology, and (3) the Max Plank Innovation GmbH for mid-brain organoid production. None of these licenses are exclusive. In addition, we may need to obtain additional licenses that are also non-exclusive. The lack of exclusivity could decrease the barriers of entry for potential competitors. Additionally, if one or more of our license agreements terminates, we may not be able to enter into new license agreements for comparable technology or on comparable terms.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our marks of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We rely on both registration and common law protection for our trademarks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we would be given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce patents or other intellectual property rights, which could be time-consuming and costly to defend, and could result in loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.\nFrom time to time we may face intellectual property infringement (or misappropriation) claims from third parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome of any such litigation can never be guaranteed, and an adverse outcome could affect us negatively. For example, were a third-party to succeed on an infringement claim against the us, we may be required to pay substantial damages (including up to treble damages if such infringement were found to be willful). In addition, we could face an injunction, barring us from conducting the allegedly infringing activity. The outcome of the litigation could require us to enter into a license agreement which may not be pursuant to acceptable or commercially reasonable or practical terms or which may not be available at all. It is also possible that an adverse finding of infringement against us may require us to dedicate substantial resources and time in developing non-infringing alternatives, which may or may not be possible. In the case of diagnostic tests, we would also need to include non-infringing technologies which would require us to re-validate tests. Any such re-validation, in addition to being costly and time consuming, may be unsuccessful.\nFurthermore, we may initiate claims to assert or defend intellectual property against third parties. Any intellectual property litigation, irrespective of whether we are the plaintiff or the defendant, and regardless of the outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and negatively affect operating results or financial condition. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with third-party collaborators or suppliers, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, interference proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to patents and patent applications or those of our current or future collaborators, suppliers or customers.\nFinally, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential and proprietary information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our current and former employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at universities or at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including some which may be competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees may be subject to proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non- competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, which may result in claims by or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our senior management and scientific personnel.\nIssued patents covering our technology or products could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or in administrative proceedings. We may not be able to protect our trade secrets in court.\nIf we initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent, should such a patent issue, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, written description or non- enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld information material to patentability from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties also may raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. An adverse determination could result in the revocation or cancellation of, or amendment to, our patents. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Competitors and other third parties could attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If our trade secrets are not adequately protected or sufficient to provide an advantage over our competitors, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating our trade secrets.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of the patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in the patents and intellectual property that we own or that we may own or license in the future. While it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own or such assignments may not be self-executing or may be breached. We could be subject to ownership disputes arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of employees or consultants. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we or fail in defending any such claims, we may have to pay monetary damages and may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any future intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe may enter into license agreements in the future. We expect that such license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these licenses, our licensors may have the right to terminate these license agreements. Termination of these license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may also result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension and exclusivity, our business may be materially harmed.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our proprietary technology are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patents in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States could be less extensive than those in the United States. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing countries; thus, even in countries where we do pursue patent protection, there can be no assurance that any patents will issue. There can be no assurance that we will obtain or maintain patent rights in or outside the United States under any future license agreements. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in countries outside the United States, even in jurisdictions where we pursue patent protection, or from selling or importing technologies or products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not pursued and obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These competitors may compete with us, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nWe only have a limited number of employees to manage and operate our business.\nAs of March 15, we had 34 employees in our continuing operations and 38 employees in our vivoPharm business. Our focus on the development of our drug candidates and disease models requires us to optimize cash utilization and to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to hire or retain adequate staffing levels to develop our technology or run our operations or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.\nThere is a scarcity of experienced professionals in our industry. If we are not able to retain and recruit personnel with the requisite technical skills, we may be unable to successfully execute the business strategy.\nThe specialized nature of our industry results in an inherent scarcity of experienced personnel in the field. Our future success depends upon the ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel (including medical, scientific, technical, commercial, business, regulatory and administrative personnel) necessary to support anticipated growth, develop business and perform certain contractual obligations. Given the scarcity of professionals with the scientific knowledge that we require and the competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, we may not succeed in attracting or retaining the personnel required to continue and grow operations. The loss of a key employee, the failure of a key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees could result in the inability to continue to grow our business or to implement business strategy.\nThe loss or transition of any member of our senior management team or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, clinicians and salespeople could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience, and performance of key members of the senior management team. The individual and collective efforts of these employees will be important as we continue to develop tests and services, and as we expand commercial activities. We have experienced increased turnover in the past year and the loss or incapacity of existing members of the senior management team could adversely affect operations if we experience difficulties in hiring qualified successors.\nThe complexity inherent in integrating a new key member of the senior management team with existing senior management may limit the effectiveness of any such successor or otherwise adversely affect our business. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to business or may increase the likelihood of turnover of other key officers and employees. Specifically, a leadership transition in the commercial team may cause uncertainty about or a disruption to our commercial organization, which may impact the ability to achieve sales and revenue targets.\nOur officers and directors have significant influence over critical decisions.\nOur officers and directors have a significant stake in the Company and are likely to have influence over any critical decisions relating to the Company. Our officers and directors beneficially own, directly or indirectly, approximately 10.9% of our outstanding common stock as of March 15, 2022. As a result, such individuals are likely to continue to have a significant influence in determining the outcome of any matter submitted to the shareholders for approval (including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets) and to have significant influence in the management and affairs of the Company. The interests of the officers and directors may differ from the interests of other shareholders due to various factors, which may include the differing price at which they acquired their ownership in the Company as compared to other shareholders, the significant investment of personal time and effort by the officers and directors into the Company, and differing views on the effect of sunk costs with regard to potential future liquidity events.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, collaborators and contract research organizations may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, collaborators and contract research organizations may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by those parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (1) FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities, (2) manufacturing standards, (3) federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, and (4) laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self- dealing, bribery and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee or collaborator misconduct could also involve the improper use of, including trading on, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted and maintained a code of conduct and in connection with the merger, we intend to maintain our code of conduct and business ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to manage growth, our prospects may be limited and our future results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe intend to continue to attempt to expand our business with sales and marketing programs and other activities as needed to meet future demand. Any significant expansion may strain managerial, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage such growth, business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. We will need to improve continually the operations, financial and other internal systems to manage growth effectively, and any failure to do so may lead to inefficiencies and redundancies, and result in reduced growth prospects and diminished operational results.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and could remain volatile, and the market price of common stock may decrease.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. From consummation of the merger of Cancer Genetics and StemoniX on March 30, 2021 through March 15, 2022, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated from a high of $4.81 per share in the second quarter of 2021 to a low of $0.99 in the first quarter of 2022. Market prices for securities of development-stage life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. The factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf progress, or lack of progress, in developing and commercializing our drug discovery candidates;\n\u25cf our ability to recruit and retain qualified regulatory and research and development personnel;\n\u25cf changes in the relationship with key collaborators, suppliers, customers and third parties;\n\u25cf changes in the market valuation or earnings of competitors or companies viewed as similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in key personnel;\n\u25cf depth of the trading market in our common stock;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u25cf the granting or exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards;\n\u25cf realization of any of the risks described under this section titled \u201cRisk Factors;\u201d and\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the equity markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the securities of newly public companies for a number of reasons, including reasons that may be unrelated to business or operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock and you may not be able to sell your shares at prices you deem acceptable. In the past, following periods of volatility in the equity markets, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against public companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management attention.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed actual results, could adversely affect our common stock price and trading volume.\nSecurities research analysts establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if the actual results do not match securities research analysts\u2019 projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who authors reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline. While we expect securities research analyst coverage, if no securities or industry analysts begin to cover us, the trading price for our stock and the trading volume could be adversely affected.\nWe are incurring significant costs and devotes substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses. For example, in addition to being required to comply with certain requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to comply with certain requirements of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. We expect that compliance with these requirements will continue to increase legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that management and other personnel will continue to need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, if we lose status as a \u201cnon-accelerated filer,\u201d we will be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as applicable, requires us to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to continue to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. If we or the independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and maintain compliance with Section 404, as applicable, requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause operations to suffer and we may be unable to conclude that internal control over financial reporting is effective. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for our common stock, and could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current members of the board and management.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of the board of directors. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions, among other things:\n\u25cf authorize the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that the board of directors does not approve;\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to the board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and\n\u25cf limit who may call a stockholder meeting.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on our common stock, from merging or combining with the Company for a prescribed period of time.\nBecause we do not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future, you must rely on appreciation of our common stock price for any return on your investment. Even we change that policy, we may be restricted from paying dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial performance, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors the board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, you will have to rely on capital appreciation, if any, to earn a return on your investment in our common stock. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14094, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "CGIX"}
