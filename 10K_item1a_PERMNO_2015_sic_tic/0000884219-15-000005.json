{"cik": "884219", "company": "VIAD CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nViad\u2019s operating results are subject to known and unknown risks. As a result, past financial performance and historical trends may not be reliable indicators of future performance.\nViad\u2019s future payment of special dividends should not be relied upon as a way to realize any future gains on an investment.\nThe Board of Directors generally declares and pays regular dividends to Viad\u2019s shareholders on a quarterly basis and also has paid special dividends, most recently in February 2014. The decision to declare a special dividend and the amount, timing and payment of any such dividend are at the sole discretion of the Board. Factors in any decision to declare a dividend would include the amount of funds legally available and an evaluation of the Company\u2019s financial condition, capital requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. Accordingly, investors should not rely on the future payment of special dividends as a way to realize gains on their investment.\nViad\u2019s businesses and operating results are adversely affected by deterioration in general economic conditions.\nViad\u2019s businesses are sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions and are impacted by increases and decreases in the cost of materials and operating supplies. Operating results for the Marketing & Events U.S. and International segments depend largely on the number of exhibitions held and on the size of exhibitors\u2019 marketing expenditures, which in turn depend partly on the strength of particular industries in which exhibitors operate. The number and size of exhibitions generally decrease when the economy weakens.\nFurther, many exhibitors\u2019 marketing budgets are partly discretionary, and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced by exhibitors when economic conditions deteriorate, resulting in reduced spending by exhibitors for the Company\u2019s services. Marketing expenditures often are not increased until economic conditions improve. As a result, during periods of general economic weakness, the operating results for the Marketing & Events Group are adversely affected. Similarly, many of the retail shopping mall and lifestyle center clients of the Marketing & Events Group may reduce marketing expenditures when economic conditions deteriorate.\nRevenues from the Travel & Recreation Group businesses depend largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations. This amount decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions.\nViad\u2019s results of operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nViad conducts foreign operations primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, in certain other countries. The functional currency of Viad\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. Accordingly, for purposes of consolidation, Viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of those foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in Viad\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may result in material changes to Viad\u2019s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets. Viad has not hedged its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, for purposes of consolidation, the revenue, expenses and gains and losses related to Viad\u2019s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period. As a result, Viad\u2019s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, even when the functional currency amounts have not changed. Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rates affect overall profitability and historical period-to-period comparisons. Viad has not hedged its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results.\nDuring 2014, the Marketing & Events Group derived approximately 26 percent of its revenue and 33 percent of its segment operating income from its International segment. The Travel & Recreation Group derived approximately 75 percent of its 2014 revenue and 90 percent of its 2014 segment operating income from its Canadian operations. For this segment, Canadian operations are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation, and accordingly, increases in the value of the Canadian dollar as compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes, and, therefore, revenue and segment operating income in the Travel & Recreation Group.\nExhibition rotation impacts overall profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult.\nThe business activities of the Marketing & Events Group are largely dependent upon the frequency, timing and location of exhibitions and events. Some large exhibitions are not held annually (they may be held once every two or three years or longer). Some large exhibitions may be held at a different time of year than when they have historically been held. In addition, the same exhibition may be held in different locations in different years, and may result in Viad generating lower margins in a given period if the exhibition shifts to a higher-cost city.\nAs a consequence of those factors, the operating results for those businesses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, making periodic comparisons difficult.\nViad\u2019s businesses are adversely affected by disruptions in the travel industry, particularly those adversely affecting the hotel and airline industries.\nThe success of Viad\u2019s businesses depends largely on the ability and willingness of people, whether exhibitors, exhibition attendees or others, to travel. Factors adversely affecting the travel industry as a whole, and particularly the airline and hotel industries, generally also adversely affect Viad\u2019s businesses and results of operations. Factors that could adversely affect the travel industry as a whole include high or rising fuel prices, increased security and passport requirements, weather conditions, airline accidents and international political instability and hostilities. Unexpected events of this nature, or other events that may have an impact on the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations, could adversely affect Viad\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nThe failure of a large client to renew its services contract or the loss of business from convention facilities could adversely impact revenue.\nAlthough no single client accounted for more than 6.3 percent of the revenue of any of Viad\u2019s reporting segments in 2014, the Marketing & Events U.S. and International segments have a relatively small number of large exhibition show organizers and large customer accounts. The loss of any of these large clients could adversely affect Viad\u2019s results of operations.\nIn addition, revenue of the Marketing & Events Group may be significantly impacted if certain exhibition facilities choose to in-source electrical, plumbing or other services. When the Marketing & Events Group is hired as the official services contractor for an exhibition, the show organizer contractually grants an exclusive right to perform those electrical and plumbing services, subject in each case to the exhibition facility\u2019s option to in-source the services (either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider). Many exhibition facilities are under financial pressure as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry, including an increased supply of exhibition space. As a result, some of those facilities have sought to in-source all or a large portion of those services. If a large number of facilities with which the Marketing & Events Group has those relationships moves those services in-house, Viad\u2019s revenue and operating results could be adversely affected.\nViad\u2019s key businesses are relationship driven.\nThe business activities of the Marketing & Events U.S. and International segments are heavily focused on client relationships, and, specifically, on the close collaboration and interaction with the client. Those relationships require the account team to become attuned to the client\u2019s desires and expectations in order to provide top-quality service. Viad has in the past lost, and may in the future lose, important clients (and corresponding revenue) if a key member of the account team were to cease employment with the Company and take those customers to a competitor.\nCompleted acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned.\nViad has acquired businesses and intends to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire businesses that complement, enhance or expand Viad\u2019s current businesses or offer growth opportunities to Viad. Any acquisition can involve a number of risks, including the failure to achieve the financial and strategic goals and other benefits from the acquisition; the inability to successfully integrate the acquired business into Viad\u2019s ongoing businesses; the inability to retain key personnel or customers of the acquired business; the inability to successfully integrate financial reporting and internal control systems; increased debt;\nnew regulatory requirements; the disruption of Viad\u2019s ongoing businesses and distraction of senior management and employees of Viad from other opportunities and challenges due to the integration of the acquired business; and the potential existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or known by Viad prior to closing the acquisition or not otherwise provided for through the purchase agreement. If Viad makes changes to its business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect its business operations, the Company may also be required to record an impairment charge to goodwill or intangible assets.\nViad\u2019s businesses are seasonal, which causes results of operations to fluctuate and makes results of operations particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods.\nExhibition and event activity for the U.S. and International segments varies significantly depending on the frequency and timing of shows, as some shows are not held each year and some may shift between quarters. The Travel & Recreation Group businesses are generally also seasonal, experiencing peak activity during the second and third quarters. Those quarters accounted for 85 percent of the segment\u2019s 2014 revenue. Because of the seasonal nature of Viad\u2019s businesses, adverse events or conditions occurring during peak periods could adversely affect the operating results of Viad\u2019s businesses.\nNew capital projects may not be commercially successful.\nFrom time to time, in an effort to seize opportunities that complement, enhance and expand its businesses, Viad pursues new capital projects. Capital projects are subject to a number of risks, including unanticipated delays and cost overruns, failure to achieve established financial and strategic goals and the inability to successfully integrate into Viad\u2019s ongoing businesses, as well as additional risks specific to a project. The occurrence of any of the events described above could prevent a new capital project from performing in accordance with Viad\u2019s commercial expectations and could have a material adverse effect on its businesses and results of operations.\nTransportation disruptions and increases in transportation costs could adversely affect Viad\u2019s businesses and operating results.\nThe Marketing & Events U.S. and International segments rely on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibitions, warehouse facilities and customer facilities. If they were unable to secure the services of those independent transportation carriers at favorable rates, it could have a material adverse effect on these businesses and their results of operations. In addition, disruption of transportation services because of weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts or other events could adversely affect their ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions, which may have a material adverse effect on its businesses and operating results. Similarly, disruption of transportation services could adversely affect the ability of the Marketing & Events Group to supply time-sensitive holiday-themed exhibits and experiences to retail shopping mall and lifestyle center customers and could cause the cancellation of the exhibits and experiences.\nUnion-represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs.\nA significant portion of Viad\u2019s employees are unionized and Viad\u2019s businesses are party to approximately 100 collective-bargaining agreements, with approximately one-third requiring renegotiation each year. If the results of labor negotiations caused the Company to increase wages or benefits, which increases total labor costs, the increased costs could either be absorbed (which would adversely affect operating margins) or passed on to customers, which may lead customers to turn to other vendors in response to higher prices. In either event, Viad\u2019s businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMoreover, if the Company were unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective-bargaining process, the union may strike or carry out other types of work stoppages. In such a circumstance, Viad might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skills to perform many of the services, or may incur additional costs to do so, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nObligations to fund multi-employer pension plans to which Viad contributes may have an adverse impact on operating results.\nViad\u2019s businesses contribute to various multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective-bargaining agreements covering its union-represented employees. Viad\u2019s contributions to those multi-employer plans in 2014 and 2013 totaled $23.2 million and $20.3 million, respectively. Viad does not directly manage those multi-employer plans, which are generally managed by boards of trustees. Based upon the information available to Viad from plan administrators, management believes that several of those multi-employer plans are underfunded. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires pension plans underfunded at certain levels to reduce, over defined time periods, the underfunded status. In addition, under current laws, the termination of a plan, or a voluntary withdrawal from a plan by Viad, or a shrinking contribution base to a plan as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other contributing employers to such plan, would require Viad to make payments to such plan\nfor its proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. Viad cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding, if any, it may be required to make to those plans. However, plan contribution increases, if any, could have an adverse impact on Viad\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nViad competes in competitive industries and increased competition could negatively impact operating results.\nViad is engaged in a number of highly competitive industries. Competition in the exhibition and events industry and the exhibits and experiential environments industries is driven by price and service quality, among other factors. To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain their market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies, Viad may be required to lower its prices and rates to avoid loss of related business, thereby adversely affecting operating results. In addition, if Viad is unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, Viad could lose market share to its competitors. If Viad were unable to meet the challenges presented by the competitive environment, results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLiabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect results of operations.\nViad and its predecessors have a corporate history spanning over eight decades and involving approximately 2,400 previous subsidiaries in diverse businesses, such as the manufacturing of locomotives, buses, industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, leather, textiles, food and fresh meats. Some of those businesses used raw materials that have been, and may continue to be, the subject of litigation. Moreover, some of the raw materials used and the waste produced by those businesses have been and are the subject of U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts. In addition, Viad may incur other liabilities, resulting from indemnification claims involving sold subsidiaries, as well as from past operations of predecessors or their subsidiaries. Although the Company believes it has adequate reserves and sufficient insurance coverage to cover those future liabilities, results of operations could be materially affected if future events or proceedings contradict current assumptions, and reserves or insurance become inadequate.\nTerrorist attacks, natural disasters or other catastrophic events may have a negative effect on Viad\u2019s business\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes and floods), health epidemics or pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, or the prospect of these events could disrupt Viad\u2019s businesses. Such catastrophic events could impact the Marketing & Events Group\u2019s production facilities, preventing the Company from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers, and also could cause a cancellation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues or a disruption in the services the Company provides to its customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels and other public venues. Such catastrophic events also could adversely impact the Travel & Recreation Group businesses, which are heavily dependent on the ability and willingness of its guests to travel. The guests serviced by the Travel & Recreation Group tend to delay or postpone vacations if natural conditions differ from those that typically prevail at competing lodges, resorts and attractions during a given season, and catastrophic events could impede the guests\u2019 ability to travel, interrupt the Company\u2019s business operations and/or cause damage to the Company\u2019s properties. If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, Viad could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition.\nImproper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nViad\u2019s businesses store and process a significant amount of personally identifiable information in connection with the services they provide to customers. If the Company\u2019s security controls over personal data, training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices and procedures do not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, the Company\u2019s reputation could be harmed, and the Company could face legal exposure to customers and other liabilities under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Certain of the Company\u2019s services also enable its customers to store and process personal data. Perceptions that the Company\u2019s services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could adversely affect Viad\u2019s businesses and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 19721, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "VVI"}
