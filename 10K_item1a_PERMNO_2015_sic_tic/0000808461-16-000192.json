{"cik": "808461", "company": "GENERAL COMMUNICATION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFactors That May Affect Our Business and Future Results\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\nThere is substantial competition in the telecommunications and entertainment industries. Through mergers and various service integration strategies, major providers are striving to provide integrated communications services offerings within and across geographic markets. We face increased wireless services competition from national carriers in the Alaska market and increasing video services competition from DBS providers and over-the-top content providers who are often able to offer more flexible subscription packages and exclusive content.\nWe expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products. We cannot predict which of many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors. To the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets, we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income. Competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services. Competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan. We also face the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins.\nOur wholesale customers including our major roaming customers may construct facilities in locations where they contract with us to use our network to provide service on their behalf. We would experience a decline in revenue and net income if any of our wholesale customers constructed or expanded their existing networks in places where service is provided on our network. Some of our wholesale customers have greater access to financial, technical, and other resources than we do. We expect to negotiate long-term contracts with such customers to offer competitive alternatives while retaining significant traffic on our network. We cannot predict whether such negotiations will be successful. Our inability to negotiate such contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor more information about competition by segment, see the sections titled \u201cCompetition\u201d included in \u201cPart 1 - Item 1 - Business - Description of our Business by Reportable Segment.\u201d\nIf we experience low or negative rates of subscriber acquisition or high rates of turnover, our financial performance will be impaired.\nWe are in the business of selling communications and entertainment services to subscribers, and our economic success is based on our ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers. If we are unable to retain and attract subscribers, our financial performance will be impaired. Our rates of subscriber acquisition and turnover are affected by a number of competitive factors including the size of our service areas, network performance and reliability issues, our device and service offerings, subscribers\u2019 perceptions of our services, and customer care quality. Managing these factors and subscribers\u2019 expectations is essential in attracting and retaining subscribers. Although we have implemented programs to attract new subscribers and address subscriber turnover, we cannot assure you that these programs or our strategies to address subscriber acquisition and turnover will be successful. A high rate of turnover or low or negative rate of new subscriber acquisition would reduce revenues and increase the total marketing expenditures required to attract the minimum number of subscribers required to sustain our business plan which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain the roaming services we need from other carriers to remain competitive.\nSome of our competitors have national networks which enable them to offer nationwide coverage to their subscribers at a lower cost than we can offer. The networks we operate do not, by themselves, provide national coverage and we must pay fees to other carriers who provide roaming services to us. We currently rely on roaming agreements with several carriers for the majority of our roaming services.\nThe FCC requires commercial mobile radio service providers to provide roaming, upon request, for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The FCC also requires carriers to offer data roaming services. The rules do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates for voice, SMS text messaging or data services and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates. If we were to lose the benefit of one or more key roaming or wholesale agreements unexpectedly, we may be unable to obtain similar replacement agreements and as a result may be unable to continue providing nationwide voice and data roaming services for our customers or may be unable to provide such services on a cost-effective basis. Our inability to obtain new or replacement roaming services on a cost-effective basis may limit our ability to compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase our turnover and decrease our revenues, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully complete the integration of the wireless subscribers acquired from ACS in the Wireless Acquisition or we may be unable to realize the remaining anticipated synergies.\nOn February 2, 2015, we completed the Wireless Acquisition which included the acquisition of wireless subscribers from ACS. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to effectively complete the integration of the new wireless subscribers or recognize the remaining expected synergies. The integration that followed the subscriber acquisition continues to require significant time and focus from management and diverts attention from the day-to-day operations of our other businesses and our strategic objectives. Integration difficulties and an inability to realize the remaining anticipated synergies could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation. Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nWireless Services. The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless communications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to:\n\u2022\nHow radio spectrum is used by licensees;\n\u2022\nThe nature of the services that licensees may offer and how such services may be offered; and\n\u2022\nResolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.\nAlthough the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of market entry and the rates charged by commercial mobile radio service providers, states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer-related issues. These regulations could increase the costs of our wireless operations. The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation. FCC rules require all wireless licensees to meet certain build-out requirements and substantially comply with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, in order to retain their licenses. Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area. There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed.\nCommercial mobile radio service providers must implement E911 capabilities in accordance with FCC rules. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with such FCC rules, the failure to deploy E911 service consistent with FCC requirements could subject us to significant fines.\nThe FCC, together with the Federal Aviation Administration, also regulates tower marking and lighting. In addition, tower construction is affected by federal, state and local statutes addressing zoning, environmental protection and historic preservation. The FCC requires local notice in any community in which it is seeking FCC Antenna Structure Registration to build a tower. Local notice provides members of the community with an opportunity to comment on or challenge the tower construction for environmental reasons. This rule could cause delay for certain tower construction projects.\nInternet Services. On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. The order prohibits broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, and from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic. The order also strengthens transparency rules, which require accurate and truthful service disclosures, sufficient for consumers to make informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices. The order allows broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion. The new rules apply equally to wired and wireless broadband services. The order refrains from imposing rate regulation or tariff requirements on broadband services.\nWe cannot predict how the FCC will interpret or apply its new rules. In addition, although the FCC forbore from many of the provisions of Title II, we cannot predict how the FCC will interpret or apply the statutory provisions and regulations from which it did not forbear. It is possible that the FCC could interpret or apply its new rules or \u201cTitle II\u201d statutory provisions or regulations in a way that has a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. There also is a risk class action lawsuits arising under the provisions of Title II from which the FCC did not forbear could have similar negative impacts.\nProposals have been made before Congress to mandate Open Internet regulation that could supplement or supplant in whole or part the FCC\u2019s new rules. We currently cannot predict whether any such legislation will be adopted nor what impacts are most likely.\nVideo Services. The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels, and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals. The law permits certified local franchising authorities to order refunds of rates paid in the previous 12-month period determined to be in excess of the reasonable rates. It is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future.\nOther existing federal regulations, currently the subject of judicial, legislative, and administrative review, could change, in varying degrees, the manner in which video systems operate. Neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact on the cable television industry in general, or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular, can be predicted at this time. There can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by Congress, the FCC or other federal, state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nLocal Access Services. Our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection, access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services. Our local telephone services business faces the risk of unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations. Our ability to provide service in the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier\u2019s existing local telephone network (in some Alaska markets at cost-based rates), to establish dialing parity, to obtain access to rights-of-way, to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier, and in some cases, to allow the purchase, at cost-based rates, of access to unbundled network elements. Future negotiations or arbitration proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the ILEC or via wholesale offerings.\nFor more information about Regulations affecting our operations, see \u201cPart 1 -Item 1 - Business - Regulation.\u201d\nLoss of our ETC status would disqualify us for USF support.\nThe USF pays support to ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline and wireless telephone service in high cost areas. If we were to lose our ETC status in any of the study areas where we are currently an authorized ETC whether due to legislative or regulatory reform or our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we would be ineligible to receive USF support for providing service in that area. Loss of our ETC status could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nRevenues and accounts receivable from USF support may be reduced or lost.\nWe receive support from each of the various USF programs: high cost, low income, rural health care, and schools and libraries. This support was 19%, 19%, and 18% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had USF net receivables of $98.1 million and $109.6 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The programs are subject to change by regulatory actions taken by the FCC or legislative actions. Changes to any of the USF programs that we participate in could result in a material decrease in revenue and accounts receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nSee \u201cDescription of Our Business by Reportable Segment - Regulation - Wireless Services and Products - Universal Service\u201d and \u201cDescription of Our Business by Reportable Segment - Regulation - Wireline Voice Services and Products - Universal Service\u201d for more information.\nProgramming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe expect programming expenses for our video services to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. The multichannel video provider industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming and costs to retransmit local broadcast stations. As we add programming to our video services or if we choose to distribute existing programming to our customers through additional delivery platforms, we may incur increased programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers\u2019 rates or offset such programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Moreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of our video services and our business could be adversely affected.\nThe decline in our Wireline segment voice services\u2019 results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, may accelerate.\nWe expect our Wireline voice services\u2019 results of operations, which include long-distance and local access services, will continue to decline. As competition from wireless carriers, such as ourselves, increases we expect our long-distance and local access services' subscribers and revenues will continue to decline and the rate of decline may accelerate.\nWe may not be able to satisfy the requirements of our participation in a New Markets Tax Credit (\"NMTC\") program for funding our TERRA-NW project.\nIn 2011 and 2012 we entered into three separate arrangements under the NMTC program with US Bancorp to help fund various phases of our TERRA-NW project. In connection with the NMTC transactions we received proceeds which were restricted for use on TERRA-NW. The NMTCs are subject to 100% recapture of the tax credit for a period of seven years as provided in the Internal Revenue Code. We are required to be in compliance with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangements. We have agreed to indemnify US Bancorp for any loss or recapture of its $56.0 million in NMTCs until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved in December 2019. Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized by US Bancorp and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nFailure to complete development, testing and deployment of a new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry. In addition, the technology we use may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe develop, test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services or features. Successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend, in part, on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner. We may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner, and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable, in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology. Deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services. Any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. In addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions could negatively affect our business including our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as our ability to service debt, pay other obligations and enhance shareholder returns. While it is often difficult for us to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could adversely affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forgo purchases of our products and services. One or more of these circumstances could cause our revenue to decline. Also, our customers may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we could be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, and the number of days outstanding for our accounts receivable could increase.\nOur business is geographically concentrated in Alaska. Any deterioration in the economic conditions in Alaska could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe offer wireless and wireline telecommunication services, data services, video services, and managed services to customers primarily throughout Alaska. Because of this geographic concentration, growth of our business and operations depends upon economic conditions in Alaska. The economy of Alaska is dependent upon the oil\nindustry, state government spending, United States military spending, investment earnings and tourism. Oil prices have dropped precipitously recently which has put significant pressure on the Alaska state government budget since the majority of its revenues come from the oil industry. While the Alaska state government has significant reserves that we believe will help fund the state government for the next couple of years, major structural budgetary reforms will need to be implemented in order to offset the impact of declining oil prices. Prolonged periods of low oil prices will adversely impact the Alaska economy, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the demand for our products and services and on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if the Alaska state government fails to implement appropriate structural budgetary reforms, we may potentially have to reduce our capital expenditures, which in turn could limit our opportunities for future growth.\nAdditionally, the customer base in Alaska is limited and we have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in Anchorage and other locations in Alaska. We may not be able to continue to increase our market share of the existing markets for our services, and no assurance can be given that the Alaskan economy will grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer. As a result, the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the lower 49 states. There can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside of Alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities. The markets in Alaska for wireless and wireline telecommunications and video services are unique and distinct within the United States due to Alaska\u2019s large geographical size, its sparse population located in a limited number of clusters, and its distance from the rest of the United States. The expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in Alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets.\nNatural or man-made disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur technical infrastructure (including our communications network infrastructure and ancillary functions supporting our network such as service activation, billing and customer care) is vulnerable to damage or interruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, natural disasters, fires, human error, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing or similar events. As a communications provider, there is an increased risk that our technological infrastructure may be targeted in connection with terrorism or cyberattacks, either as a primary target, or as a means of facilitating additional attacks on other targets.\nIn addition, earthquakes, floods, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt our business operations or our provision of service in one or more markets. Costs we incur to restore, repair or replace our network or technical infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use, may be substantial and increase our cost of providing service. Any failure in or interruption of systems that we or third parties maintain to support ancillary functions, such as billing, point of sale, inventory management, customer care and financial reporting, could materially impact our ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to our business. If any of the above events were to occur, we could experience higher churn, reduced revenues and increased costs, any of which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, our insurance may not be adequate to cover the costs associated with a natural disaster or terrorist attack.\nCyberattacks or other network disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nCyberattacks against our technological infrastructure or breaches of network information technology may cause equipment failures, disruption of our operations, and potentially unauthorized access to confidential customer data. Cyberattacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses, and other means for service disruption or unauthorized access to confidential customer data, have increased in frequency, scope, and potential harm for businesses in recent years. It is possible for such cyberattacks to go undetected for an extended period of time, increasing the potential harm to our customers, our assets, and our reputation.\nTo date, we have not been subject to cyberattacks or network disruptions that individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition. Nevertheless, we engage in a variety of preventive measures at an increased cost to us, in order to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and safeguard our infrastructure and confidential customer information. Such measures include, but are not limited to the following industry best practices: application whitelisting, anti-malware, message and spam filtering, encryption, advanced firewalls, threat\ndetection, and URL filtering. Despite these preventive and detective actions, our efforts may be insufficient to repel a major cyberattack or network disruption in the future.\nSome of the most significant risks to our information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure include:\n\u2022\nCyberattacks that disrupt, damage, and gain unauthorized access to our network and computer systems including data breaches caused by criminal or terrorist activities;\n\u2022\nUndesired human actions including intentional or accidental errors;\n\u2022\nMalware (including viruses, worms, cryptoware, and Trojan horses), software defects, unsolicited mass advertising, denial of service, and other malicious or abusive attacks by third parties;\n\u2022\nUnauthorized access to our information technology, billing, customer care, and provisioning systems and networks and those of our vendors and other providers; and,\n\u2022\nDisruptions and damage caused by natural disasters, power surges, or equipment failure.\nIf hackers or cyberthieves gain improper access to our technology systems, networks, or infrastructure, they may be able to access, steal, publish, delete, misappropriate, modify or otherwise disrupt access to confidential customer data. Moreover, additional harm to customers could be perpetrated by third parties who are given access to the confidential customer data. Relatedly, a network disruption (including one resulting from a cyberattack) could cause an interruption or degradation of service as well as permit access, theft, publishing, deletion, misappropriation, or modification to or of confidential customer data. Due to the evolving techniques used in cyberattacks to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to technology networks, we may not be able to anticipate or prevent such disruption or unauthorized access.\nThe costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant. Among others, such costs could include increased expenditures on cyber security measures,litigation, fines, and sanctions, lost revenues from business interruption, and damage to the public\u2019s perception regarding our ability to provide a secure service. As a result, a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIncreases in data usage on our wired and wireless networks may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions, reduced capacity or slower transmission speeds for our customers.\nVideo streaming services and peer-to-peer file sharing applications use significantly more bandwidth than traditional Internet activity such as web browsing and email. As use of these newer services continues to grow, our customers will likely use more bandwidth than in the past. Additionally, new wireless handsets and devices may place a higher demand for data on our wireless network. If this occurs, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity in order to avoid service disruptions, service degradation or slower transmission speeds for our customers. Alternatively, we could choose to implement network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and attract customers in affected areas. While we believe demand for these services may drive customers to pay for faster speeds, competitive or regulatory constraints may preclude us from recovering the costs of the necessary network investments which could result in an adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nProlonged service interruptions or system failures could affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on our network equipment, communications providers, data and software to support all of our functions. We rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues. We are able to deliver services and serve our customers only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other disruptions. While we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back-up systems and procedures, we cannot guarantee that these back-up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency. Disruption to our billing systems due to a failure of existing hardware and backup protocols could have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flow. Should we experience a prolonged failure, it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations. In particular, should a significant service interruption occur, our ongoing customers may choose a different provider, and our reputation may be damaged, reducing our attractiveness to new customers.\nIf failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cable systems or our TERRA facilities and its extensions, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited and we could incur significant costs, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nOur communications facilities include undersea fiber optic cable systems that carry a large portion of our traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states, one of which provides an alternative geographically diverse backup communication facility to the other. Our facilities also include TERRA and its extensions which are unringed, operating in a remote environment and are at times difficult to access for repairs. If a failure of both sides of the ring of our undersea fiber optic facilities or of our unringed TERRA facility and its extensions occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Damage to an undersea fiber optic cable system or TERRA and its extensions could result in significant unplanned expense which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nIf a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems, our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited.\nOur communications facilities include satellite transponders that we use to serve many rural and remote Alaska locations. Each of our C-band and Ku-band satellite transponders is backed up using on-board transponder redundancy. In the event of a complete spacecraft failure the services are restored using capacity on other spacecraft that are held in reserve. If a failure of our satellite transponders occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply communications equipment. If we do not obtain the necessary communications equipment, we will not be able to meet the needs of our customers.\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party vendors to supply wireless, Internet, video and other telephony-related equipment. If our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand. Due to the unique characteristics of the Alaska communications markets (i.e., remote locations, rural, satellite-served, low density populations, and our leading edge services and products), in many situations we deploy and utilize specialized, advanced technology and equipment that may not have a large market or demand. Our vendors may not succeed in developing sufficient market penetration to sustain continuing production and may fail. Vendor bankruptcy, or acquisition without continuing product support by the acquiring company, may require us to replace technology before its otherwise useful end of life due to lack of on-going vendor support and product development.\nThe suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as they develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.\nWe do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject, which could lead to the occurrence of uninsured liabilities that adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nAs is typical in the communications industry, we are self-insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities, including our buried, undersea and above-ground fiber optic cable systems. If we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities, our financial position, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.\nOur significant debt and capital lease obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Senior Notes, Senior Credit Facility, other debt or capital leases.\nWe have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt and capital lease obligations. On December 31, 2015, we had long-term debt of $1,344.8 million and long-term capital lease obligations of $59.7 million. Our high level of debt and capital lease obligations could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nIncreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nRequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nExposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent of any future borrowings, including borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nMaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and Senior Credit Facility, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes and the agreements governing such other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nRestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nLimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nLimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage may prevent us from exploiting.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and to meet other obligations. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. If we are unable to meet our future capital needs it may be necessary for us to curtail, delay or abandon our business growth plans. If we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans, it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital.\nWe will continue to require a significant amount of cash to satisfy our debt service requirements and to meet other obligations. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash and to arrange additional financing in the future. These abilities are subject to, among other factors, our credit rating, our financial performance, general economic conditions, prevailing market conditions, the state of competition in our market, the outcome of certain legislative and regulatory issues and other factors that may be beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe terms of our debt impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the Senior Notes.\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facility and other loans contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest.\nAll of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply. A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing our Senior Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility. If there were an event of default under the indentures for the Senior Notes and/or the Senior Credit Facility, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately. Additionally, if we fail to repay the debt under the Senior Credit Facility when it becomes due, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock of our\nsubsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.\nWhen our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace one or both.\nWhen our Senior Credit Facility and Senior Notes mature, we will likely need to refinance them and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict our financial and operating flexibility.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flow could decrease.\nIn order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, in the future, we may enter into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments. If we are unable to enter into interest rate swaps, it may adversely affect our cash flow and may impact our ability to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nAny significant impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.\nWe had $520.3 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2015, consisting of goodwill of $239.3 million, cable certificates of $191.6 million, wireless licenses of $86.3 million and broadcast licenses of $3.1 million. Our cable certificates represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business. Our wireless licenses are from the FCC and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area. Our broadcast licenses represent permission to use a portion of the radio frequency spectrum in a given geographical area for broadcasting purposes. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions.\nIf we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and/or the indefinite-lived intangible assets, as appropriate, and the fair value of the goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets, in the period in which the determination is made. The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies. Any changes to key assumptions, or actual performance compared with those assumptions, about our business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value, resulting in an impairment charge.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAt December 31, 2015, we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of $340.5 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, under the Internal Revenue Code, we may carry forward these net operating losses in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury regulations at a time when our market capitalization is below a certain level, our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited. This limit could impact the timing of the usage of the net operating loss carryforwards, thus accelerating cash tax payments or\ncausing net operating loss carryforwards to expire prior to their use, which could affect the ultimate realization of that deferred tax asset.\nConcerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our wireless services.\nPortable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks, including cancer, due to radio frequency emissions from these devices. Purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed from time to time against other wireless companies seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase the cost of doing business. We cannot be sure of the outcome of any such cases or that the industry will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks. The actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers. Further research and studies are ongoing, with no linkage between health risks and mobile phone use established to date by a credible public source. However, we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns.\nA significant percentage of our voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control shareholder decisions on very important matters.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned 14% of our combined outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, representing 24% of the combined voting power of that stock. These shareholders can significantly influence, if not control, our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions, including mergers, substantial acquisitions and dispositions, and election of directors to the Board.\nWe invest in early-stage, venture backed companies.\nThe companies in which we invest are entrants to markets with new products or services. These companies generally have revenue that does not cover the companies\u2019 operating and capital expenditures. As a result, the companies typically operate with monthly net losses and may require additional funding for operating and capital. Given that, among other things, these companies are at an early stage in their life cycle and are often proving their business model, these companies may fail, go bankrupt, and lose all or substantially all of their value which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.", "PERMNO": 17334, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "GLIBA"}
