Risk Factors\nThe homebuilding industry is cyclical in nature and has experienced downturns, which have in the past and may in the future cause the Company to incur losses in financial and operating results.\nThe Company is affected by the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry, which is sensitive to many factors, including fluctuations in general and local economic conditions; interest rates; housing demand; employment levels; levels of new and existing homes for sale; demographic trends; availability of homeowner financing; and consumer confidence. In recent years, the markets served by the Company, and the U.S. homebuilding industry as a whole, experienced a prolonged decrease in demand for new homes, as well as an oversupply of new and existing homes available-for-sale. In addition, an oversupply of alternatives to new homes, such as rental properties and existing homes, can depress prices and reduce margins.\nDemand for new homes is sensitive to economic conditions over which the Company has no control, such as the availability of mortgage financing and the level of employment.\nDemand for new homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels. During the last few years, the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant instability. As a result of increased default rates, particularly (but not entirely) with regard to subprime and other nonconforming loans, many lenders have reduced their willingness to make residential mortgage loans and have tightened their credit requirements with regard to them. Fewer loan products, stricter loan qualification standards and higher down payments have made it more difficult for some borrowers to finance home purchases. Although the Company's financial services segment offers mortgage loans to potential buyers, the Company may no longer be able to offer financing terms that are attractive to those buyers. Lack of available mortgage financing at acceptable rates reduces demand for the homes the Company builds and, in some instances, causes potential buyers to cancel contracts they have signed.\nBecause most of the Company's homebuyers finance the purchase of their homes, the terms and availability of mortgage financing can affect the demand for and the ability to complete the purchase of a home, as well as the Company's future operating and financial results.\nThe Company's business and earnings depend on the ability of its homebuyers to obtain financing for the purchase of their homes. Many of the Company's homebuyers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from the Company. In recent years, the mortgage lending industry as a whole experienced significant instability due to, among other things, defaults on subprime and other loans, resulting in the declining market value of such loans. In light of these developments, lenders, investors, regulators and other third parties questioned the adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for several loan programs made available to borrowers in recent years. This has led to tightened credit requirements and an increase in indemnity claims for mortgages that were originated and sold by the Company. Deterioration in credit quality among subprime and other nonconforming loans has caused most lenders to eliminate subprime mortgages and most other loan products that do not conform to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA or VA standards. Fewer loan products and tighter loan qualifications, in turn, make it more difficult for a borrower to finance the purchase of a new home or the purchase of an existing home from a potential move-up buyer who wishes to purchase one of the Company's homes. If the Company's potential homebuyers or the buyers of the homebuyers' existing homes cannot obtain suitable financing, or if increased indemnity claims are made for mortgages that are originated and sold, the result will have an adverse effect on the Company's operating and financial results and performance.\nRising interest rates; decreased availability of mortgage financing or of certain mortgage programs; higher down payment requirements; or increased monthly mortgage costs, as discussed above, may lead to reduced demand for the Company's homes and mortgage loan services. Increased interest rates can also hinder the Company's ability to realize its backlog because its home purchase contracts provide customers with a financing contingency. Financing contingencies allow customers to cancel their home purchase contracts in the event that they cannot arrange for adequate financing. As a result, rising interest rates can decrease the Company's home sales and mortgage originations. Any of these factors could have an adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of turbulence in the credit markets and mortgage finance industry in 2008 and 2009, the federal government has taken on a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, and its insurance of mortgages originated by lenders through the FHA and VA. FHA backing of mortgages has recently been particularly important to the mortgage finance industry and to the Company's business. In 2014, 31.3 percent of the Company's homebuyers who chose to finance with RMC purchased a home using an FHA- or VA-backed loan. In addition, the Federal Reserve has purchased a sizable amount of mortgage-backed securities in an effort to stabilize mortgage interest rates and to support the market for mortgage-backed securities. The availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including consumer interest rates for such loans, could be adversely affected by a curtailment or ceasing of the federal government's mortgage-related programs or policies. The FHA may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards, raise minimum down payment requirements, impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs, and/or limit the number of mortgages it insures. Due to growing federal budget deficits, the U.S. Treasury may not be able to continue supporting the mortgage-related activities of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA and the VA at present levels, or it may significantly revise the federal government's participation in and support of the residential mortgage market. In this regard, the Federal Reserve has announced reductions in its monthly bond purchase stimulus program.\nSince the availability of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA- and VA-backed mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing and selling many of the Company's homes, any limitations, restrictions or changes in the availability of such government-backed financing could reduce its home sales and adversely affect the Company's results of operations, including its income from RMC.\nThe Company may be subject to indemnification claims on mortgages sold to third parties.\nSubstantially all of the loans the Company originates are sold within a short period of time in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing-released basis. The mortgage industry has experienced substantial increases in delinquencies, foreclosures and foreclosures-in-process. All mortgages are generally sold, and under certain limited circumstances RMC is required to indemnify loan investors for losses incurred on sold loans. Reserves are created to address repurchase and indemnity claims made by these third-party investors or purchasers. These reserves are based on pending claims received that are associated with previously sold mortgage loans, industry foreclosure data, the Company's portfolio delinquency and foreclosure rates on sold loans made available by investors, as well as on historical loss payment patterns used to develop ultimate loss projections. Estimating loss has been made more difficult by the recent processing delays related to foreclosure losses affecting agencies and financial institutions. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating these matters, the Company cannot provide assurance that the amounts reserved will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have an adverse effect on its results of operations.\nTax law changes could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive.\nSignificant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, generally are deductible expenses for the purpose of calculating an individual's federal and, in some cases, state taxable income, subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy. If federal or state governments change income tax laws by eliminating or substantially reducing these income tax benefits, as some policymakers have discussed, the after-tax cost of owning a new home will increase significantly. This could adversely impact both demand for and/or sales prices of new homes.\nThe Company is subject to inventory risk for its land, options for land, building lots and housing inventory.\nThe market value of the Company's land, building lots and housing inventories fluctuates as a result of changing market and economic conditions. In addition, inventory carrying costs can result in losses in poorly performing projects or markets. Changes in economic and market conditions have caused the Company to dispose of land and options for land and housing inventories on a basis that has resulted in loss and required it to write down or reduce the carrying value of its inventory. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company decided not to pursue development and construction in certain areas where it held land or made option deposits, which resulted in $2.5 million in recorded write-offs of option deposits and preacquisition feasibility costs. The Company can provide no assurance that it will not need to record additional write-offs in the future.\nIn the course of its business, the Company makes land acquisitions. Although it employs various measures, including its land approval process and continued review by senior management, designed to manage inventory risk, the Company cannot assure that these measures will enable it to avoid or eliminate its inventory risk.\nConstruction costs can fluctuate and impact the Company's margins.\nThe homebuilding industry has, from time to time, experienced significant difficulties, including shortages of qualified tradespeople; reliance on local subcontractors who may be inadequately capitalized; shortages of materials; and volatile increases in the cost of materials, particularly increases in the prices of lumber, drywall and cement, which are significant components of home construction costs. The Company may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices because of either market conditions or because it fixes its prices at the time home sales contracts are signed.\nSupply shortages and other risks related to demand for building materials and/or skilled labor could increase costs and delay deliveries.\nThere is a high level of competition in the homebuilding industry for skilled labor and building materials. Rising costs or shortages in building materials or skilled labor could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays. The Company is generally unable to pass on increases in construction costs to homebuyers who have already entered into purchase contracts. A purchase contract generally fixes the price of the home at the time the contract is signed, and this may occur well in advance of when construction commences. Further, the Company may not be able to pass on rising construction costs because of market conditions. Sustained increases in construction costs due to competition for materials and skilled labor, as well as higher commodity prices (including prices for lumber, metals and other building material inputs), among other things, may decrease the Company's margins over time.\nShortages in the availability of subcontract labor may delay construction schedules and increase the Company's costs.\nThe Company conducts its construction operations as a general contractor with construction and development work performed by unaffiliated third-party subcontractors. As a consequence, the Company depends on the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by these subcontractors for the design and construction of its homes. The Company cannot make assurances that there will be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third-party subcontractors. In addition, inadequate subcontractor resources could delay the Company's construction schedules and have a material adverse effect on its business.\nBecause the homebuilding industry is competitive, the business practices of other homebuilders can have an impact on the Company's financial results and cause these results to decline.\nThe residential homebuilding industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with a large number of national, regional and local homebuilding companies in each of its markets. This competition could cause the Company to adjust selling prices in response to competitive conditions in the markets in which it operates and could require it to increase the use of sales incentives. The Company cannot predict whether these measures will be successful or if additional incentives will be made in the future. It also competes with other housing alternatives, including existing homes and rental housing. The homebuilding industry's principal competitive factors are home price, availability of customer financing, design, quality, reputation, relationships with developers, accessibility of subcontractors, and availability and location of homesites. Any of the foregoing factors could have an adverse impact on the Company's financial performance and results of operations.\nThe Company's financial services segment competes with other mortgage bankers to arrange financing for homebuyers. The principal competitive factors for the financial services segment include interest rates, fees and other features of mortgage loan products available to the consumer.\nHomebuilding is subject to warranty claims in the ordinary course of business that can be subject to uncertainty.\nAs a homebuilder, the Company is subject to warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records warranty and other reserves for the homes it sells to cover expected costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods based on historical experience in the Company's\nmarkets and on the judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built by the Company, including analyses of historical claims. Because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, the Company cannot provide assurance that the amounts reserved for warranty claims will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have an adverse effect on its results of operations.\nBecause the Company's business is subject to various regulatory and environmental limitations, it may not be able to conduct its business as planned.\nThe Company's homebuilding segments are subject to various local, state and federal laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction, stormwater permitting and discharge, and similar matters, as well as open spaces, wetlands and environmentally protected areas. These include local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area, as well as other municipal or city land planning restrictions, requirements or limitations. The Company may also experience periodic delays in homebuilding projects due to regulatory compliance, municipal appeals and other governmental planning processes in any of the markets in which it operates. These factors could result in delays or increased operational costs.\nWith respect to originating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans, the Company's financial services segment is subject to the rules and regulations of FHA, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, VA and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). Mortgage origination activities are further subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Federal Truth-in-Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and their associated regulations. These and other federal and state statutes and regulations prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines that include provisions for audits, inspections and appraisals; require credit reports on prospective borrowers; fix maximum loan amounts; and require the disclosure of certain information concerning credit and settlement costs. The Company is required to submit audited financial statements annually, and each agency or other entity has its own financial requirements. The Company's affairs are also subject to examination by these entities at all times to assure compliance with applicable regulations, policies and procedures.\nThe Company's ability to grow its business and operations depends, to a significant degree, upon its ability to access capital on favorable terms.\nThe ability to access capital on favorable terms is an important factor in growing the Company's business and operations in a profitable manner. In 2007, Moody's lowered the Company's debt rating to non-investment grade, and Standard & Poor's (\"S&P\") also reduced the Company's investment-grade rating to non-investment grade in 2008. The Company received additional downgrades in 2008 and 2011. At December 31, 2014, Moody's reported the Company's rating outlook as stable and S&P reported its rating outlook as positive. The loss of an investment-grade rating affects the cost, availability and terms of credit available to the Company, making it more difficult and costly to access the debt capital markets for funds that may be required to implement its business plans.\nNatural disasters may have a significant impact on the Company's business.\nThe climates and geology of many of the states in which the Company operates present increased risks of natural disasters. To the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, tornadoes, earthquakes, droughts, floods, wildfires or other natural disasters or similar events occur, its business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm the Company's business.\nThe Company's information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers, Web browsers, telephone systems and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past. While it takes measures to ensure its major systems have redundant capabilities, the Company's systems are susceptible to outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, cyber attacks and similar events. Despite the Company's implementation of network security measures, its servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions resulting from unauthorized tampering with its computer systems. The occurrence of any of these events could disrupt or damage the Company's information technology systems and hamper its internal operations, its ability to provide services to its customers and the ability of its customers to access the Company's information technology systems. In addition, the Company's business\nrequires the collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data. The Company also maintains personally identifiable information about its employees. The integrity and protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to the Company. A material network breach in the security of the Company's information technology systems could include the theft of customer or employee data or its intellectual property or trade secrets. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to the Company's data, or in the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to its reputation, affect relationships with its customers, reduce demand for the Company's services, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm its business. In addition, the Company may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nThe Company's short-term investments and marketable securities are subject to certain risks which could materially and adversely affect its overall financial condition.\nThe Company invests a portion of its available cash and cash equivalent balances by purchasing marketable securities with maturities in excess of three months in a managed portfolio. The primary objectives of these investments are the preservation of capital and the maintenance of a high degree of liquidity, with a secondary objective being the attainment of yields higher than those earned on the Company's cash and cash equivalent balances. Should any of the Company's short-term investments or marketable securities lose value or have their liquidity impaired, it could materially and adversely affect the Company's overall financial condition by limiting its ability to fund operations.", "PERMNO": 62383, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "RYL"}
