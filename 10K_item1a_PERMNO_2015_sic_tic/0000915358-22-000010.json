{"cik": "915358", "company": "SIGMATRON INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-07-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry or financial position or our future financial performance. While the Company believes it has identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting its business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect its business, operations, industry, financial position and financial performance in the future.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been impacted and may in the future be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our operations and regions, including its effect on our operations, employees, trade customers, suppliers and distribution channels. Since 2020, the pandemic has created significant business disruption and economic uncertainty which adversely impacted our manufacturing operations, supply chain, and distribution channels and we continue to face unique challenges caused by COVID-19 pandemic in 2022. While the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been assessed, the long-term magnitude and duration of the disruption, including supply chain disruption, and resulting impact on global business activity remain uncertain. Many factors have impacted us and they, and others, may continue to impact us in the future, including timing and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, as well as vaccination rates among the population in the United States and many of the countries in which we operate. The adverse impact of the pandemic is expected to continue and may materially affect our results of operations and financial condition in future periods.\nRaw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results.\nThe supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. The Company has experienced supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and continued disruptions to the supply chain could adversely affect the Company's ability to meet commitments to customers. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and the Company is currently experiencing upward pricing pressure on raw materials. Significant price increases could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and operating margins. In particular, inflation, changes in trade policies, the imposition of duties and tariffs, potential retaliatory countermeasures, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and geopolitical conflicts could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials. The Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. Consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe Company experiences variable operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations have varied and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period, including on a quarterly basis. Consequently, results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period, and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Some of these factors include:\n- changes in sales mix to customers\n- changes in availability and rising component costs\n- volume of customer orders relative to capacity\n- market demand and acceptance of our customers\u2019 products\n- price erosion within the EMS marketplace\n- capital equipment requirements needed to remain technologically competitive\n- volatility in the U.S. and international economic and financial markets\nThe volume and timing of sales to the Company\u2019s customers may vary due to:\n- component availability\n- customers\u2019 attempts to manage their inventory\n- variation in demand for the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 products\n- design changes\n- acquisitions of or consolidation among customers\nMost of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 production schedules are volatile, which makes it difficult to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities and manage inventory levels.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty can make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity and manage inventory levels. The Company could be required to increase or decrease staffing and more closely manage other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of its customers. Orders from the Company\u2019s customers could be cancelled or delivery schedules could be deferred as a result of changes in our customers\u2019 demand, thereby adversely affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations in any given period.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is volatile.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock historically has experienced significant volatility due to fluctuations in the Company\u2019s revenue and earnings, other factors relating to the Company\u2019s operations, the market\u2019s changing expectations for the Company\u2019s growth, overall equity market conditions and other factors unrelated to the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, the limited float of the Company\u2019s common stock and the limited number of market makers also affect the volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock. Such fluctuations are expected to continue in the future.\nMarket Risks\nOur customers have competitive challenges, including rapid technological changes, pricing pressures and decreasing demand from their customers, which could adversely affect their business and the Company\u2019s business.\nFactors affecting the industries that utilize our customers\u2019 products could negatively impact our customers and the Company. These factors include:\n- increased competition among our customers and their competitors\n- the inability of our customers to develop and market their products\n- the inability of our customers to obtain all necessary material to manufacture their products\n- recessionary periods in our customers\u2019 markets\n- the potential that our customers\u2019 products become obsolete\n- our customers\u2019 inability to react to rapidly changing technology\nAny such factor or a combination of factors could negatively impact our customers\u2019 need for or ability to pay for our products, which could, in turn, affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nOur exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nOn occasion, we provide services to customers, and rely upon suppliers that have in the past and may in the future experience financial difficulty. If any of the Company\u2019s customers have financial difficulties, the Company could encounter delays or defaults in the payment of amounts owed for accounts receivable and\ninventory obligations. Additionally, if our suppliers experience financial difficulties, we could have difficulty sourcing supplies necessary for production requirements. These risks may be heightened by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent economic volatility. Any financially troubled customer or supplier could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s customer base is concentrated.\nSales to the Company\u2019s five largest customers accounted for 55.3% and 57.8% of net sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022, and April 30, 2021, respectively. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, two customers accounted for 21.8% and 11.7% of net sales of the Company, and 4.0% and 3.2%, respectively, of accounts receivable. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, two customers accounted for 17.9% and 16.2% of net sales of the Company, and 3.8% and 5.6%, respectively, of accounts receivable. Significant reductions in sales to any of the Company\u2019s major customers or the loss of a major customer could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations. If the Company cannot replace cancelled or reduced orders, sales will decline, which could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will retain any or all of its largest customers. This risk may be further complicated by pricing pressures and intense competition prevalent in our industry.\nThe Company faces intense industry competition and downward pricing pressures.\nThe EMS industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater experience, as well as greater manufacturing, purchasing, marketing and financial resources than the Company. Competition from existing or potential new competitors may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. The introduction of lower priced competitive products, significant price reductions by the Company\u2019s competitors or significant pricing pressures from its customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdverse market conditions could reduce our future sales and earnings per share.\nUncertainty over the erosion of global consumer confidence amidst concerns about volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, declining asset values, inflation, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, and sovereign nations has slowed global economic growth. The economic recovery of recent years is fragile and recessionary conditions have returned. Any of these potential negative economic conditions may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 products and adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales. Consequently, the Company\u2019s past operating results, earnings and cash flows may not be indicative of the Company\u2019s future operating results, earnings and cash flows.\nCustomer relationships with start-up companies present more risk.\nA small portion of the Company\u2019s current customer base is comprised of start-up companies. Customer relationships with start-up companies may present heightened risk due to the lack of product history. Slow market acceptance of their products could result in demand fluctuations causing inventory levels to rise. Further, the current economic environment could make it difficult for such emerging companies to obtain additional funding. This may result in additional credit risk including, but not limited to, the collection of trade account receivables and payment for their inventory. If the Company does not have adequate allowances recorded, the results of operations may be negatively affected.\nCapital and Financing Risks\nWe may fail to secure or maintain necessary additional financing or capital.\nAlthough we have credit facilities, we cannot be certain that our existing credit arrangements will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations and/or\nincreased working capital needs. If we do not comply with the covenants under any of our credit facilities, our ability to borrow would be adversely affected. In addition, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit facilities and receivables factoring programs, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations, either due to instability in the global financial markets or otherwise, which could, among other impacts, increase the duration of our cash collection cycle. While we currently believe we have ample liquidity to manage the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or global supply chain disruptions, we can give no assurance that this will continue to be the case if the impact of those conditions is prolonged or if there is an extended impact on us or the economy in general.\nOur future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives. Many of our borrowings are at variable interest rates and therefore our interest expense is subject to increase if rates increase.\nWe may seek to raise additional capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining new facilities, or through a combination of these methods. We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms. If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders\u2019 ownership interests; we may not be able to offer our securities on attractive or acceptable terms in the event of volatility or weakness in our stock price. Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any current or future financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.\nAlthough forgiven, the Company\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program Loan (\u201cPPP Loan\u201d) remains subject to audit.\nOn April 23, 2020 the Company received proceeds of $6,282,973 from a PPP Loan under the CARES Act, which it used to retain current U.S. employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments. The PPP Loan was forgiven on July 9, 2021. However, due to the size of the PPP Loan, it is subject to audit by the SBA for up to six years after forgiveness, which introduces an additional layer of uncertainty. In order to apply for the PPP Loan, the Company was required to certify, that the then current economic uncertainty, including, among other factors, the short term customer demand reduction, made the PPP Loan request necessary to support its ongoing operations. The Company made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, the continued employment of its entire U.S. workforce, certain obvious \u201cwork-from-home\u201d limitations associated with the nature of its business, and its ability to meet fixed cost obligations, in light of customer concerns. Furthermore, the Company considered its classification as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC rules and its need for additional funding to continue operations, and its lack of ability to currently access alternative forms of capital in the market environment to fund working capital requirements. Based on this analysis, the Company believes that it satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan, and that the receipt of the PPP Loan is consistent with the broad objectives of the CARES Act. If, despite the Company\u2019s actions and certification that it satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP Loan, it is later determined that it violated applicable laws or was otherwise ineligible to receive the PPP Loan, it may be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety in a lump sum or be subject to additional penalties and interest, which could also result in adverse publicity and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. If these events were to transpire, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTax/Legal and Regulatory Risks\nUncertainty related to environmental regulation and industry standards, as well as physical risks of climate change, could impact the Company's results of operations and financial position.\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate climate change and other environmental risks. These regulations or standards could mandate even more restrictive requirements, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. In addition, the physical risks\nof climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather events or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather events. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, or the Company's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, the Company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe U.S. government has indicated its intent to adopt a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including raw materials utilized by the Company. Changes in U.S. trade policy could result in one or more of the U.S.\u2019 trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for the Company to import our products from those countries. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in a lower margin on products sold.\nChina and the European Union have imposed tariffs on U.S. products in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Additional tariffs could be imposed by China and the European Union in response to proposed increased tariffs on products imported from China and the European Union. There is also a concern that the imposition of additional tariffs by the United States could result in the adoption of additional tariffs by other countries. The resulting trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States increase the price of or limit the amount of certain raw materials utilized by the Company imported into the United States, the costs of our raw materials may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Company pays interest on outstanding borrowings under its senior secured credit facility and certain other long-term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate. In recent months, global inflation and other factors have resulted in an increase in interest rates generally, and future borrowing costs may rise. An adverse change in the Company\u2019s interest rates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in the economy or political conditions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s sales and gross margins depend significantly on market demand for its customers\u2019 products. The uncertainty in the U.S. and international economic and political environments could result in a decline in demand for our customers\u2019 products in any industry. Further, any adverse changes in tax rates and laws or trade policies affecting our customers could result in decreasing gross margins. Any of these factors could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with environmental regulations could subject the Company to liability.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its manufacturing process. To date, the cost to the Company of such compliance has not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Further, the Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by the Company and could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure by the Company to comply with present or future regulations could subject it to future liabilities or the suspension of production which could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nConflict minerals regulations may cause the Company to incur additional expenses and could increase the cost of components contained in its products and adversely affect its inventory supply chain.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) thereunder, require the Company to determine and report annually whether any conflict minerals contained in our products originated from the DRC or an adjoining country. The Dodd-Frank Act and these rules could affect our ability to source components that contain conflict minerals at acceptable prices and could impact the availability of conflict minerals, since there may be only a limited number of suppliers of conflict-free conflict minerals. Our customers may require that our products contain only conflict-free conflict minerals, and our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet this requirement at a reasonable price or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting this requirement. Additionally, the Company may suffer reputational harm with our customers and other stakeholders if our products are not conflict-free. The Company could incur significant costs in the event we are unable to manufacture products that contain only conflict-free conflict minerals or to the extent that we are required to make changes to products, processes, or sources of supply due to the foregoing requirements or pressures.\nChanges in securities laws and regulations may increase costs.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and listing requirements subsequently adopted by NASDAQ in response to Sarbanes-Oxley, have required changes in corporate governance practices, internal control policies and securities disclosure and compliance practices of public companies. More recently the Dodd-Frank Act has required changes to our corporate governance, compliance practices and securities disclosures , and the SEC recently approved Nasdaq\u2019s board diversity proposal, immediately increasing the Company\u2019s disclosure requirements. Compliance following the implementation of these rules has increased our legal, financial and accounting costs. The Company expects increased costs related to these new regulations to continue, including, but not limited to, legal, financial and accounting costs. These developments may result in the Company having difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified members of the board or qualified officers. Further, the costs associated with the compliance with and implementation of procedures under these laws and related rules could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAny litigation, even where a claim is without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nIn the past, the Company has been notified of claims relating to various matters including contractual matters, product liability, labor issues or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the event of any such claim, the Company may be required to spend a significant amount of money and resources, even where the claim is without merit or covered by insurance. Accordingly, the resolution of such disputes, even those encountered in the ordinary course of business, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, consolidated financial conditions and results of operations.\nStrategic Transaction Risks\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the business combination between the Company and Wagz, Inc. (the \u201cWagz acquisition\u201d), including anticipated revenue and cost synergies, and costs associated with achieving synergies.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the Wagz acquisition, including anticipated revenue. There can be no assurance that a robust market for Wagz\u2019s products will materialize and that the Wagz acquisition will be beneficial to the Company. Moreover, it is likely that Wagz will not be able to achieve success without the Company continuing to invest significant funds in Wagz. Although Wagz is a stand-alone operation of the Company, and should benefit from the broader manufacturing and supply support that may be provided by the Company, the integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. Accordingly, the benefits from the Wagz acquisition may be offset by costs incurred or delays in Wagz\u2019s product launches. Any unexpected costs or delays incurred in connection with Wagz could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, as well as the market price of its common stock. In addition, even if Wagz\u2019s business succeeds, the Company may not realize the full benefits of the Wagz acquisition, including the sales or growth opportunities that it expects. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\nThe Company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions, including the acquisition of the Wagz in fiscal 2022. A number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. Impairment charges could adversely affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized. See Note F, Acquisitions of Item 15(a) Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, for a discussion related to impairment testing of goodwill for the year ended April 30, 2022. We concluded no impairment of long-lived assets as of April 30, 2022.\nTechnology Risks\nIf the security of the Company\u2019s Information Technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access, the Company\u2019s reputation may be severely harmed and it may be exposed to liability.\nThe Company\u2019s IT system stores confidential information which includes its financial information, its customers\u2019 proprietary information, product information, supplier information, and other critical data. Any accidental or willful security breach or other unauthorized access could expose the Company to liability for the loss of such information, adverse regulatory action by federal and state governments, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity, which could severely damage the Company\u2019s reputation. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee action or error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in its software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of the Company\u2019s customer data, its relationships with its customers may be severely damaged, and the Company could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the Company and its third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify customers of data security breaches involving their data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause the Company\u2019s customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of its data security measures. Any security breach whether actual or perceived, could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, could cause it to lose customers and may negatively impact its ability to acquire new customers.\nWith the increased use of technologies such as the Internet to conduct business, a company is susceptible to operational, information security and related risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyberattacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (e.g., through \u201chacking\u201d or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption (e.g., ransomware attacks). Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (i.e., efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber incidents affecting the Company or its service providers have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, interference with the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business in the ordinary course, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, additional compliance costs and, in extreme cases, have caused companies to cease doing business. Cyber events also can affect counterparties or entities with which the Company does business, governmental and other regulatory authorities, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, among others. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. While the Company has established risk management systems to prevent such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such systems including the possibility that the Company has not prepared for certain risks that have not been or are not possible to have been identified. Further, the Company may be able to influence, but cannot control, the cyber security plans and systems put in place by its service providers or any other third parties whose operations may affect the Company. The Company could be negatively impacted as a result.\nThe Company and its customers may be unable to keep current with the industry\u2019s technological changes.\nThe market for the Company\u2019s manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing product development. The future success of the Company\u2019s business will depend in large part upon our customers\u2019 ability to maintain and enhance their technological capabilities, develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nInternational Operations Risks\nThere is a risk of fluctuation of various currencies integral to the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company purchases some of its material components and funds some of its operations in foreign currencies. From time to time the currencies fluctuate against the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and performance. The impact of currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, resulted in net foreign currency transaction losses of $412,218 compared to net foreign currency losses of approximately $285,000 in the prior year. These fluctuations are expected to continue and could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company did not, and is not expected to, utilize derivatives or hedge foreign currencies to reduce the risk of such fluctuations.\nThe Company has foreign operations that may pose additional risks.\nThe Company has substantial manufacturing operations in multiple countries. Therefore, the Company\u2019s foreign businesses and results of operations are dependent upon numerous related factors, including the stability of the foreign economies, the political climate, relations with the United States, prevailing worker wages, the legal authority of the Company to operate and expand its business in a foreign country, the ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified personnel and operating management in Mexico, China and Vietnam, and the Company\u2019s ability to manage disruptions resulting from foreign government lockdowns and other actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company obtains many of its materials and components through its IPO in Taipei, Taiwan. The Company\u2019s access to these materials and components is dependent on the continued viability of its Asian suppliers.\nApproximately 35% of the total assets of the Company are located in foreign jurisdictions outside the United States as of April 30, 2022, 20% and 12% of the total assets were located in Mexico and China, respectively, and 3% in other foreign locations. As of April 30, 2021, approximately 39% of the total assets were located in foreign jurisdictions, 21% and 15% were located in China and Mexico, respectively and 3% in other foreign locations.\nThe Russian Conflict in the Ukraine and the resulting political, social and economic impacts may adversely affect our business.\nGenerally, the Company does not purchase components from Russia, Belarus, or the Ukraine. However, the semiconductor industry, and purchasers of semiconductors, use raw materials that are sourced from these regions, such as neon, palladium and nickel. If the Company, or its direct or indirect customers, are unable to obtain the requisite raw materials or components needed to manufacture products, the Company\u2019s ability to manufacture products, or demand for our products, may be adversely impacted. This could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. While there has been an adverse impact on the world\u2019s palladium and neon supply chains, at this time, our palladium and neon supply chains have been able to meet our needs. While sales of the Company\u2019s products into the regions, and to customers that sell into these regions, have been negatively impacted by the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, at this time, the Company has not experienced a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nGeneral Risks\nThe Company depends on management and skilled personnel.\nThe Company depends significantly on its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, President and other executive officers. The Company\u2019s employees generally are not bound by employment agreements and the Company cannot assure that it will retain its executive officers or skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of these key employees could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In addition, due to significant competition in the labor market, continued growth and expansion of the Company\u2019s EMS business will require that the Company attract, motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced personnel. The Company\u2019s future growth depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives and skilled, experienced employees. The Company\u2019s future growth also depends on its ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees. A failure to obtain or retain the number of skilled employees necessary to support the Company\u2019s efforts, a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of skilled, experienced employees could jeopardize its ability to meet its growth targets.\nFavorable labor relations are important to the Company, and failures to comply with domestic or international employment laws could result in significant damages.\nThe Company currently has labor union contracts with its employees constituting approximately 51% and 49% of its workforce for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Although the Company believes its labor relations are good, any labor disruptions, whether union-related or otherwise, could significantly impair the Company\u2019s business, substantially increase the Company\u2019s costs or otherwise have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company is also subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, wages, discrimination, harassment, organizing, employee privacy and severance. Allegations of violations of these laws could result in defense costs, damages, settlements and fines, which could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nInadequate internal control over financial reporting could result in a reduction in the value of our common stock.\nIf the Company identifies and reports a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, stockholders and the Company\u2019s lenders could lose confidence in the reliability of the Company\u2019s financial statements. This could have a material adverse impact on the value of the Company\u2019s stock and the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nDisclosure and internal controls may not detect all errors or fraud.\nThe Company\u2019s disclosure controls and internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance that the procedures will meet the control objectives. Controls are limited in their effectiveness by human error, including faulty judgments in decision-making. Further, controls can be circumvented by collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls. Therefore, the Company\u2019s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot conclude with certainty that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.", "PERMNO": 80274, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "SGMA"}
