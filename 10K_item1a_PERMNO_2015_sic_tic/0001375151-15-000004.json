{"cik": "1375151", "company": "ZOGENIX, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Pending Sale of the Zohydro ER Business to Pernix Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.\nThe announcement and pendency of the sale of our Zohydro ER business to affiliates of Pernix Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., or Pernix, could have an adverse effect on our stock price and/or our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe announcement and pendency of the sale of our Zohydro ER business to Pernix pursuant to the asset purchase agreement we entered into on March 10, 2015, or the asset purchase agreement, could disrupt our business in the following ways, among others:\n\u2022\nthird parties may determine to delay or defer purchase decisions with regard to Zohydro ER or terminate and/or attempt to renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the pending sale, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise; and\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management may be directed toward the completion of the pending sale and related matters, and their focus may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of our company, including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect our stock price or harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nObtaining required approvals necessary to satisfy the conditions to the completion of the sale of our Zohydro ER business to Pernix may delay or prevent completion of the pending sale.\nThe completion of the sale of our Zohydro ER business to Endo is conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or the HSR Act. We intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement. However, no assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained and, even if all such approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the asset purchase agreement.\nInability to complete the sale of our Zohydro ER business could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or our stock price.\nThe completion of the sale of our Zohydro business is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, clearance under the HSR Act, the receipt of any required third party consents and there not having been a material adverse effect with respect to such business, and there can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the pending sale will be satisfied. The asset purchase agreement may also be terminated by us and Pernix in certain specified circumstances, including if the sale has not been consummated by May 9, 2015 (subject to a 60-day extension in certain circumstances) due to an inability to satisfy any condition to closing. If the pending sale is not completed, we will be subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe current trading price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the sale will be completed;\n\u2022\nwe expect to incur substantial transaction costs in connection with the pending sale whether or not it is completed; and\n\u2022\nunder the asset purchase agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the pending sale, which restrictions could adversely affect our ability to realize certain of our business strategies or take advantage of certain business opportunities.\nIf the pending sale is not completed, these risks may materialize and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or our stock price.\nEven if we complete the sale of our Zohydro ER business, we may not realize the full economic benefit from such sale.\nPursuant to the asset purchase agreement, in addition to the $30.0 million upfront cash payment, we will also receive stock consideration of $20.0 million of Pernix\u2019s common stock and a secured promissory note for $50.0 million. We will not be permitted to sell such stock payable to us under the asset purchase agreement for six months, and the value of such stock is subject to change based on fluctuations in the market value of Pernix\u2019s common stock. In addition, since $50.0 million of the transaction consideration is in the form of a secured promissory note, there is also the risk that Pernix will default under the note, including its obligation to re-pay the note by its maturity date, in which case we can exercise our remedies to have the Zohydro ER business returned to us.\nWe may also receive contingent payments of up to $283.5 million, based on Pernix\u2019s achievement of pre-determined milestones, including a $12.5 million payment upon approval by the FDA of an abuse-deterrent extended-release hydrocodone tablet (currently in development in collaboration with Altus) and up to $271.0 million in potential sales milestone payments. Our ability to receive these contingent payments is dependent upon Pernix successfully maintaining and increasing market demand for, and sales of, Zohydro ER in a manner in which the requisite sales of the product will be achieved and devoting the resources necessary to achieve the manufacturing milestone.\nIn addition, we have agreed to indemnify Pernix and its affiliates against losses suffered as a result of our material breach of representations and warranties and our other obligations in the asset purchase agreement, and $3.0 million of the upfront cash payment will be deposited into escrow to fund such potential indemnification claims for a period of 12 months following the closing of the sale. An additional $7.0 million will be placed into the escrow fund upon repayment by Pernix of the secured promissory note to be issued under the asset purchase agreement. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify Pernix for certain indemnification matters up to an aggregate amount of $5.0 million. We cannot provide any assurance that we will receive all or any portion of the $10.0 million escrow amount or any of the contingent milestone payments.\nIf our pending sale of Zohydro ER to Pernix is consummated, our success will depend substantially on our product candidates, ZX008 and Relday. We cannot be certain that any product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nIf our pending sale of Zohydro ER to Pernix is consummated, we will have only a limited number of product candidates in development, and our business will depend substantially on their successful development and commercialization. Following the completion of the pending sale of Zohydro ER to Pernix, we will have no drug products approved for sale, and we may not be able to develop marketable drug products in the future. All of our product candidates will require additional clinical and non-clinical development, regulatory review and approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenues from product sales. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, whose regulations differ from country to country.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from the regulatory authorities of such countries, and we\nmay never receive such regulatory approvals. Obtaining regulatory approval for a product candidate is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and may not be obtained. Any failure to obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates would limit our ability to generate future revenues (and any failure to obtain such approval for all of the indications and labeling claims we deem desirable could reduce our potential revenue), would potentially harm the development prospects of our product candidates and would have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nEven if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, in part, on our ability to commercialize such products as well as the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval. If the markets for our product candidates are not as significant as we estimate, our business and prospects will be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of significant net losses and negative cash flow from operations. We cannot predict if or when we will become profitable and anticipate that our net losses and negative cash flow from operations will continue for at least the next year.\nWe were organized in 2006, began commercialization of Sumavel DosePro in January 2010 and launched the commercial sale of Zohydro ER in the United States in March 2014. Our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by pharmaceutical companies commercializing new products.\nWe have generated substantial net losses and negative cash flow from operations since our inception in 2006. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred net income (loss) of $8.6 million, $(80.9) million and $(47.4) million, respectively, our net cash used in operating activities was $(80.8) million, $(44.9) million and $(52.2) million, respectively, and, at December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $(401.7) million. We expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flow from operating activities for at least the next year primarily as a result of the expenses incurred in connection with the commercialization of Zohydro ER, including introduction of the new formulation of Zohydro ER with BeadTek, the development for ZX007, ZX008 (previously referred to as Brabafen, our recently acquired product candidate) and Relday, required FDA post-market required studies for Zohydro ER, safe use initiatives for Zohydro ER and additional development activities with respect to Zohydro ER, including the development of ZX007, which is an additional formulation with abuse deterrent properties. Our ability to generate revenues from sales of Zohydro ER, our Sumavel DosePro contract manufacturing services, or any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors including, in the case of Zohydro ER and Sumavel DosePro contract manufacturing services, the factors described in risk factors below and, in the case of our product candidates, including ZX007, ZX008 and Relday, our ability to successfully complete clinical trials, obtain necessary regulatory approvals and negotiate arrangements with third parties to help finance the development of, and market and distribute, any product candidates that receive regulatory approval. In addition, we are subject to the risk that the marketplace will not accept our products.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our commercialization and product development efforts, we are unable to predict the extent of our future losses or when or if we will become profitable and it is possible we will never become profitable. If we do not increase sales of Zohydro ER or generate significant sales from any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval, there would likely be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects which could result in our inability to continue operations.\nWe will require additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. To date, our operations have been primarily financed through the proceeds from the issuance of our common and preferred stock, including the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in November 2010, our follow-on public offerings completed in September 2011, July 2012 and November 2013, our controlled equity offering program, which was terminated in November 2013, and borrowings under financing agreements. In addition, we may fund our operations through the proceeds from the sales and issuances of our common stock, if any, pursuant to the controlled equity offering program that we established on November 6, 2014 with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, as sales agent, under which we may, from time to time, sell shares of common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $25.0 million. Sales of our common stock made pursuant to the controlled equity offering program, if any, will be made on the Nasdaq Global Market under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on November 6, 2014, which was declared effective on January 20, 2015. There can be no\nassurance that Cantor will be successful in consummating sales under the program based on prevailing market conditions or in the quantities or at the prices that we deem appropriate. Cantor or we are permitted to terminate the controlled equity offering sales agreement, or sales agreement, at any time upon 10 days' prior written notice, and Cantor is also permitted to terminate the sales agreement at any time in certain circumstances, including the occurrence of a material adverse change in our company.\nAlthough it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2014, the $8.5 million of the upfront cash payment received from the sale of our Sumavel DosePro business that is included in restricted cash, availability of funds under our revolving line of credit, our projected product revenues from Zohydro ER, the $5.0 million in remaining payments due for the exclusivity waiver granted to Purdue Pharma L.P. due by July 1, 2015, and our projected manufacturing and other service revenues will be sufficient to fund our operations through the third quarter of 2015. We may need to obtain additional funds to finance our operations beyond that point, or possibly earlier, in order to:\n\u2022\nmaintain our sales and marketing activities for Zohydro ER;\n\u2022\nfund our operations and fund required FDA post-market studies of Zohydro ER and additional development activities with respect to Zohydro ER, including the development of Zohydro ER with abuse deterrent properties, as well as further development of ZX008 and Relday and development of any other product candidates to support potential regulatory approval; and\n\u2022\ncommercialize Zohydro ER with abuse deterrent properties or any of our other product candidates, or any products or product candidates that we may develop, in-license or otherwise acquire, if any such product candidates receive regulatory approval.\nIn addition, our estimates of the amount of cash necessary to fund our business and development and commercialization activities may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of Zohydro ER;\n\u2022\nthe costs of maintaining our sales and marketing infrastructure or establishing distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other product development programs for ZX008, Relday and our other product candidates and any other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire;\n\u2022\nthe timing of regulatory approval for any of our other product candidates and the commercial success of any approved products\n\u2022\nthe receipt of contingent payments from the sale of our Sumavel DosePro business, which are based on the achievement of pre-determined sales and gross margin milestones by Endo Health Solutions Inc., or Endo;\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with Zohydro ER, our DosePro technology, ZX008, Relday and any of our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of completion of outsourced commercial manufacturing supply arrangements for any product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any additional collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and cash flow from operations and achieve profitability, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, receivables financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional required funds, we may be required to significantly delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs or our commercialization efforts, or cease operating as a going concern. We also may be required to relinquish, license or otherwise dispose of rights to product\ncandidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, substantial dilution to existing stockholders would result. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business. If we are unable to maintain sufficient financial resources, including by raising additional funds when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn its report accompanying our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities or commercial bank loans. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend, in large part, on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations and obtain additional financing, neither of which is certain. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized and we may not be able to continue operations and may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our consolidated financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment.\nWe are largely dependent on the commercial success of Zohydro ER, and although we have generated revenue from sales of Zohydro ER, it is still early in the commercialization process and we may never significantly increase these sales or become profitable.\nOur ability to generate revenues and become profitable will depend in large part on the commercial success of Zohydro ER. We launched the commercial sale of Zohydro ER in the United States in March 2014 and expect to launch Zohydro ER with BeadTek in the second quarter of 2015. The commercial success of Zohydro ER depends on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully launch and educate prescribers on Zohydro ER's efficacy and safety, as well as our safe use initiatives, through our own marketing and sales activities;\n\u2022\ncreate market demand for Zohydro ER through our own marketing and sales activities, and any other arrangements to promote this product that we may later establish;\n\u2022\ncommercialize Zohydro ER with BeadTek and successfully develop and commercialize ZX007;\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain adequate levels of coverage for Zohydro ER from commercial health plans and government health programs, which we refer to collectively as third-party payors, particularly in light of the availability of other branded and generic competitive products;\n\u2022\nmaintain compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain agreements with wholesalers and distributors on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nmaintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers as necessary to meet commercial demand for Zohydro ER and manufacture commercial quantities at acceptable cost levels; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully maintain intellectual property protection for Zohydro ER.\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize Zohydro ER, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to grow or sustain our business and we may never become profitable, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nIf Zohydro ER, Zohydro ER with BeadTek, ZX007, ZX008, Relday or any other product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval does not achieve broad market acceptance or coverage by third-party payors, the revenues that we generate will be limited.\nThe commercial success of Zohydro ER, Zohydro ER with BeadTek, ZX007, ZX008, Relday or any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon the acceptance of these products by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our approved product by third-party payors is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of Zohydro ER and any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nany negative publicity or political action related to our or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which a product is approved;\n\u2022\nin the case of Zohydro ER and product candidates that are controlled substances, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, scheduling classification;\n\u2022\navailability and perceived advantages of alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our or any current or future collaborators\u2019 sales, marketing and distribution strategies;\n\u2022\npricing and cost effectiveness;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain sufficient third-party payor coverage and reimbursement; and\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out of pocket in the absence of third-party payor coverage.\nFor example, as part of its own initiatives to address the safety risks associated with opioid analgesics, in September 2013, the FDA announced class-wide safety labeling changes, including required new boxed warnings and new post-market study requirements for all extended-release, or ER, and long-acting, or LA, opioid analgesics intended to treat chronic pain. Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, even at recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death, the FDA determined that this class of drugs should be reserved for management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. In addition, the FDA required the drug companies that make these drugs to work together to design and conduct further studies and clinical trials to assess the known serious risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and death , as well as evaluate the possibility of causing an increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) with chronic administration. The scope and design of these required additional studies and clinical trials are under development and the related cost is currently unknown, which could negatively affect our business. The FDA held a public meeting in May 2014 to obtain stakeholder input on the design and conduct of the post-marketing requirements for ER/LA opioid analgesic drug products and is using this input to provide feedback to the companies on these post marketing study requirements. We cannot predict how the results of these post-marketing required studies will affect the commercialization of Zohydro ER and future formulations of Zohydro ER with abuse deterrent properties.\nControlled substances are classified by the DEA as Schedule I through V substances, with Schedule I substances being prohibited for sale in the United States, Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances being considered to present the lowest relative risk of abuse. Zohydro ER contains hydrocodone and is regulated as a Schedule II controlled substance, and despite the strict regulations on the marketing, prescribing and dispensing of such substances, illicit use and abuse of hydrocodone, like all other opioid medications, is well-documented. Because the United States has had an epidemic of opioid abuse, misuse, and diversion for over a decade, the FDA approval and subsequent marketing of Zohydro ER did generate public controversy that adversely affected the market acceptance of Zohydro ER in 2014. Due to the concerns regarding abuse of opioids like Zohydro ER, we are developing formulations of Zohydro ER designed to have abuse deterrent properties. We filed an sNDA on September 30, 2014 for a next-generation formulation of Zohydro ER that is designed using safe, well-known excipients and proprietary manufacturing processes to create an inactive\ningredient that immediately forms a viscous gel when crushed or dissolved in liquids or solvents. This formulation was approved by the FDA for marketing on January 30, 2015, and we anticipate a transition from the currently marketed product to this new capsule formulation of Zohydro ER in the second quarter of 2015, at which time this new formulation (Zohydro ER with BeadTek) will be available to prescribers.\nFurther, we are targeting an NDA submission for a proprietary tablet formulation of a single entity extended-release hydrocodone (ZX007) during the first half of 2016 which incorporates multiple features to maintain the extended-release property of the medication when crushed or chewed, reducing one of the ways in which opioids are abused through oral ingestion, as well other features to address abuse by injection or nasal administration.\nOur efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of Zohydro ER and formulations of Zohydro ER with abuse deterrent properties, ZX008, Relday or any of our other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities and gain broad market acceptance may require significant resources and may never be successful. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, third-party payors, pharmacists, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products to become or remain profitable.\nNegative publicity and political action regarding Zohydro ER could delay or impair our ability to market this product, present significant distractions to our management and result in the incurrence of significant costs.\nProducts used to treat and manage pain, especially in the case of opioids like Zohydro ER, are from time to time subject to negative publicity, including political influences, illegal use, overdoses, abuse, diversion, serious injury and death. In November 2013, eight members of Congress submitted a letter to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, urging reconsideration of the FDA\u2019s approval of Zohydro ER, and in December 2013, a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from 29 states and territories submitted a letter to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg with the same request. In April 2014, Purdue Pharma, L.P., or Purdue, announced that it filed an NDA for its extended-release hydrocodone product candidate that is formulated to incorporate abuse deterrent properties, which was accepted by the FDA in July 2014 for a priority review. On October 29, 2014, we entered into a mutual exclusivity waiver agreement with Purdue, pursuant to which we granted a waiver to Purdue, of the three-year Hatch-Waxman regulatory exclusivity period with respect to NDA 202880 for Zohydro ER in support of the Purdue Products. In addition, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited announced that the FDA has accepted their NDA submission as of February 2015. Approval of these product candidates or any abuse-deterrent formulation of hydrocodone may drive further negative publicity and political action, or even result in the FDA revoking its approval of our NDA for Zohydro ER. While we do not believe that the FDA will revoke its Zohydro ER approval, and, in any event, the FDA would have to provide us with notice and opportunity for a hearing first, the related negative publicity, political influences and actions by our competitors could negatively affect our ability to market Zohydro ER and any opioid analgesic product candidates for which we may seek approval in the future. If the FDA did revoke its approval of Zohydro ER, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, in March 2014, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts issued an executive order to ban Zohydro ER in Massachusetts. In response, in April 2014 we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts requesting that the court preliminarily enjoin implementation of Governor Patrick\u2019s executive order prohibiting the prescribing and dispensing of Zohydro ER. The lawsuit asserted that the executive order was in direct conflict with the authority of the FDA to determine on behalf of the public whether a drug is safe and effective, and to impose the measures necessary to ensure that such drug will be used safely and appropriately. After the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts entered the requested preliminary injunction preventing the implementation of the Governor\u2019s order on constitutional grounds, the Commonwealth adopted emergency regulations which restricted distribution of Zohydro ER in Massachusetts. We challenged these emergency regulations as preempted by the FDA approval for Zohydro ER, and the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on July 8 agreed that implementation of the emergency regulations also should be preliminarily enjoined. In the interim, Massachusetts has issued final regulations also imposing certain restrictions on distribution of Zohydro ER, and we have challenged these final regulations in the court proceeding. While we believe the FDA has the authority to determine on behalf of the public whether a drug is safe and effective and to impose the measures necessary to ensure that such drug will be used safely and appropriately, and the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts has ruled in our favor, state officials in Massachusetts or elsewhere may nevertheless seek to place additional restrictions on the prescribing and use of Zohydro ER, which could negatively affect our ability to market Zohydro ER.\nThis negative publicity and political action could also cause a diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention, cause us to incur additional significant costs with respect to litigation, marketing or otherwise, and could also result in an increased number of product liability claims, whether or not these claims have a valid basis.\nOur short operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe commenced our operations on August 25, 2006. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, scaling up manufacturing operations with our third-party contract manufacturers, building a sales and marketing organization, conducting product development activities for our products and product candidates, in-licensing rights to Zohydro ER and Relday, acquiring rights to ZX008 and commercializing Sumavel DosePro and Zohydro ER. In January 2010, we launched Sumavel DosePro and began generating revenues. We launched Zohydro ER in March 2014 and sold our Sumavel DosePro business in April 2014. Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer history of developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nWe depend on wholesale pharmaceutical distributors for retail distribution of Zohydro ER, and if we lose any of our significant wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, our business could be harmed.\nThe majority of our sales of Zohydro ER are to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors who, in turn, sell the products to pharmacies, hospitals and other customers. Three wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., individually comprised 33.0%, 32.0% and 23.0%, respectively, of our total ex-factory gross product sales of Zohydro ER for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSales to these wholesale pharmaceutical distributors may result in substantial fluctuations in our results of operations from period to period and the loss of any of these wholesale pharmaceutical distributors' accounts or a material reduction in their purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, these wholesale customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the United States. This distribution network has undergone, and may continue to undergo, significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions. As a result, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market. Consolidation of drug wholesalers has increased, and may continue to increase, competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical products. In addition, at times, wholesaler purchases may exceed customer demand, resulting in reduced wholesaler purchases in later quarters, which may result in substantial fluctuations in our results of operations from period to period. We cannot assure you that we can manage these pricing pressures or that wholesaler purchases will not decrease as a result of this potential excess buying.\nOur sales can be greatly affected by the inventory levels our wholesalers carry. We monitor wholesaler inventory of Zohydro ER using a combination of methods. Pursuant to distribution service agreements with our three largest wholesale customers, we receive inventory level reports. For most other wholesalers where we do not receive inventory level reports, however, our estimates of wholesaler inventories may differ significantly from actual inventory levels. Significant differences between actual and estimated inventory levels may result in excessive production (requiring us to hold substantial quantities of unsold inventory), inadequate supplies of products in distribution channels, insufficient product available at the retail level, and unexpected increases or decreases in orders from our wholesalers. These changes may cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and in some cases may cause our operating results for a particular quarter to be below our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If our financial results are below expectations for a particular period, the market price of our common stock may drop significantly.\nWe face intense competition, including from generic products, and if our competitors market and/or develop treatments for Dravet syndrome, pain or psychiatric disorders that are marketed more effectively, approved more quickly than our product candidates or demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our products, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our products or product candidates, including large pharmaceutical companies, smaller pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, sales and marketing capabilities, including larger, well-established sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than we do.\nZohydro ER competes against other marketed branded and generic pain therapeutics. Opioid therapeutics generally fall into two classes: immediate-release and extended-release/long acting opioids. Zohydro ER is an extended-release form of hydrocodone, the most commonly prescribed opioid in the United States, and Zohydro ER competes with\ntherapeutics within the extended-release/long acting class. These therapeutics are all Schedule III products (meaning that they are considered controlled substances by the DEA) being marketed by companies such as Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Mallinckrodt, Pfizer, Purdue, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, Depomed, Inc. and Actavis. On August 22, 2014, the DEA issued a final rule to reschedule all immediate-release hydrocodone combination products from Schedule III to Schedule II. The rescheduling went into effect on October 6, 2014 and requires previously classified Schedule III immediate-release hydrocodone combination products to comply with more restrictive regulatory requirements under Schedule II classification. Zohydro ER is already a Schedule II product.\nZohydro ER may also face competition from non-opioid product candidates including new chemical entities, as well as alternative delivery forms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These new opioid and non-opioid product candidates are being developed by companies such as Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hospira Inc., Inspirion Delivery Technologies, LLC, Intellipharmaceutics International, Inc., Nektar Therapeutics, Pfizer and QRxPharma Ltd.\nIf approved for the chronic treatment of Dravet syndrome, ZX008 may compete against other product candidates. Epidiolex, which is being developed by GW Pharmaceuticals, has received an orphan designation by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and fast track status by the FDA for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. In October 2014, GW Pharmaceuticals initiated a Phase 2/3 clinical trial for Epidiolex, a cannabanoid drug. Insys Therapeutics has advanced its pharmaceutical cannabinoid program, which has received orphan drug designation and fast track status by the FDA for use of cannabidiol as a potential treatment for Dravet syndrome. Sage Therapeutics is developing its lead compound SAGE-547, an allosteric modulator of GABA receptors, for the acute treatment of super-refractory status epilepticus, which are acute prolonged seizures that can be associated with Dravet syndrome, as well as other seizure conditions.\nIf approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, we anticipate that Relday will compete against other marketed, branded and generic, typical and atypical antipsychotics, including both long-acting injectable and oral products. Currently marketed long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotic products include Risperdal Consta and Invega Sustenna marketed by Johnson & Johnson, Zyprexa Relprevv marketed by Eli Lilly & Company, and Abilify Maintena (apripiprazole) marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and H. Lundbeck A/S. Currently approved and marketed oral atypical antipsychotics include Risperdal (risperidone) and Invega (paliperidone) marketed by Johnson & Johnson, generic risperidone, Zyprexa (olanzapine) marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, Seroquel (quetiapine) marketed by AstraZeneca plc, Abilify (aripiprazole) marketed by BMS/Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Geodon (ziprasidone) marketed by Pfizer, Fanapt (iloperidone) marketed by Novartis AG, Saphris (asenapine) marketed by Merck & Co., Latuda (lurasidone) marketed by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, and generic clozapine. Finally, in addition to these currently marketed products, we may also face competition from additional long-acting injectable product candidates that could be developed by the large companies listed above, as well and by other pharmaceutical companies such as Alkermes, Endo Health Solutions Inc., Laboratorios Farmaceuticos Rovi SA, Novartis AG, and Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, each of which has announced they are developing long-acting antipsychotic product candidates. In May 2014, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., announced the submission of sNDAs for once-monthly atypical long-acting antipsychotic Invega Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate) to the FDA for approval to treat schizoaffective disorder as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy.\nWe expect Zohydro ER and, if approved, ZX007, ZX008, Relday and any of our other product candidates to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, patient reimbursement by third-party payors, extent of adverse side effects and convenience of treatment procedures. One or more of our competitors may develop injectable products, products to address chronic pain or other products that compete with ours, obtain necessary approvals for such products from the FDA, or other agencies, if required, more rapidly than we do or develop alternative products or therapies that are safer, more effective and/or more cost effective than any products developed by us. The competition that we will encounter with respect to any of our product candidates that receive the requisite regulatory approval and classification and are marketed will have, and the competition we are currently encountering with Zohydro ER has had and will continue to have, an effect on our product prices, market share and results of operations. We may not be able to differentiate any products that we are able to market from those of our competitors, successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly or offer better results than those of our competitors, or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors.\nIn addition, competitors may seek to develop alternative formulations of our product candidates and/or alternative drug delivery technologies that address our targeted indications. On August 13 and September 20, 2014, we received separate notices of paragraph IV certifications from Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc., or Actavis, and from Alvogen Pine Brook, Inc., or Alvogen, respectively, advising us of the filing of Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, with\nthe FDA for a generic version of Zohydro ER. These certification notices allege that the two U.S. patents listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book for Zohydro ER, each with an expiration date in November 2019, will not be infringed by Actavis' or Alvogen\u2019s proposed products, are invalid and/or are unenforceable. On September 3, 2014, Daravita filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Actavis, and on November 3, 2014, Daravita filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Alvogen. Daravita has licensed rights to Zohydro ER to us, and, under the Zohydro ER license agreement, Daravita has the right to control the enforcement of patents and related proceedings involving Zohydro ER and any prospective generic entrant. We intend to vigorously enforce the intellectual property rights relating to Zohydro ER, but we cannot predict the outcome of these matters or guarantee the outcome of any litigation.\nThe commercial opportunity for Zohydro ER and our product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop alternative formulations and/or drug delivery technologies outside the scope of our products. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n\u2022\ncapital resources;\n\u2022\nresearch and development resources and experience, including personnel and technology;\n\u2022\ndrug development, clinical trial and regulatory resources and experience;\n\u2022\nsales and marketing resources and experience;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing and distribution resources and experience;\n\u2022\nname recognition; and\n\u2022\nresources, experience and expertise in prosecution and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit or block us from developing or commercializing our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more useful, better tolerated, subject to fewer or less severe side effects, more widely prescribed or accepted or less costly than ours and may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively with the marketed therapeutics of our competitors or if such competitors are successful in developing products that compete with Zohydro ER or any of our product candidates that are approved, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nFrom time to time we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing or in-licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. For example, in October 2014, we completed the acquisition of Brabant, which owns worldwide development and commercialization rights to ZX008 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges;\n\u2022\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u2022\ninability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any additional transactions of the nature described above, any additional transactions that we do complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nAlthough we have been granted three-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity for Zohydro ER, we have entered into a waiver agreement with Purdue of the three-year Hatch-Waxman regulatory exclusivity period with respect to NDA 202880 for Zohydro ER in support of the Purdue Products and can offer no assurance that such exclusivity will effectively prevent or otherwise limit further competition from other hydrocodone products, either generic or otherwise.\nIn addition to patent protection, we rely, in part, on Hatch-Waxman marketing exclusivity for the commercialization of Zohydro ER in the United States. Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, newly approved drugs may benefit from certain statutory periods of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States. Exclusivity provides the holder of an approved application limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug product.\nA three-year period of exclusivity is available for a drug product that contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved and the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were essential to approval of the application. Changes to an approved drug product that may qualify for this exclusivity include changes that affect the product\u2019s active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form, route of administration, or conditions of use, so long as clinical investigations were essential to approval of the application containing those changes. The exclusivity prevents FDA from approving other applications for the same change for three years from the date of the new product\u2019s approval.\nWhile Zohydro ER has been granted three-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity as the first single-entity hydrocodone product approved for the treatment of chronic pain on the basis of a comprehensive Phase 3 safety and efficacy program, there can be no assurance that such exclusivity will effectively prevent or otherwise limit competition from other hydrocodone products, either generic or otherwise. On October 29, 2014, we entered into a waiver agreement with Purdue, pursuant to which we granted a waiver to Purdue of the three-year Hatch-Waxman regulatory exclusivity period with respect to NDA 202880 for Zohydro ER in support of the Purdue Products (as defined in the waiver agreement). On November 20, 2014, Purdue announced the FDA had approved its product Hysingla ER\u00ae. Such competition by the Purdue Products and other hydrocodone products, including other 505(b)(2) applications for different conditions of use or other changes to the hydrocodone products that would not be restricted by the three-year exclusivity, could have a significantly negative impact on our future revenues from Zohydro ER.\nWe are dependent on numerous third parties in our supply chain, all of which are currently single source suppliers, for the commercial supply of Sumavel DosePro and Zohydro ER and for the clinical supply of ZX008 and Relday, and if we experience problems with any of these suppliers, the manufacturing of Sumavel DosePro, Zohydro ER, ZX008 and Relday could be delayed.\nWhile we own most of the specialized equipment used to manufacture critical components of Sumavel DosePro, we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and currently lack the in-house capability to manufacture Sumavel DosePro, Zohydro ER, ZX008, Relday or any other product candidates. Our DosePro system and Sumavel DosePro are manufactured by contract manufacturers, component fabricators and secondary service providers. Aseptic fill, finish, assembly and packaging of Sumavel DosePro are performed at Patheon UK Limited, Swindon, United Kingdom, or Patheon, a specialist in the aseptic fill/finish of injectables and other sterile pharmaceutical products. In addition to Patheon's manufacturing services, Nypro Limited, located in Bray, Ireland, manufactures the actuator assemblies and injection molded components for our DosePro system and Nipro Glass, Germany AG (formerly MGlas AG), located in M\u00fcnnerstadt, Germany, manufactures the specialized glass capsule (cartridge) that houses the sumatriptan API in our DosePro system. Each of these manufacturers and each other company that supplies, fabricates or manufactures any component used in our DosePro system is currently the only qualified source of their respective components. We currently rely on Dr. Reddy's Laboratories as the only supplier of sumatriptan API for use in Sumavel DosePro. Daravita is the\nexclusive manufacturer and supplier (subject to certain exceptions) for Zohydro ER. We also outsource all manufacturing and packaging of the clinical trial materials for ZX008 and Relday to third parties.\nAlthough we plan to qualify additional manufacturers and suppliers of some of the components used in Sumavel DosePro, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so and the current manufacturers and suppliers of these components will likely be single source suppliers to us for a significant period of time. Similarly, Daravita is the exclusive manufacturer of Zohydro ER and Durect is the exclusive manufacturer of the risperidone formulation using Durect's SABER\u2122 controlled-release technology for all Relday clinical trials through Phase 2 and has the option to supply the same formulation for Phase 3 clinical trials and, if approved, commercial production. ZX008, if approved, would require a technology transfer to an alternate source to establish commercial supply capabilities, for which there can be no assurance of a successful transfer and validation. We have restrictions on establishing a second source of supply under our agreement with Daravita, and we may never be able to establish additional sources of supply for Zohydro ER, ZX008 or Relday's risperidone formulation.\nManufacturers and suppliers are subject to regulatory requirements covering, among other things, manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to our products and product candidates, and are subject to ongoing inspections by regulatory agencies. Failure by any of our manufacturers or suppliers to comply with applicable regulations may result in long delays and interruptions to our manufacturing supply, and increase our costs, while we seek to secure another supplier who meets all regulatory requirements, including obtaining regulatory approval to utilize the new manufacturer or supplier. Accordingly, the loss of any of our current third-party manufacturers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured Sumavel DosePro, Zohydro ER or our product candidates ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control or the insolvency of any of these third parties or other financial difficulties, labor unrest, natural disasters or other factors adversely affecting their ability to conduct their business; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility of termination or non-renewal of the agreements by the third parties, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us, because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities.\nProduction capacity to support launch and initial forecast demand for Zohydro ER is installed and has received final packaging qualification. In order to meet future anticipated growth in demand for Zohydro ER, Daravita has initiated activities to qualify additional production lines and expand the manufacturing capacity for Zohydro ER. However, if Daravita or our other contract manufacturers or suppliers are unable to deliver the required commercial quantities of our products and their various components, the quantities of our product candidates required for our clinical trials and, if approved, for commercial sale, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers or suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality, and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and would have to delay or terminate our pre-clinical or clinical trials, and we would lose potential revenue. It may also take a significant period of time to establish an alternative source of supply for our products, product candidates and components and to have any such new source approved by the FDA or any applicable foreign regulatory authorities. Furthermore, any of the above factors could cause the delay or suspension of initiation or completion of clinical trials, regulatory submissions or required approvals of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates successfully.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, and we cannot give any assurance that any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nWe currently are developing ZX007, an abuse deterrent tablet formulation of single entity, extended-release hydrocodone, ZX008 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, and Relday for the treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of drug products, among other things, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States. We are not permitted to market ZX007, ZX008, Relday or any of our other product candidates in the United States unless and until we receive regulatory approval from the FDA. We cannot provide any assurance that we will obtain regulatory\napproval for any of our product candidates, or that any such product candidates will be successfully commercialized.\nUnder the policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as renewed in 2012 by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, the FDA is subject to a two-tiered system of review times for new drugs: standard review and priority review. For drugs subject to standard review that do not contain a new molecular entity, such as Relday, the FDA has a goal to complete its review of the NDA and respond to the applicant within ten months from the date of receipt of an NDA. The review process and the PDUFA target action date may be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA's review goals are subject to change, and the duration of the FDA's review may depend on the number and type of other NDAs that are submitted to the FDA around the same time period.\nThe FDA may also refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the matters discussed at the advisory committee meeting, and in particular any concerns regarding safety, could limit our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates subject to advisory committee review.\nAs part of its review of an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the drug is manufactured. If the FDA's evaluations of the NDA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA will issue an action letter, which will be either an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for a specified indication, or a Complete Response Letter containing the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval of the NDA. These conditions may include deficiencies identified in connection with the FDA's evaluation of the NDA submission or the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities. Until any such conditions or deficiencies have been resolved, the FDA may refuse to approve the NDA. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. For example:\n\u2022 the FDA may not deem a product candidate safe and effective;\n\u2022 the FDA may not find the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials sufficient to support approval;\n\u2022 the FDA may require additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022 the FDA may not approve of our third-party manufacturers' processes and facilities; or\n\u2022 the FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nProduct candidates such as ZX007, ZX008, and Relday and any of our other product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their specified endpoints in clinical trials. The FDA may disagree with our trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials. The FDA may also approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request, or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-approval clinical trials. In addition, the FDA may not approve the labeling claims that we believe are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Approval may be contingent on a REMS, which limits the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. For example, the approval of our NDA for Zohydro ER was associated with post-market study and REMS requirements due to the risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and death associated with the active ingredient hydrocodone.\nZX007, ZX008, Relday and any of our other product candidates may not achieve their specified endpoints in clinical trials. The safety and effectiveness of ZX008 has been evaluated in a continuing, long-term, open-label, study in 15 Dravet syndrome patients at a single academic medical center site in Belgium. Based upon feedback from the FDA and the EMA we expect to initiate two Phase 3 studies (of 40 to 60 Dravet syndrome patients per study) during the third quarter of 2015 in the United States and Europe, with top-line results potentially available in the first half of 2016. We initiated a Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic clinical trial for Relday in July 2012 and announced positive single-dose pharmacokinetic results from this trial in January 2013. Based on the favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile demonstrated with the 25 mg and 50 mg once-monthly doses tested in the Phase 1 trial, we extended the study to include an additional cohort of 10 patients at a 100 mg dose of the same formulation and announced positive top-line results from\nthe extended Phase 1 clinical trial in May 2013. The positive results from this study extension positioned us to begin a multi-dose clinical trial, which will provide the required steady-state pharmacokinetic and safety data prior to initiating Phase 3 development studies. We started this multi-dose clinical trial in the first half of 2015 with top-line results potentially available in the second half of 2015.\nIf we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for ZX007, ZX008, Relday or any other product candidates on the timeline we anticipate, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively and our ability to generate additional revenues beyond Zohydro ER may be limited.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety and efficacy for ZX007, ZX008, Relday or any of our other product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval.\nZX007, ZX008, Relday and any of our other product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. Before obtaining U.S. regulatory approval for the commercial sale of ZX008, Relday or any other product candidate, we must gather substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials that demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that the product candidate is safe and effective, and similar regulatory approvals would be necessary to commercialize our product candidates in other countries.\nIn light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, particularly opioid drug products, regulatory authorities, members of Congress, the Government Accountability Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and establishment of risk management programs that may, for instance, restrict distribution of drug products after approval.\nThe increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA in its review of our clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to terminate clinical trials before completion, or require longer or additional clinical trials that may result in a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought. A number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. If ZX007, ZX008, Relday or any of our other product candidates are not shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials, the programs could be delayed or terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing for ZX007, ZX008, Relday or pre-clinical or clinical testing for any of our other product candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to pursue regulatory approval for, or generate revenues from, such product candidates.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing for ZX007, ZX008, Relday or pre-clinical or clinical testing for any of our other product candidates could significantly affect our product development costs and business plan.\nThe safety and effectiveness of ZX008 has been evaluated in a continuing, long-term, open-label, study in 15 Dravet syndrome patients. Based upon feedback from the FDA and the EMA, we expect to initiate two Phase 3 studies (of 40 to 60 Dravet syndrome patients per study) during the third quarter of 2015 in the United States and Europe, with top-line results potentially available in the first half of 2016. We do not know whether any of our other pre-clinical or clinical trials will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all.\nWe initiated clinical testing for Relday in patients with schizophrenia in July 2012 and announced positive single-dose pharmacokinetic results from the Phase 1 clinical trial in January 2013. Based on the favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile demonstrated in the Phase 1 trial, we extended the study to include an additional dose of the same formulation and announced positive top-line results in May 2013. The results for the extended Phase 1 clinical trial showed risperidone blood concentrations in the therapeutic range were achieved on the first day of dosing and maintained throughout the one-month period. In addition, dose proportionality was demonstrated across the full dose range studied. In February 2015, we began a multi-dose clinical trial, which we believe will provide the required steady-state pharmacokinetic and safety data prior to initiating Phase 3 development studies.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory authorization to commence a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, clinical investigators and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs, clinical investigators and trial sites;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing or obtaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtaining IRB approval to initiate and conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting and enrolling subjects to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including competition from other clinical trial programs for the treatment of similar indications;\n\u2022\nretaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy, personal issues, or for any other reason they choose, or who are lost to further follow-up;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding proper dosing; and\n\u2022\nscheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions.\nIn addition, if a significant number of patients fail to stay enrolled in any of our current or future clinical trials of ZX008, Relday or any of our other product candidates and such failure is not adequately accounted for in our trial design and enrollment assumptions, our clinical development program could be delayed. Clinical trials may also be delayed or repeated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or unforeseen complications in testing. In addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, the IRB overseeing the clinical trial at issue, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ninability to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\ninability by us, our employees, our CROs or their employees to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with all applicable FDA, DEA or other regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022\ninspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u2022\ndiscovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by study participants or other unforeseen safety issues;\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies and increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs and other third parties;\n\u2022\nlack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability of our CROs or other third-party contractors to comply with all contractual requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u2022\nunfavorable results from on-going clinical trials and pre-clinical studies.\nAdditionally, changes in applicable regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience\ndelays in completion of, or if we terminate, any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for ZX008, Relday and our other product candidates may be harmed, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe conducted prior clinical trials under agreements with third-party CROs, and we anticipate that we may enter into agreements with third-party CROs in the future regarding ZX008, Relday or any of our other product candidates. We rely heavily on these parties for the execution of our clinical and pre-clinical studies, and control only certain aspects of their activities.\nNevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and regulatory requirements. We and our CROs are required to comply with current GCP. The FDA enforces these GCP regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP regulations, the data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA and similar foreign regulators will determine that any of our clinical trials comply or complied with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations, and require a large number of test subjects. Our inability to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate additional revenues could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur inability to successfully establish new partnerships with pharmaceutical companies or contract sales organizations to co-promote Zohydro ER and any additional product candidates that may receive regulatory approval may impair our ability to effectively market and sell such product candidates.\nMajor pharmaceutical companies usually employ groups of sales representatives numbering in the thousands to call on the large number of primary care physicians. Our sales and marketing organization, which as of December 31, 2014 was comprised of approximately 149 personnel, promotes Zohydro ER in the United States, primarily targeting pain specialists. We may seek a co-promotion or other partnering opportunity for Zohydro ER, or may further expand our sales force.\nIn addition, in order to promote any product candidates that receive regulatory approval, we may need to further expand our sales and marketing personnel and commercial infrastructure and/or establish partnerships with pharmaceutical companies or contract sales organizations to co-promote such additional products. We currently, and on an ongoing basis will have to, compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. We also face competition in our search for collaborators and potential co-promoters. To the extent we rely on additional third parties to co-promote or otherwise commercialize any products and/or product candidates that may receive regulatory approval, we are likely to receive less revenue than if we commercialized these products ourselves. Further, by entering into strategic partnerships or similar arrangements, we may rely in part on such third parties for financial and commercialization resources. Even if we are able to identify suitable partners to assist in the commercialization of our products and/or product candidates, they may be unable to devote the resources necessary to realize the full commercial potential of our products.\nFurther, we may lack the financial and managerial resources to maintain and potentially increase the size of our sales and marketing organization to adequately promote and commercialize Zohydro ER and any product candidates that may be approved. Any increase in our sales force will result in an increase in our expenses, which could be significant before we generate revenues from any newly approved product candidate. Even though we were able to recently expand our sales and marketing personnel, and may be successful in establishing future partnership arrangements, such sales force and marketing teams may not be successful in commercializing our products, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue for such products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may encounter delays in the manufacturing of Sumavel DosePro or fail to generate contract manufacturing revenue if our supply of the components of our DosePro drug delivery system is interrupted .\nOur DosePro drug delivery system is sourced, manufactured and assembled by multiple third parties across different geographic locations in Europe, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Ireland. All contract manufacturers and component suppliers have been selected for their specific competencies in the manufacturing processes and materials that make up the DosePro system. The components of DosePro include the actuator subassembly, capsule subassembly and the setting mechanism. The actuator subassembly is comprised of nine individual components which are collectively supplied by six different third-party manufacturers. The capsule subassembly that houses the sterile drug formulation sumatriptan is comprised of five different components also supplied by four third-party manufacturers. Each of these third-party manufacturers is currently the single source of their respective components. If any of these manufacturers is unable to supply its respective component for any reason, including due to violations of the FDA\u2019s QSR requirements, our ability to manufacture the finished DosePro system will be adversely affected and our ability to meet the distribution requirements for any Sumavel DosePro purchase orders from Endo and the resulting contract manufacturing revenue therefrom will be negatively affected. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any failure in any part of our supply chain will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate contract manufacturing revenue from Sumavel DosePro or our ability to generate revenue from any potential future DosePro products, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on third parties to perform many necessary services for our commercial products, including services related to the distribution, invoicing, storage and transportation of our products, as well as the performance of services to support our safe use initiatives for Zohydro ER.\nWe have retained third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the sale and distribution of our products, key aspects of which are out of our direct control. For example, we rely on Cardinal Health 105, Inc. (a/k/a Specialty Pharmaceutical Services) to provide key services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, distribution, contract administration and chargeback processing, accounts receivable management and call center management, and, as a result, most of our inventory is stored at a single warehouse maintained by the service provider. We also rely on Inmar Inc. to process our product returns. We place substantial reliance on these providers as well as other third-party providers that perform services for us, including entrusting our inventories of products to their care and handling. If these third-party service providers are unable to comply with applicable laws and regulations, are unable to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, or encounter physical damage or natural disaster at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired.\nIn addition, we utilize other third parties to perform various other services for us relating to drug safety monitoring and surveillance, sample accountability and regulatory monitoring, including adverse event reporting, education regarding the safe use of our products, safety database management and other product maintenance services. If the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient, our ability to continue to market our products could be jeopardized or we could be subject to regulatory sanctions. We do not currently have the internal capacity to perform these important commercial functions, and we may not be able to maintain commercial arrangements for these services on reasonable terms.\nWe may not realize the full economic benefit from the sale of our Sumavel DosePro business.\nPursuant to the asset purchase agreement with Endo that we entered into in April 2014, or the asset purchase agreement, in addition to the $89.6 million upfront cash payment, we may receive contingent payments, based on Endo\u2019s achievement of pre-determined sales and gross margin milestones, in an amount up to $20.0 million. Our ability to receive these contingent payments under our supply agreement with Endo is dependent upon Endo successfully maintaining and increasing market demand for, and sales of, Sumavel DosePro.\nIn addition, we have agreed to indemnify Endo and its affiliates against losses suffered as a result of our material breach of representations and warranties and our other obligations in the asset purchase agreement, and $8.5 million of the upfront cash payment has been deposited into escrow to fund such potential indemnification claims for a period of 12 months following the closing of the sale, which period will end in May 2015. We cannot provide any assurance that we will receive all or any portion of the $8.5 million escrow amount or any of the contingent milestone payments.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or develop our product candidates or commercialize our products.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and key clinical development, regulatory, sales and marketing and other personnel. As of December 31, 2014, we employed 201 full-time employees. Of the full-time employees, 149 were engaged in sales and marketing, nine were engaged in manufacturing operations, 22 were engaged in product development, quality assurance and clinical and regulatory activities and 21 were engaged in general and administrative activities (including business and corporate development). If we are not able to retain our expanded employee base, we may not be able to effectively manage our business or be successful in commercializing our products.\nWe are highly dependent on the development, regulatory, commercial and financial expertise of our senior management team. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the areas in Southern and Northern California, where we currently operate. Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. If we are not able to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development and commercialization objectives, our ability to raise additional capital, our ability to implement our business strategy and our ability to maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The loss of the services of any members of our senior management team, especially our Chief Executive Officer, Roger L. Hawley, and President, Stephen J. Farr, Ph.D., could negatively impact the commercialization of Zohydro ER and could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates, including ZX007, ZX008 and Relday. Further, if we lose any members of our senior management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements, and our business may be harmed as a result. In addition to the competition for personnel, our locations in California in particular are characterized by a high cost of living. As such, we could have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts.\nAlthough we have employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements are terminable by them at will at any time with or without notice and, therefore, do not provide any assurance that we will be able to retain their services. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of our senior management team or the lives of any of our other employees. In addition, we have clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development of products that may compete with ours. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected.\nThe implementation of a REMS for Zohydro ER has resulted in additional regulatory requirements, including the requirement for a Medication Guide and educational requirements for prescribers and patients, which could significantly impact our ability to commercialize Zohydro ER and dramatically reduce its market potential.\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act added Section 505-1 to the FFDCA. Section 505-1 permits FDA to require a REMS for a drug product to ensure the safe use of the drug. A REMS is a strategic safety program that the FDA requires to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug's risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry or undergo certain health evaluations or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy minimally at 18 months, three years and seven years after the strategy's approval.\nIn February 2009, the FDA informed opioid analgesic drug manufacturers that it would require a class-wide REMS for all long-acting and sustained-release opioid drug products, and as an extended-release formulation of hydrocodone, Zohydro ER became subject to the ER/LA opioid REMS upon approval. Pursuant to the FFDCA, the manufacturers subject to this class-wide REMS must work together to implement the REMS as part of a single shared system to reduce the burden of the REMS on the healthcare system. The central component of the ER/LA opioid REMS program is an education program for prescribers and patients. Specifically, the REMS for these products includes a Medication Guide available for distribution to patients who are dispensed the drug, as well as a number of elements to assure safe use. These elements include training for healthcare professionals who prescribe the drug; information provided to prescribers that they can use to educate patients in the safe use, storage, and disposal of opioids; and information provided to prescribers of the existence of the REMS and the need to successfully complete the necessary training. The prescriber training required as part of the REMS is conducted by accredited, independent continuing education providers, without cost to the healthcare professionals, under unrestricted grants funded by the opioid analgesic manufacturers. Moreover, REMS assessments must be submitted to the FDA on an annual basis to assess the extent to which the elements to assure safe use are meeting the goals of the REMS and whether the goals or elements should be modified.\nIn addition to the REMS, on September 10, 2013 the FDA announced post-marketing requirements for all ER/LA opioid analgesic NDA holders, which we are required to comply with. We are currently participating with eight other NDA holders to address these post-marketing requirements. These requirements and the REMS could significantly impact our ability to commercialize Zohydro ER and dramatically reduce its market potential.\nOur inability to successfully acquire, develop and market additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to grow our business.\nWe intend to in-license, acquire, develop and/or market additional products and product candidates in the area of CNS disorders. Because our internal research and development capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify and select promising pharmaceutical product candidates and products, negotiate licensing or acquisition agreements with their current owners and finance these arrangements.\nThe process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales and other resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts.\nFurther, any product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including pre-clinical or clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that any products that we develop or approved products that we acquire will be manufactured or sold profitably or achieve market acceptance.\nAdditionally, as part of our growth strategy, we intend to seek to expand our product pipeline by exploring acquisition or in-licensing opportunities of proven drugs that can be paired with our DosePro needle-free drug delivery system. If we are not able to identify additional drug compounds that can be delivered via the current version of our DosePro technology, or if we are unable to successfully develop higher dose versions of this technology, our ability to develop additional product candidates and grow our business would be adversely affected. We and Battelle, our technology co-marketing partner, are also seeking opportunities to out-license the DosePro technology to partners seeking to enhance, differentiate, or extend the life-cycle of their injectable products. However, there can be no assurance that our or Battelle's efforts to secure such a partnership will be successful. If we are unable to secure partnerships with companies that have compounds that can be delivered via the current version of our DosePro technology, or if we are unable to successfully develop higher dose versions of this technology, we will not be able to generate revenues from out-licensing our DosePro technology.\nIf we are unable to license or acquire additional product candidates or approved products and successfully develop and commercialize them, or if we are otherwise unable to pair our DosePro delivery system with other drugs or out-license the DosePro technology to others, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and prospects.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future partners, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. For example, we have in the past experienced failures in our information systems and computer servers, which may have been the result of a cyber-attack. These failures resulted in an interruption of our normal business operations and required substantial expenditure of financial and administrative resources to remedy. We cannot be sure that similar failures will not occur in the future. System failures, accidents or security breaches can cause interruptions in our operations, and can result in a material disruption of our commercialization activities, drug development programs and our business operations. The loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval and post-market study compliance efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Similarly, we rely on a large number of third parties to supply components for and manufacture our products and product candidates, warehouse and distribute Zohydro ER, and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the commercialization of Zohydro ER and development of ZX008, Relday or any of our other product candidates could be delayed.\nFluctuations in the value of the Euro or U.K. pound sterling could negatively impact our results of operations and increase our costs.\nPayments to our material suppliers and contract manufacturers are denominated in the Euro and U.K. pound sterling. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and to date all of the revenues we have generated have been in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2014, $ 20.4 million (based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2014) of our materials, contract manufacturing costs and other manufacturing-related costs were denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk, and our results of operations may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro or U.K. pound sterling. A significant appreciation in the Euro or U.K. pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar will result in higher expenses and cause increases in our net losses. Likewise, to the extent that we generate any revenues denominated in foreign currencies, or become required to make payments in other foreign currencies, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and those foreign currencies could also negatively impact our results of operations. We currently have not entered into any foreign currency hedging contracts to reduce the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and foreign currency hedging is inherently risky and may result in unanticipated losses.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for Zohydro ER or any of our other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval on reasonable pricing terms, their commercial success may be severely hindered.\nSuccessful sales of our products depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.\nIn addition, the market for our products will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. For example, in August 2014, Express Scripts added Zohydro ER to its list of excluded drugs for their National Preferred Drug formulary for 2015. Express Scripts is the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, and the inclusion of Zohydro ER on its list of excluded drugs for their National Preferred Drug formulary may have a negative impact on prescriptions and sales of Zohydro ER.\nIn addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using competitive bidding\nprocedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This can reduce demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for Zohydro ER or any of our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\nThe commercial use of our products and clinical use of our products and product candidates expose us to the risk of product liability claims. This risk exists even if a product is approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities regulated by the FDA, such as the case with Zohydro ER, or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our products and product candidates are designed to affect important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with Zohydro ER or our product candidates could result in injury to a patient or even death. For example, Zohydro ER is an opioid pain reliever that contains hydrocodone, which is a regulated \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and could result in harm to patients relating to its potential for abuse. In addition, a liability claim may be brought against us even if our products or product candidates merely appear to have caused an injury.\nProduct liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products or product candidates, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims we will incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products or, if approved, product candidates;\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022\nproduct recall or withdrawal from the market;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; or\n\u2022\nloss of revenues.\nWe have obtained product liability insurance coverage for commercial product sales and clinical trials with a $20 million per occurrence and annual aggregate coverage limit. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our product liability related expenses or losses and may not cover us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, in sufficient amounts or upon adequate terms to protect us against losses due to product liability. If we determine that it is prudent to increase our product liability coverage based on sales of Zohydro ER, approval of ZX007, ZX008, or Relday, or otherwise, we may be unable to obtain this increased product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Large judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects, including side effects that are less severe than those of Zohydro ER and our product candidates. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock\nprice to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may never receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States.\nWe intend to market certain of our product candidates outside of the United States. For example, ZX008 has recently received orphan drug designation in Europe, and we expect to initiate two Phase 3 studies during the third quarter of 2015, one in the United States and one in Europe. In order to market our products outside of the United States, we, or any potential partner, must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our products. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d regarding FDA approval in the United States, as well as other risks. For example, in the European Economic Area (comprised of 27 European Union, or EU, member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), we can take advantage of the hybrid application pathway of the EU Centralized Procedure, which is similar to the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) pathway. Hybrid applications may rely in part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials contained in the authorization dossier of the reference product, but must be supplemented with additional data. In territories where data is not freely available, we or our partners may not have the ability to commercialize our products without negotiating rights from third parties to refer to their clinical data in our regulatory applications, which could require the expenditure of significant additional funds. We, or any potential partner, may be unable to obtain rights to the necessary clinical data and may be required to develop our own proprietary safety effectiveness dossiers. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others.\nInability to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects detailed in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d regarding FDA approval in the United States. As described above, such effects include the risks that our product candidates may not be approved at all or for all requested indications, which could limit the uses of our product candidates and have an adverse effect on their commercial potential or require costly, post-marketing studies. In addition, we, or any potential partner, may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution if we are unable to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturers' and suppliers' activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including the components of our product and product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers' facilities pending use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, injury to our employees and others, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nIn connection with the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations, we are required to make estimates and judgments which involve uncertainties, and any significant differences between our estimates and actual results could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In particular, as part of our revenue recognition policy, our estimates of product returns, rebates and chargebacks require our most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are\ninherently uncertain. Any significant differences between our actual results and our estimates and assumptions could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in accounting standards and their interpretations could adversely affect our operating results.\nGAAP are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC, and various other bodies that promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. These principles and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective judgments. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have never generated net income from operations or positive cash flow from operations and are dependent upon external sources of financing to fund our business and development.\nWe launched our first approved product, Sumavel DosePro, in January 2010 and subsequently sold the business in April 2014. We launched our approved product, Zohydro ER, in March 2014. Given our limited sales history for Zohydro ER, we may not accurately predict future sales, and we may never be able to significantly increase sales. We have financed our operations primarily through the proceeds from the issuance of our common and preferred stock, including the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in November 2010, our follow-on public offerings completed in September 2011, July 2012 and November 2013, our controlled equity offering program, which was terminated in November 2013, and debt, and have incurred losses and negative cash flow from operations in each year since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred net income (loss) of $8.6 million, $(80.9) million and $(47.4) million, respectively, and our cash used in operating activities was $(80.8) million, $(44.9) million and $(52.2) million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $(401.7) million. These losses and negative cash flow from operations have had a material adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital.\nWe expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flow from operating activities for at least the next year primarily as a result of the expenses incurred in connection with the commercialization of Zohydro ER, including introduction of Zohydro ER with BeadTek to the market, the clinical development of ZX008 and Relday, required post-market testing for Zohydro ER, safe use initiatives for Zohydro ER and additional development activities with respect to Zohydro ER, including the development of ZX007, an additional formulation with abuse deterrent properties. As a result, we may remain dependent upon external sources of financing to fund our business and the development and commercialization of our approved products and product candidates. To the extent we need to raise additional capital in the future, we cannot ensure that debt or equity financing will be available to us in amounts, at times or on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. Any shortfall in our cash resources could require that we delay or abandon certain development and commercialization activities and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may not be able to sell shares of our common stock under our controlled equity offering program with Cantor at times, prices or quantities that we desire, and if such sales do occur, they may result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOn November 6, 2014, we entered into the sales agreement with Cantor. Sales of our common stock made pursuant to the controlled equity offering program, if any, will be made on the Nasdaq Global Market under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on November 6, 2014, which was declared effective on January 20, 2015. Under the terms of the sales agreement, Cantor will use its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations and the rules of the Nasdaq Global Market, to sell shares of our common stock designated by us. However, there can be no assurance that Cantor will be successful in consummating such sales based on prevailing market conditions or in the quantities or at the prices that we deem appropriate. In addition, we will not be able to make sales of our common stock pursuant to the sales agreement unless certain conditions are met, which include accuracy of representations and warranties made to Cantor under the sales agreement; compliance with laws; and the continued listing of our stock on the Nasdaq Global Market. In addition, Cantor is permitted to terminate the sales agreement at any time. If we are unable to access funds through sales under the sales agreement, or it is terminated by Cantor, we may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all.\nTo the extent that we sell shares pursuant to the sales agreement, it will dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders, and may result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock. If we sell shares under the sales agreement at a time when our share price is decreasing, we will need to issue more shares to raise the same amount than if our stock price was\nhigher. Issuances in the face of a declining share price will have an even greater dilutive effect than if our share price were stable or increasing, and may further decrease our share price.\nOur results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn.\nOur results of operations and liquidity could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Domestic and international equity and debt markets have experienced and may continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil based on domestic and international economic conditions and concerns. In the event these economic conditions and concerns continue or worsen and the markets continue to remain volatile, our results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways, including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary, and our stock price may decline. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are not federally insured. If economic instability continues, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these investments.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, including through our controlled equity offering program with Cantor, debt financings, receivables or royalty financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, your ownership interest in us will be diluted. Debt financing typically contains covenants that restrict operating activities.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our current product or product candidates or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available, our ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited and we may be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate the commercialization and development of our product or product candidates.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss and research and development income tax credit carryforwards may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss and research and development income tax credit carryforwards (collectively, tax attributes) that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income, if any. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a three-year period as determined under the IRC, which we refer to as an ownership change. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of these tax attributes before they expire. Prior to our initial public offering in November 2010, we performed an IRC Section 382 and 383 analysis and determined that we had one ownership change, which occurred in August 2006 upon the issuance of convertible preferred stock. We performed an additional IRC Section 382 and 383 analysis upon the issuance of common stock in our follow-on public offering in September 2011, and together with the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering and certain other transactions involving our common stock, resulted in an additional ownership change. We had a third ownership change as defined by IRC Sections 382 and 383, which occurred in January 2014. There was no forfeiture in federal and California net operating loss carryforwards or research and development income tax credits as a result of the third ownership change. As a result of these ownership changes, our ability to use our then existing tax attributes to offset future taxable income, if any, was limited. Any future equity financing transactions, private placements and other transactions that occur within the specified three-year period may trigger additional ownership changes, which could further limit our use of such tax attributes. Any such limitations, whether as the result of prior or future offerings of our common stock or sales of common stock by our existing stockholders, could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in future years.\nThe terms of our credit facility place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.\nEffective as of December 30, 2014, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or the credit facility, with Oxford as collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time, or the lenders, including Oxford and SVB, that is secured by substantially all of our personal property other than our intellectual property. The outstanding principal balance under the credit facility was $21.5 million at the closing of the loan and security agreement on December 30, 2014.\nThe credit facility includes affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and any subsidiaries we create in the future. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, maintain insurance coverage and satisfy certain requirements\nregarding accounts receivable. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on our transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets and suffering a change in control, in each case subject to certain exceptions.\nThe credit facility also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which could cause interest to be charged at the rate that is otherwise applicable plus 5.0% and would provide Oxford, as collateral agent, with the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the credit facility, including foreclosure against our properties securing the credit facilities, including our cash. These events of default include, among other things, our failure to pay any amounts due under the credit facility, a breach of covenants under the credit facility, our insolvency, a material adverse change, the occurrence of any default under certain other indebtedness in an amount greater than $400,000, one or more judgments against us in an amount greater than $400,000 individually or in the aggregate and any action by the FDA that limits or prohibits our ability to sell or market Zohydro ER.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and ability to raise additional sources of cash, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring our debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. If we desire to refinance our indebtedness, our ability to do so will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nRisks Related to Regulation of our Product and Product Candidates\nAnnual DEA quotas on the amount of hydrocodone allowed to be produced in the United States and our specific allocation of hydrocodone by the DEA could significantly limit the production or sale of Zohydro ER.\nThe DEA limits the production and availability of all Schedule II substances through a quota system which includes a national aggregate production quota and individual procurement quotas. Because hydrocodone is subject to the DEA's production and procurement quota scheme, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate production quota for how much hydrocodone may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA's estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount of hydrocodone that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. The DEA may adjust individual procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. The DEA requires substantial evidence and documentation of expected legitimate medical and scientific needs before assigning procurement quotas to manufacturers and research organizations. Daravita which has licensed us the right to sell Zohydro ER in the United States, has been granted sufficient procurement quota of hydrocodone by the DEA to support our current demand of Zohydro ER and expected growth through the end of 2015.\nWe do not know what amounts of hydrocodone other companies manufacturing or developing product candidates containing hydrocodone may request for future years. The DEA, in assessing factors such as medical need, abuse and diversion potential and other policy considerations, may choose to set the aggregate hydrocodone production quota lower than the total amount requested for procurement by the companies. Daravita is permitted to petition the DEA to increase the annual procurement quota after it is initially established, but there is no guarantee that the DEA would act favorably upon such a petition. Daravita's procurement quota of hydrocodone may not be sufficient to meet any future clinical development needs or commercial demand for Zohydro ER. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing the procurement quota or a reduction in Daravita\u2019s procurement quota for hydrocodone or the DEA's failure to increase it over time as we anticipate could delay or stop commercial sale of Zohydro ER or cause us not to achieve our expected operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may not be able to maintain orphan drug designation or obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for ZX008.\nWe have obtained orphan drug designation for ZX008 in the United States and Europe. In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation in the United States confers certain benefits, including tax incentives and waiver of the applicable application fee upon submission of the product for approval in the rare disease or condition.\nIf a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is generally entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or EMA from approving another marketing application for the same drug to treat the same rare disease or condition for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nThe orphan drug exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition in the United States because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA and EMA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nOur currently approved product Zohydro ER is, and any of our other product candidates that receive regulatory approval will be, subject to ongoing and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize such products.\nEven after we achieve U.S. regulatory approval for a product, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or on the conditions of approval. For example, a product's approval may contain requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies and surveillance, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product, or the implementation of a REMS program. The Zohydro ER approval requires us to conduct post-marketing studies and implement the ER/LA opioid class-wide REMS with respect to our product. We are also subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review with respect to the manufacturing, processing, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our product. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment registration and drug listing, as well as continued compliance with cGMP for our marketed and investigational products, and with GCP and GLP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our products in clinical and pre-clinical development, and for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. To the extent that a product is approved for sale in other countries, we may be subject to similar restrictions and requirements imposed by laws and government regulators in those countries.\nIn the case of Zohydro ER and any product candidates containing controlled substances, we and our contract manufacturers will also be subject to ongoing DEA regulatory obligations, including, among other things, annual registration renewal, security, recordkeeping, theft and loss reporting, periodic inspection and annual quota allotments for the raw material for commercial production of our products. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations, QSR requirements for medical device components or similar requirements, if applicable. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where, or processes by which, the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturer or us, including requiring product recall, notice to physicians, withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we, our products or product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our products or product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022 impose restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, suspend or withdraw product approvals or revoke necessary licenses;\n\u2022 issue warning letters, show cause notices or untitled letters describing alleged violations, which may be publicly available;\n\u2022 commence criminal investigations and prosecutions;\n\u2022 impose injunctions, suspensions or revocations of necessary approvals or other licenses;\n\u2022 impose fines or other civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022 suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022 deny or reduce quota allotments for the raw material for commercial production of our controlled substance\nproducts;\n\u2022 delay or refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u2022 refuse to permit drugs or precursor chemicals to be imported or exported to or from the United States;\n\u2022 suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022 seize or detain products or require us to initiate a product recall.\nIn addition, our product labeling, advertising and promotion are subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug products. In particular, a drug may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product's approved labeling, although the FDA does not regulate the prescribing practices of physicians. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe FDA's regulations, policies or guidance may change and new or additional statutes or government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. For example, the FDASIA requires the FDA to issue new guidance describing its policy regarding internet and social media promotion of regulated medical products, and the FDA has since released several draft guidance documents enumerating new regulatory obligations and restrictions with respect to this type of promotion. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from pending or future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our drugs, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability.\nZohydro ER, ZX007, ZX008, Relday and our other product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other unexpected properties that could result in post-approval regulatory action.\nIf we or others identify undesirable side effects, or other previously unknown problems, caused by our products, other products or our product candidates with the same or related active ingredients, after obtaining U.S. regulatory approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require us to recall the product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may add new limitations for distribution and marketing of the product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of warnings in the product label or narrowing of the indication in the product label;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or modify the product in some other way;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to have a REMS program;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nThe incidence of adverse events was 33.7% and 28.8% in the open label titration and double blind treatment periods of our Phase 3 efficacy trial for Zohydro ER, respectively. Overall, the most commonly reported adverse events (>2%) in this trial were constipation, nausea, somnolence, vomiting, diarrhea, insomnia, fatigue, headache, dizziness and dry mouth. These are typical adverse events associated with chronic opioid therapy.\nAny of the above events resulting from undesirable side effects or other previously unknown problems could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.\nOur development strategy for Relday depends upon the FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety and effectiveness of risperidone based on data not developed by us, but which the FDA may rely upon in reviewing any future NDA.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Amendments added Section 505(b)(2) to the FFDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Under this statutory provision, the FDA may rely, for purposes of approving an NDA, on safety and effectiveness data not developed by the filer of the NDA. Similar to Zohydro ER, we plan to submit an NDA for Relday under Section 505(b)(2), and as such, the NDA will rely, in part, on the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness for risperidone. Even though we may be able to take advantage of Section 505(b)(2) to support potential U.S. approval for Relday, the FDA may require us, and did require us with respect to Zohydro ER, to perform additional studies or measurements to support approval. In addition, the FDA's interpretation and use of Section 505(b)(2) has been controversial and has previously been challenged in court, but without a definitive ruling on the propriety of the FDA's approach. Future challenges, including a direct challenge to the approval of our products and product candidates, may be possible and, if successful, could limit or eliminate our ability to rely on the Section 505(b)(2) pathway for the approval of Relday and our other product candidates. Such a result could require us to conduct additional testing and costly clinical trials, which could substantially delay or prevent the approval and launch of Relday and our other product candidates, such as ZX008.\nZohydro ER is a controlled substance subject to DEA regulations and failure to comply with these regulations, or the cost of compliance with these regulations, may adversely affect our business.\nZohydro ER contains hydrocodone, a regulated \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, production quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Zohydro ER, because it is a hydrocodone product, is regulated by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA. All Schedule II substance prescriptions, such as prescriptions for Zohydro ER, must be in writing and signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription.\nThe manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use, among other things, of controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation, including security, record-keeping and reporting obligations enforced by the DEA. Our failure to comply with these requirements could result in the loss of our ability to supply Zohydro ER, significant restrictions on Zohydro ER, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.\nThe DEA, and some states, also conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Facilities that conduct research, manufacture, store, distribute, import or export controlled substances must be registered to perform these activities and have the security, control and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. Failure to maintain compliance, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings.\nIndividual states also have controlled substances laws. Though state controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs, as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the DEA does so, in other states there has to be rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any controlled substance drug product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could have a material adverse effect on the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our partners must also obtain separate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions from the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\nThe FDA, in conjunction with the DEA, required us to implement a comprehensive REMS containing the elements of the class-wide ER/LA opioid REMS to reduce the inappropriate use of Zohydro ER, including restrictions on the manner in which it is marketed and sold, so as to reduce the risk of improper patient selection and diversion or abuse of the product. The restrictions of this program could limit market acceptance of the product.\nPursuant to the terms of our license agreement with Daravita, we entered into a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement for Zohydro ER with Daravita. Daravita has the exclusive right to manufacture and supply both clinical and commercial supplies of Zohydro ER (subject to certain exceptions). While Daravita is required to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding controlled substances, we do not have any direct control over Daravita's compliance in these regards, and any failure by Daravita to comply with those laws and regulations could result in a reduction or cessation of production of Zohydro ER.\nHealthcare reform measures and changes in policies, funding, staffing and leadership at the FDA and other agencies could hinder or prevent the commercial success of Zohydro ER and any of our product candidates that may be approved by the FDA.\nIn the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could affect our future results of operations and the future results of operations of our customers. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 established a new Part D prescription drug benefit, which became effective January 1, 2006. Under the prescription drug benefit, Medicare beneficiaries can obtain prescription drug coverage from private sector plans that are permitted to limit the number of prescription drugs that are covered in each therapeutic category and class on their formularies. If Zohydro ER or any of our product candidates that are approved by the FDA are not widely included on the formularies of these plans, our ability to market our products to the Medicare population could suffer.\nFurthermore, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA, was signed into law, which includes measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:\n\u2022 an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u2022 an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u2022 a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u2022 a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022 extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in April 2010 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level beginning in 2014, thereby potentially increasing both the volume of sales and manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u2022 expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022 new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and others, including reporting any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers and reporting any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during each calendar year. Manufacturers were required to begin data collection on August 1, 2013 and report such data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year;\n\u2022 a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians, effective April 1, 2012;\n\u2022 a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;\n\u2022 a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u2022 creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if Congress does not act on the recommendations; and\n\u2022 establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.\nOther legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.\nGiven recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription drugs and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While we cannot predict the full outcome of any such legislation, it may result in decreased reimbursement for prescription drugs, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce prescription drug prices. This could harm our ability to market our products and generate revenues. In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would permit more widespread importation or re-importation of pharmaceutical products from foreign countries into the United States, including from countries where the products are sold at lower prices than in the United States. Such legislation, or similar regulatory changes, could lead to a decision to decrease our prices to better compete, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Alternatively, in response to legislation such as this, we might elect not to seek approval for or market our products in foreign jurisdictions in order to minimize the risk of re-importation, which could also reduce the revenue we generate from our product sales. It is also possible that other legislative proposals having similar effects will be adopted.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities' assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. We cannot be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to our business prospects. For example, average review times at the FDA for marketing approval applications have fluctuated over the last ten years, and we cannot predict the review time for any of our submissions with any regulatory authorities. In addition, review times can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes.\nWe may incur liability if our continuing medical or health education programs and/or product promotions are determined, or are perceived, to be inconsistent with regulatory guidelines.\nThe FDA provides guidelines with respect to appropriate promotion and continuing medical and health education activities. Although we endeavor to follow these guidelines, the FDA or the Office of the Inspector General: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services may disagree, and we may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, management\u2019s attention could be diverted and our reputation could be damaged.\nIf we do not comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nAs a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient\nprivacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which constrains our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us which provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us which provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nfederal \u201csunshine\u201d requirements that require drug manufacturers to report and disclose any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, and any investment or ownership interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report data to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians, including the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws and impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may be found out of compliance of one or more of the requirements.\nTo the extent that any product we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nImport/export regulations and tariffs may change and increase our costs.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the regulations relating to the import and export of products and materials. We cannot predict whether the import and/or export of our products will be adversely affected by changes in, or enactment of, new quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions imposed by any country in the future. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. It is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights and technology, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur commercial success depends in large part on obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection of our product, Zohydro ER, our current product candidates, including ZX008 and Relday, and any future product candidates, their respective components, formulations, methods used to manufacture them and methods of treatment, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing Zohydro ER or our product candidates is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.\nWe in-license certain intellectual property for Zohydro ER from Daravita, and certain intellectual property for Relday from Durect. We rely on these licensors to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain patents and otherwise protect certain of the intellectual property we license from them. We have not had and do not have primary control over these activities or any other intellectual property that may be related to our in-licensed intellectual property. For example, with respect to our license agreements with Daravita and Durect, we cannot be certain that such activities by Daravita and Durect have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights. Daravita has retained the first right, but not the obligation, to initiate an infringement proceeding against a third-party infringer of the intellectual property rights that Daravita has licensed to us, and enforcement of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the non-infringement, invalidity or unenforceability of these patents would also be subject to the control or cooperation of Daravita. Similarly, Durect has retained the first right, but not the obligation, to initiate an infringement proceeding against a third-party infringer of certain of the intellectual property rights that Durect has licensed to us, and enforcement of certain of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the non-infringement, invalidity or unenforceability of these patents would also be subject to the control or cooperation of Durect. We are not entitled to control the manner in which Daravita or Durect may defend certain of the intellectual property that is licensed to us and it is possible that their defense activities may be less vigorous than had we conducted the defense ourselves. We also in-license certain data from a continuing, long-term, open-label study in 15 Dravet syndrome patients, as well as certain intellectual property related to fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome from the Universities of Antwerp and Leuven in Belgium, or the Universities.\nOn August 13 and September 20, 2014, we received separate notices of paragraph IV certifications from Actavis and from Alvogen, respectively, advising us of the filing of ANDAs with the FDA for a generic version of Zohydro ER. These certification notices allege that the two U.S. patents listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book for Zohydro ER, with an expiration date in November 2019, will not be infringed by Actavis' or Alvogen\u2019s proposed products, are invalid and/or are unenforceable. On September 3, 2014, Daravita filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Actavis, and on November 3, 2014, Daravita filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Alvogen. Daravita has licensed rights to Zohydro ER to us, and, under the Zohydro ER license agreement, Daravita has the right to control the enforcement of patents and related proceedings involving Zohydro ER and any prospective generic entrant. We intend to vigorously enforce the intellectual property rights relating to Zohydro ER, but we cannot predict the outcome of these matters or guarantee the outcome of any litigation. An adverse outcome in this litigation could result in one or more generic versions of Zohydro ER being launched in the United States before the expiration of the applicable patents. Since Zohydro ER is currently our only approved product, the introduction of a generic version of Zohydro ER could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nMost of our patents related to DosePro were acquired from Aradigm, who acquired those patents from a predecessor owner. Our patents related to Zohydro ER are licensed from Daravita, who acquired those patents from a predecessor owner. Thus, most of our patents, as well as many of our pending patent applications, were not written by us or our attorneys, or our licensor or licensors' attorneys, and neither we nor our licensors had control over the drafting and prosecution of these patents. Further, the former patent owners and our licensors might not have given the same attention to the drafting and prosecution of\nthese patents and applications as we would have if we had been the owners of the patents and applications and had control over the drafting and prosecution. In addition, the former patent owners may not have been completely familiar with U.S. patent law, possibly resulting in inadequate disclosure and/or claims. This could possibly result in findings of invalidity or unenforceability of the patents we own and in-license, patents issuing with reduced claim scope, or in pending applications not issuing as patents.\nIn addition, as part of the agreement wherein we acquired patents related to DosePro from Aradigm, Aradigm retained, and we granted to Aradigm, a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license to the acquired patents solely for purposes of the delivery of one or more aerosolized active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, directly into the bronchia or lungs. The agreement with Aradigm also includes a covenant not to compete with us regarding technologies or products for the delivery of one or more APIs via needle free injection. That covenant expired on August 26, 2010, giving Aradigm or its licensees the right to develop and sell other needle-free injection technologies and products.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and medical device companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents in these fields has emerged to date in the United States. There have been recent changes regarding how patent laws are interpreted, and both the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, and Congress have recently made significant changes to the patent system. There have been three U.S. Supreme Court decisions that now show a trend of the Supreme Court which is distinctly negative on patents. The trend of these decisions along with resulting changes in patentability requirements being implemented by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could make it increasingly difficult for us to obtain and maintain patents on our products. We cannot accurately predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws which might be enacted into law. Those changes may materially affect our patents, our ability to obtain patents and/or the patents and applications of our collaborators and licensors. The patent situation in these fields outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents we own or to which we have a license or third-party patents.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make or use compounds that are the same or similar to the pharmaceutical compounds used in Zohydro ER and our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents or our in-licensed patents;\n\u2022\nthe APIs in Zohydro ER, ZX008 and Relday are, or will soon become, commercially available in generic drug products, and no patent protection will be available without regard to formulation or method of use;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors, as the case may be, may not be able to detect infringement against our in-licensed patents, which may be especially difficult for manufacturing processes or formulation patents;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors, as the case may be, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our owned or in-licensed issued patents or pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors, as the case may be, might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our owned or in-licensed U.S. patents or patent applications are not Orange-Book eligible;\n\u2022\nit is possible that there are dominating patents to Zohydro ER, ZX008 or Relday of which we are not aware;\n\u2022\nit is possible that there are prior public disclosures that could invalidate our or our licensors' inventions, as the case may be, or parts of our or their inventions of which we or they are not aware;\n\u2022\nit is possible that others may circumvent our owned or in-licensed patents;\n\u2022\nit is possible that there are unpublished applications or patent applications maintained in secrecy that may later issue with claims covering our products or technology similar to ours;\n\u2022\nit is possible that the U.S. government may exercise any of its statutory rights to our owned or in-licensed patents or applications that were developed with government funding;\n\u2022\nthe claims of our owned or in-licensed issued patents or patent applications, if and when issued, may not cover our system or products or our system or product candidates;\n\u2022\nour owned or in-licensed issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be narrowed in scope, be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal administrative challenges by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies for which we can obtain patent protection; or\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our licensors, collaborators and suppliers. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, state laws in the Unites States vary, and their courts as well as courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. If our confidential or proprietary information is divulged to or acquired by third parties, including our competitors, our competitive position in the marketplace will be harmed and our ability to successfully penetrate our target markets could be severely compromised.\nIf any of our owned or in-licensed patents are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are otherwise unable to adequately protect our rights, it could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to commercialize or license our technology and products. Likewise, our patents covering certain technology used in our DosePro system are expected to expire on various dates from 2015 through 2026 and the patents and patent applications licensed to us by Daravita are expected to expire in 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our patent portfolio included 23 issued U.S. patents, four pending U.S. patent applications, 43 issued foreign patents and seven pending foreign patent applications relating to various aspects of Sumavel DosePro and our DosePro technology. Thirteen of our U.S. patents relating to our DosePro technology, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,957,886, 6,135,979, 7,776,007, 7,901,385, 8,267,903, 8,118,771, 8,241,243, 8,241,244, 8,287,489, 8,343,130, 8,663,158 and 8,715,259 are expected to expire in 2016, 2017, 2026, 2026, 2023, 2023, 2025, 2022, 2024, 2022, 2022 and 2023, respectively. U.S. Patent No. 5,957,886 claims a needleless injector system using a viscous damping medium; U.S. Patent No. 6,135,979 covers the needleless injector with particular safety mechanisms; U.S. Patent Nos. 7,776,007 and 8,287,489 cover systems with a cap and latch mechanism; U.S. Patent Nos. 7,901,385, 8,267,903 and 8,715,259 encompass various embodiments of the casing for enclosing the injection systems; U.S. Patent Nos. 8,118,771, 8,241,243 and 8,241,244 cover a method of reducing breakage of glass capsules; 8,491,524 and 8,663,158 relates to a drug capsule filled with a formulation purged with an inert gas; and 8,343,130 covers a method of reducing the propensity to create a shock wave on firing the system as used in the Sumavel DosePro system. U.S. Patent Nos. 6,902,742 and 6,228,398 relating to Zohydro ER covers a modified release composition containing hydrocodone and are expected to expire in November 2019. Upon the expiration of these patents, we or Daravita, as applicable, will lose the right to exclude others from practicing the claimed inventions. Additionally, eleven of these thirteen patents are the only patents currently listed in the FDA Orange Book for Sumavel DosePro. Two patents are listed for Zohydro ER. The expiration of the Orange Book listed patents will mean that we lose certain advantages that come with Orange Book listing of patents. The expiration of these patents could also have a similar material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Moreover, if Daravita or Durect decides not to commence or continue any action relating to the defense of the patents they have licensed to us, they are required to notify us and we have the right to initiate proceedings after receiving their notice. Such proceedings will require the assistance of Daravita or Durect, as applicable, and we have limited control over the amount or timing of resources Daravita or Durect devotes on our behalf or the priority they place on enforcing these patent rights.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nOur existing licenses with Daravita, Durect and the Universities imposes various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to develop or market the affected products. If we lose such license rights, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially adversely affected. We may enter into additional licenses in the future and if we fail to comply with obligations under those agreements, we could suffer similar consequences.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights, and we may be unable to protect our rights to our products and technology.\nIf we or our collaborators or licensors choose to go to court to stop a third party from using the inventions claimed in our owned or in-licensed patents, that third party may ask the court to rule that the patents are not infringed, invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we or they, as the case may be, were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we or they, as the case may be, do not have the right to stop others from using the inventions.\nThere is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the third party on the ground that such third-party's activities do not infringe our owned or in-licensed patents. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently changed some tests regarding granting patents and assessing the validity of patents. As a consequence, issued patents may be found to contain invalid claims according to the newly revised standards. Some of our own or in-licensed patents may be subject to challenge and subsequent invalidation or significant narrowing of claim scope in a reexamination or other post-grant proceeding before the PTO, or during litigation, under the revised criteria which make it more difficult to obtain patents. We are not entitled to control the manner in which Daravita or Durect may defend certain of the intellectual property that is licensed to us, either in a reexamination or other post-grant proceeding before the PTO, or during the litigation, and it is possible that their defense activities may be less vigorous than had we conducted the defense ourselves.\nWe may also not be able to detect infringement of our own or in-licensed patents, which may be especially difficult for methods of manufacturing or formulation products. While we intend to take actions reasonably necessary to enforce our patent rights, we depend, in part, on our licensors and collaborators to protect a substantial portion of our proprietary rights. For example, Daravita, our licensor, is primarily responsible for the enforcement of the intellectual property rights related to Zohydro ER. Under the agreement, Daravita has the first right, but not the obligation, to initiate an infringement proceeding against a third-party infringer. If Daravita decides not to commence or continue any action, they are required to notify us and grant us step in rights to enforce the in-licensed intellectual property. Such enforcement will require the cooperation of Daravita, and we will be responsible for Daravita\u2019s reasonable expenses and attorney's fees incurred as a result of that cooperation. We have limited control over the amount or timing of resources Daravita devotes on our behalf or the priority they place on enforcing these patent rights to our advantage. Similarly, Durect, our licensor, is primarily responsible for the enforcement of certain of the intellectual property rights it licenses to us related to Relday. Under the agreement, Durect has the first right, but not the obligation, to initiate an infringement proceeding against a third-party infringer of those intellectual property rights through the use, marketing, sale or import of a product that is competitive to Relday. If Durect decides not to commence or continue any such action, we have the right, but not the duty, to do so and such enforcement will require the cooperation of Durect. We have limited control over the amount or timing of resources Durect devotes on our behalf or the priority it places on enforcing these patent rights to our advantage.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields relating to Zohydro ER, ZX008 and Relday. As the medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that others may assert that our products or product candidates infringe the patent rights of others. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of medical devices, drugs, products or their methods of use. Thus, because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our fields, there may be a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our products, product candidates, technology or methods.\nIn addition, there may be issued patents of third parties of which we are currently unaware, that are infringed or are alleged to be infringed by our products, product candidate or proprietary technologies. Because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, patent applications in the United States and many\nforeign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our owned and in-licensed issued patents or our pending applications, or that we or, if applicable, a licensor were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our products or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our owned and in-licensed patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to those owned or in-licensed to us, we or, in the case of in-licensed technology, the licensor may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such proceedings may be decided against us if the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own or, if applicable, our licensor's invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions. In addition, if another party has reason to assert a substantial new question of patentability against any of our claims in our owned and in-licensed U.S. patents, the third party can request that the PTO reexamine the patent claims, which may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent. In addition to potential infringement claims, interference and reexamination proceedings, we may become a party to patent opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, Australian Patent Office or other jurisdictions where either our patents are challenged, or we are challenging the patents of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts would be unsuccessful. We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our products and/or product candidates and/or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our commercialization partners are infringing the third party's patents and would order us or our partners to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our partners to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party's patents.\nIf a third-party's patent was found to cover our products and/or product candidates, proprietary technologies or their uses, we or our collaborators could be enjoined by a court and required to pay damages and could be unable to commercialize Zohydro ER or our product candidates or use our proprietary technologies unless we or they obtained a license to the patent. A license may not be available to us or our collaborators on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, during litigation, the patent holder could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our products, technologies or methods pending a trial on the merits, which could be years away.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or our collaborators infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 infringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022 substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product at issue infringes on or violates the third party\u2019s rights, and if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees;\n\u2022 a court order prohibiting us from selling or licensing the product unless the third party licenses its patent rights to us, which it is not required to do;\n\u2022 if a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees and/or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products; and\n\u2022 redesigning our products or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on our owned and in-licensed patents are due to be paid to the PTO in several stages over the lifetime of the patents. Future maintenance fees will also need to be paid on other patents which may be issued to us. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ outside firms to remind us or our in-licensor to pay annuity fees due to foreign patent agencies on our pending foreign patent applications. The PTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business. For the patents and patent applications related to Zohydro ER, Daravita is obligated to maintain our in-licensed patents in the United States under our license agreement. Should Daravita fail to pursue maintenance of our licensed patents and patent applications, Daravita is obligated to notify us and, at that time, we will be granted an opportunity to maintain the prosecution and avoid withdrawal, cancellation, expiration or abandonment of the licensed U.S. patents and applications. For the patents and patent applications related to Relday, Durect is obligated to maintain certain of our in-licensed patents on a worldwide basis, using commercially reasonable efforts, under our license agreement. Should Durect fail to pursue maintenance of certain of those licensed patents and patent applications, Durect is obligated to notify us and, at that time, we will be granted an opportunity to maintain the prosecution and avoid withdrawal, cancellation, expiration or abandonment of those licensed patents and applications.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and know-how, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our licensors, collaborators and suppliers. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. If our confidential or proprietary information is divulged to or acquired by third parties, including our competitors, our competitive position in the marketplace will be harmed and our ability to successfully generate revenues from Zohydro ER, and, if approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, our product candidates could be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other device, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management, which would adversely affect our financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Securities Markets and an Investment in Our Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and is likely to continue to fluctuate substantially.\nThe market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have historically been highly volatile, and the market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Since the commencement of trading in connection with our initial public offering in November 2010, the publicly traded shares of our common stock have themselves experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the price per share for our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market has ranged from a low sale price of $1.07 to a high sale price of $5.19. This market volatility is likely to continue. These and other factors could reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could change significantly, both over short periods of time and the longer term, due to many factors, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and the following:\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our commercial progress in promoting and selling Zohydro ER, including sales and revenue trends;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our additional labelling claims for the formulation of Zohydro ER with BeadTek;\n\u2022\nFDA or international regulatory actions and whether and when we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity, including political actions and, potentially, court decisions, related to Zohydro ER;\n\u2022\nannouncements of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors, including abuse deterrent formulations of hydrocodone products;\n\u2022\nthe development status of ZX007, ZX008, Relday or any of our other product candidates, including the results from our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning product development results or intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to litigation, intellectual property or our business, and the public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties;\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to ZX007, ZX008, Relday or any of our other product candidates or clinical development programs, including relating to the timing of invoices from, and other billing practices of, our CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical sector or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other pharmaceutical companies and price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022\nlitigation or public concern about the safety of Zohydro ER or our product candidates;\n\u2022\nactual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our inability to meet these projections;\n\u2022\ndeviations from securities analysts' estimates or the impact of other analyst comments;\n\u2022\nratings downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthird-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning current or future strategic collaborations, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022\ndevelopments affecting our contract manufacturers, component fabricators and service providers;\n\u2022\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, security breaches, system failures or responses to these events;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\ndiscussion of us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities.\nIn addition, the stock markets, and in particular the Nasdaq Global Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many pharmaceutical companies. Stock prices of many pharmaceutical companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may invest or spend our cash in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a significant return.\nOur management has considerable discretion in the use of our cash. Our cash may be used for purposes that do not increase our operating results or market value. Until the cash is used, it may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value. The failure of our management to invest or spend our cash effectively could result in unfavorable returns and uncertainty about our prospects, each of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period, particularly because the commercial success of, and demand for, Zohydro ER, as well as the success and costs of our ZX008, Relday and other product candidate development programs are uncertain and therefore our future prospects are uncertain. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\nfluctuations in the quarterly revenues of Zohydro ER, including fluctuations resulting from our distributors' inventory management practices and buying patterns;\n\u2022 the level of underlying demand for Zohydro ER or any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022 our ability to control production spending and underutilization of production capacity;\n\u2022 variations in the level of development and/or regulatory expenses related to ZX008, Relday or other development programs;\n\u2022 results of clinical trials for ZX008, Relday or any other of our product candidates;\n\u2022 any intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u2022 regulatory developments and legislative changes, including healthcare reform, affecting our products and product candidates or those of our competitors; and\n\u2022 our execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our business and could subject us to significant liabilities.\nThe stock markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of pharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations as well a broad range of other factors, including the realization of any of the risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally experience significant stock price volatility. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. Any adverse determination in any such litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require that we make significant payments.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. As of December 31, 2014, we had research coverage by only five securities analysts. If these securities analysts cease coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock may depress our stock price.\nPersons who were our stockholders prior to the sale of shares in our initial public offering in November 2010 continue to hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock that they are able to sell in the public market, subject in some cases to certain legal restrictions. Significant portions of these shares are held by a small number of stockholders. If these stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The perception in the market that these sales may occur could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. As of December 31, 2014, we had 153,361,743 shares of common stock outstanding. Of these shares, approximately 124,108,749 are freely tradeable, without restriction, in the public market.\nIn addition, shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and, in any event, we have filed a registration statement permitting shares of common stock issued on exercise of options to be freely sold in the public market. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nWe have registered under the Securities Act 15,784,200 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants we issued in July 2012, which warrants became exercisable on July 27, 2013 at an exercise price of $2.50 per share (subject to restrictions on exercise set forth in such warrants). As of December 31, 2014, warrants were still outstanding to exercise 15,215,450 shares of this registered common stock, which means that upon exercise of warrants, such shares will be freely tradeable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates. Further, certain holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act, which, if registered, would also become freely tradeable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates. In addition, our directors and executive officers may establish programmed selling plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, for the purpose of effecting sales of our common stock. Any sales of securities by these stockholders, warrantholders or executive officers and directors, or the perception that those sales may occur, could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which could limit the market price of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions include:\n\u2022 a board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time;\n\u2022 a prohibition on stockholder action through written consent, which requires that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022 a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or by a majority of the total number of authorized directors;\n\u2022 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022 a requirement that no member of our board of directors may be removed from office by our stockholders except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by law, upon the approval of not less than 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares of our voting stock then entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u2022 a requirement of approval of not less than 66 2/3% of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend any bylaws by stockholder action or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022 the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock on terms determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval and which preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors and could also delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing or cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock. We have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our available cash to fund the development and growth of our business. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation in the market price of their stock, which may never occur.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to meet compliance obligations.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, that impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, on July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. The requirements of these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place considerable strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Our management and other personnel have devoted and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives. In addition, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. In particular, commencing in fiscal 2011, we performed system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting which allowed management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. Our future testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. We expect to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with Section 404. Pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We currently do not have an internal audit function, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate consolidated financial statements or other reports on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources.", "PERMNO": 12413, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ZGNX"}
