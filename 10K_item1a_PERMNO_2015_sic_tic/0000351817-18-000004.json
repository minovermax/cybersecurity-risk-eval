{"cik": "351817", "company": "SILVERBOW RESOURCES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Business:\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile, and a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our financial results and impede our growth.\nOil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, during 2017 the WTI crude oil crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices ranged from approximately $42 to $60 per barrel and $2.44 to $3.71 per MMBtu, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the spot market price for WTI was $60.46 while the spot market price for natural gas was $2.95. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nprice and quantity of foreign imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil and natural gas price and production controls;\n\u2022\nlevel of consumer product demand, including as a result of competition from alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\nlevel of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nstockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nlevel of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America, Africa and Russia;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u2022\noverall U.S. and global economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nprice and availability of alternative fuels.\nOur financial condition, revenues, profitability and the carrying value of our properties depend upon the prevailing prices and demand for oil and natural gas. Any sustained periods of low prices for oil and natural gas are likely to materially and adversely affect our financial position, the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce, our cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to access funds through the capital markets, if they are available at all.\nInsufficient capital could lead to declines in our cash flow or in our oil and natural gas reserves, or a loss of properties.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. Our 2018 capital expenditure budget, including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions, drilling and infrastructure and fulfillment of abandonment obligations is expected to be in the range of $245 million and $265 million. We had approximately $219.5 million of capital expenditures in 2017. Cash flow from operations is a principal source of our financing of our future capital expenditures. Insufficient cash flow from operations and inability to access capital could lead to losing leases that require us to drill new wells in order to maintain the lease. Lower liquidity and other capital constraints may make it difficult to drill those wells prior to the lease expiration dates, which could result in our losing reserves and production.\nOur Credit Facilities, as defined below, contain operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur Credit Facilities include (i) that certain amended and restated senior secured revolving credit facility among the Company, as borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto (defined herein as the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) and (ii) that certain note purchase agreement among the Company, as issuer, U.S. Bank National Association, as agent and collateral agent and the holders party thereto (the \u201cSecond Lien\u201d, together with the Credit Facility, our \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). Our Credit Facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell assets, including equity interests in our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nredeem our debt;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur certain liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022\nredeem or prepay other debt;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into swap agreements beyond certain maximum thresholds;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain business activities.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nOur ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions contained in our Credit Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate or if oil and natural gas prices remain at their current level for an extended period of time or were to decline, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests in our Credit Facilities or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under our Credit Facilities or our future indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf an event of default under either of our Credit Facilities occurs and remains uncured, the lenders or holders under the applicable Credit Facility:\n\u2022\nwould not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022\ncould elect to declare all borrowings or notes outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nmay have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings or notes; or\n\u2022\nmay prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements.\nIn addition, our obligations under the Credit Facilities are collateralized by perfected first and second priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets, including mortgage liens on oil and natural gas properties having at least 85% of the PV-9 of the borrowing base properties (with respect to the Credit Facility) or the oil and gas properties constituting proved reserves as set forth in the most recent reserve report (with respect to the Second Lien), and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under the Credit Facilities, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets.\nMost of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nWe own leasehold interests in areas not currently held by production. Unless production in paying quantities is established or we exercise an extension option on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. We have leases on 22,126 net acres that could potentially expire during fiscal year 2018, representing approximately 25% of our net undeveloped acreage. Additionally, we have leases on 20,997 net acres in Colorado that are scheduled to expire in 2018. We have no plans to extend the leases for the Colorado acreage and plan to let them expire.\nOur drilling plans for areas not currently held by production are subject to change based upon various factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. On our acreage that we do not operate, we have less control over the timing of drilling; therefore, there is additional risk of expirations occurring in those sections.\nIf low commodity prices continue for an extended period, our liquidity would be significantly reduced.\nWe continue to have substantial capital needs following our emergence from bankruptcy, including in connection with our existing secured indebtedness and the continued development of our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital in the future to fund our operations, implement our business plan and fulfill our abandonment obligations. An extended period of low\ncommodity prices would substantially reduce our cash flows and would likely reduce liquidity to a level that would make it increasingly difficult to operate our business.\nWe have written down the carrying values on our oil and natural gas properties in 2015 and 2016 and could incur additional write-downs in the future.\nThe SEC accounting rules require that on a quarterly basis we review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible write-down or impairment (the \"ceiling test\"). Any capital costs in excess of the ceiling amount must be permanently written down. For the period of April 23, 2016 through December 31, 2016 (successor), period of January 1, 2016 through April 22, 2016 (predecessor), and the year ended December 31, 2015 (predecessor), we reported non-cash write-downs on a before-tax basis of, $133.5 million, $77.7 million and $1.6 billion ($1.5 billion after-tax) respectively, on our oil and natural gas properties. There was no write-down for the year ended December 31, 2017 (successor). If oil and natural gas prices decline in the future, we could be required to record additional non-cash write-downs of our oil and gas properties. Refer to Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the ceiling test calculation.\nEstimates of proved reserves are uncertain, and revenues from production may vary significantly from expectations.\nThe quantities and values of our proved reserves included in our 2017 estimates of proved reserves are only estimates and subject to numerous uncertainties. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. These estimates depend on assumptions regarding quantities and production rates of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves, future prices for oil and natural gas, timing and amounts of development expenditures and operating expenses, all of which will vary from those assumed in our estimates. If the variances in these assumptions are significant, many of which are based upon extrinsic events we cannot control, they could significantly affect these estimates and could result in the actual amounts of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates in our reserves reports. These estimates may not accurately predict the present value of future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect the Company\u2019s production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The Company uses hydraulic fracturing techniques in certain of its operations. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have conducted studies or asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in December 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. Additionally, in 2014, the EPA asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s (\u201cSDWA\u201d) Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities. The EPA also issued final federal Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) regulations in 2012 and in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and, in 2014, published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the federal Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. However, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule, the BLM appealed the decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2016, the appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM\u2019s issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM\u2019s rescission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court.\nThe U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, certain states, including Texas, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances\nwithin their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where the Company operates the Company could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to added delays for our operations or increased operating costs in our production of oil and natural gas. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nOur operations include the need of water for use in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. The Company\u2019s access to water may be limited due to reasons such as prolonged drought, private third party competition for water in localized areas, or the Company\u2019s inability to acquire or maintain water sourcing permits or other rights. In addition, some state and local governmental authorities have begun to monitor or restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to ensure adequate local water supply. Any such decrease in the availability of water could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition and operations. Moreover, any inability by the Company to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could adversely impact the Company\u2019s exploration and production operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nFederal or state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to induced seismicity could result in operating restrictions or delays that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s production of oil and natural gas.\nOperations associated with our production and development activities generate drilling muds, produced waters and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed of by means of injection into underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations. These disposal wells are regulated pursuant to the UIC program established under the SDWA and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from the EPA or an analogous state agency for construction and operation of such disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for disposal well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be disposed. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and produced water disposal may vary by region, and that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or may have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified Texas, where the Company conducts operations, as well as Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas as the states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity.\nIn response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma has issued rules for produced water disposal wells that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, is developing and implementing plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. The Texas Railroad Commission has adopted similar rules for the permitting of produced water disposal wells. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells in connection with Company activities to dispose of produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Any one or more of these developments may result in the Company having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require third party disposal well operators the Company may engage to dispose of produced water generated by Company activities to shut down disposal wells, which development could adversely affect the Company\u2019s production or result in the Company incurring increased costs and delays with respect to Company operations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas the Company produces.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.\nAt the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. However, the EPA has determined that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from large stationary sources that are already potential sources of significant, or criteria, pollutant emissions. The Company\u2019s operations could become subject to these permitting requirements and be required to install \"best available control technology\" to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that the Company may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs as well as criteria pollutants from such sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis from specified GHG emission sources in the United States, including onshore and offshore oil and gas production facilities, which may include certain Company operations. In October 2015, the EPA amended and expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting facilities and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines, and in January 2016, the EPA proposed additional revisions to leak detection methodology to align the reporting rules with the New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d).\nFederal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published NSPS, known as Subpart OOOOa, that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and VOC emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand previously issued NSPS published by the EPA in 2012 and known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices, requiring additional controls for pneumatic controllers and pumps as well as compressors and imposing leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster stations. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and re-evaluate the entirety of the 2016 standards but the EPA has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the June 2016 rule remains in effect but future implementation of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time. In another example, the BLM published a final rule in November 2016 that imposes requirements to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking on federal and Indian lands. However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule that temporarily suspends or delays certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019. The suspension of the November 2016 final rule is being challenged in court. These rules, should they remain in effect, and any other new methane emission standards imposed on the oil and natural gas sector could result in increased costs to our operations as well as result in delays or curtailment in such operations, which costs, delays or curtailment could adversely affect our business. Additionally, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that proposed an agreement requiring member countries to review and \"represent a progression\" in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 (the \"Paris Agreement\"). While this international agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.\nThe adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from the Company\u2019s equipment and operations could require the Company to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, including the imposition of a carbon tax, which one or more developments could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost to the consumer, and thereby reduce demand for oil and gas, which could reduce the demand for, or lower the value of, the oil and natural gas the Company produces. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or\nmidstream activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time.\nFinally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations. At this time, the Company has not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social, or physical impacts of climate change on the Company\u2019s operations.\nA worldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity, business and financial condition that we cannot control or predict.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect the financial viability of and increase the credit risk associated with our purchasers, suppliers, insurers, and commodity derivative counterparties to perform under the terms of contracts or financial arrangements we have with them. Although we have heightened our level of scrutiny of our contractual counterparties, our assessment of the risk of non-performance by various parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets. This same crisis may adversely impact insurers and their ability to pay current and future insurance claims that we may have.\nOur future access to capital could be limited due to tightening credit markets that could affect our ability to fund our future capital projects. In addition, long-term restriction upon or freezing of the capital markets and legislation related to financial and banking reform may affect short-term or long-term liquidity.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves high risks and we may suffer uninsured losses.\nThese risks include blowouts, explosions, adverse weather effects and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Although the Company currently maintains insurance coverage that it considers reasonable and that is similar to that maintained by comparable companies in the oil and natural gas industry, it is not fully insured against certain of these risks, such as business interruption, either because such insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs and deductibles associated with obtaining and carrying such insurance.\nDrilling wells is speculative and capital intensive.\nDeveloping and exploring properties for oil and natural gas requires significant capital expenditures and involves a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including title problems, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages, and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling or completion of an oil or natural gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. Exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nhurricanes, tropical storms or other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil and produced water spills, pipeline or tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions; and\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect our financial condition.\nPollution and property contamination arising from the Company\u2019s operations and the nearby operations of other oil and natural gas operators could expose the Company to significant costs and liabilities.\nThe performance of the Company\u2019s operations may result in significant environmental costs and liabilities as a result of handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater or other fluid discharges related to operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Spills or other unauthorized releases of regulated substances by or resulting from the Company\u2019s operations, or the nearby operations of other oil and natural gas operators, could expose the Company to material losses, expenditures and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations. Certain of these laws may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations the Company could be exposed to liability as a result of the Company\u2019s conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims against the Company for personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by the release of pollutants into the environment. Moreover, environmental laws and regulations generally have become more stringent in recent years and are expected to continue to do so, which could result in the occurrence of delays or cancellation in the permitting or performance of new or expanded projects, or more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements. Any one or more of such developments could require the Company to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry in general in addition to the Company\u2019s own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. The Company may not be able to recover some or any of its costs with respect to such developments from insurance.\nGovernment regulation of the Company\u2019s activities could adversely affect the Company and its operations.\nThe oil and natural gas business is subject to extensive governmental regulation under which, among other things, rates of production from oil and natural gas wells may be regulated. Governmental regulation also may affect the market for the Company\u2019s production and operations. Costs of compliance with governmental regulation are significant, and the cost of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect the results of the Company. We cannot predict the timing or impact of new or changed laws, regulations, or permit requirements or changes in the ways that such laws, regulations, or permit requirements are enforced, interpreted or administered. For example, various governmental agencies, including the EPA and analogous state agencies, the BLM, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can enact or change, begin to force compliance with, or otherwise modify their enforcement, interpretation or administration of, certain regulations that could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations that may expose the Company to significant costs and liabilities and could delay the pace or restrict the scope of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s oil and natural gas exploration, production and development operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and health, the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations, which may require the Company to take actions resulting in costly capital and operating expenditures at its wells and properties. These laws and regulations may restrict or affect the Company\u2019s business in many ways, including applying specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection, requiring the acquisition of a permit before drilling or other regulated activities commence, restricting the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment, limiting or prohibiting construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, and imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from the Company\u2019s operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigative, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays in the permitting or development or expansion of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of the Company\u2019s operations in a particular area.\nThe trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies may result in increased costs and liabilities, delays or restrictions in the Company\u2019s operations. For example, during October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion for the 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards. The EPA published a final rule in November 2017 that issued area designations with respect to ground-\nlevel ozone for approximately 85% of the U.S. counties as either \u201cattainment/unclassifiable\u201d or \u201cunclassifiable\u201d and is expected to issue non-attainment designations for the remaining areas of the U.S. not addressed under the November 2017 final rule in the first half of 2018. In a second example, in June 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cCorps\u201d) published a final rule that attempted to clarify federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act over waters of the United States, including wetlands, but legal challenges to this rule followed. The 2015 rule was stayed nationwide to determine whether federal district or appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear cases in the matter and, in January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. The EPA and Corps proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the June 2015 rule, announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the Clean Water Act\u2019s jurisdiction, and published a proposed rule in November 2017 specifying that the contested June 2015 rule would not take effect until two years after the November 2017 proposed rule was finalized and published in the Federal Register. Recently, on January 22, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction resides with the federal district courts; consequently, while implementation of the 2015 rule currently remains stayed, the previously-filed district court cases will be allowed to proceed. As a result of these recent developments, future implementation of the June 2015 rule is uncertain at this time. Any expansion to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act jurisdiction in areas where Company\u2019s operations are conducted could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of the Company\u2019s equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and increase the Company\u2019s capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business. In a third example, in response to a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency\u2019s failure to timely assess its Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d) Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in the Company\u2019s costs to manage and dispose of wastes generated from its operations, which could effect on the Company\u2019s operations and financial position. The Company may be unable to pass on increased compliance costs arising out of its activities as a result of these developments to its customers.\nThe Endangered Species Act and other restrictions intended to protect certain species of wildlife govern our oil and natural gas operations, which constraints could have an adverse impact on our ability to expand some of our existing operations or limit our ability to explore for and develop new oil and natural gas wells.\nThe federal Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d) and comparable state laws and other regulatory initiatives restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migrating birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Some of our operations may be located in or near areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species and, in these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse effects to protected species and their habitats, and we may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to our drilling activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. Moreover, as a result of one or more settlements approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency is required to make determinations on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to specific timelines. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures, time delays or limitations on our exploration and production activities, which costs, delays or limitations could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.\nEnactment of executive, legislative or regulatory proposals under consideration could negatively affect our business.\nNumerous executive, legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and natural gas industry have been introduced, are anticipated to be introduced, or are otherwise under consideration, by the President, Congress, state legislatures and various federal and state agencies. Among these proposals are: (1) proposed legislation (none of which has passed) to repeal various tax deductions available to oil and natural gas producers as discussed in more detail below and (2) the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act enacted in 2011, which increases penalties, grants new authority to impose damage prevention and incident notification requirements, and directs the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\u201cPHMSA\u201d) to prescribe minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines.\nThe foregoing described proposals, including other applicable proposals, could affect our operations and the costs thereof. The trend toward stricter standards, increased oversight and regulation and more extensive permit requirements, along with any future laws and regulations, could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions which could have an effect on the\nCompany, its operations, the demand for oil and natural gas, or the prices at which it can be sold. However, until such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted into law and thereafter implemented, it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or our results of operations and financial condition.\nRecently enacted changes to the U.S. federal tax laws could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegislation recently enacted in Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, made significant changes to U.S. tax laws. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (i) eliminates the deduction for certain domestic production activities, (ii) imposes new limitations on the utilization of net operating losses, (iii) eliminates the exception under Section 162(m) for qualified performance-based compensation, (iv) provides for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, which may impact the taxation of oil and natural gas companies. While past legislative proposals have included changes to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and natural gas companies, including (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures, these specific changes are not included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. This legislation or any future similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and production. We continue to examine the impact the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may have on us, and it could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to deduct interest expense incurred in our business may be limited.\nIn general, we are entitled to a deduction for interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to our trade or business during our taxable year. However, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, our deduction for \u201cbusiness interest\u201d is limited to the sum of our business interest income and 30% of our \u201cadjusted taxable income.\u201d For the purposes of this limitation, our adjusted taxable income is computed without regard to any business interest expense or business interest income, and in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, any deduction allowable for depreciation, amortization, or depletion.\nOur ability to deduct compensation paid to certain employees may be limited.\nSection 162(m) of the Code limits our ability to deduct certain compensation paid to covered employees (i.e., individuals currently serving or who have previously served, at any point after December 31, 2016, as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the three other highest compensated officers of the Company). Previously, Section 162(m) provided an exception for certain qualified performance-based compensation; however, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminates this exception (other than for compensation provided under certain grandfathered arrangements), and as a result, our ability to deduct certain amounts paid to our covered employees may be limited.\nLegal proceedings could result in liability affecting our results of operations.\nMost oil and natural gas companies, such as us, are involved in various legal proceedings, such as title, royalty, environmental or contractual disputes, in the ordinary course of business. We defend ourselves vigorously in all such matters, if appropriate.\nBecause we maintain a portfolio of assets in the various areas in which we operate, the complexity and types of legal proceedings with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. If we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flows. Legal proceedings could result in a substantial liability. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities related to our business. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations, damage to our properties and/or injuries. For example,\nunauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations.\nTo date we are not aware of any material losses relating to cyber-attacks, however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities.\nOur financial results are not comparable to our historical financial information prior to our emergence from bankruptcy as a result of the implementation of the plan of reorganization and the transactions contemplated thereby and our adoption of fresh start accounting.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy in 2016, we adopted fresh start accounting. Accordingly, our financial conditions and results of operations subsequent to emergence from bankruptcy are not comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in the Company\u2019s historical financial statements prior to our emergence from bankruptcy. Investors may find it more difficult to analyze the performance of the Company due to the limited comparable historical financial information.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nFunds associated with Strategic Value Partners LLC, (\"SVP\") and DW Partners, LP (\u201cDW\u201d) currently own approximately 38.9% and 14.4%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. SVP currently has a right to nominate two of our directors under our director nominating agreement. DW, together with other former noteholders who received our common stock pursuant to our plan of reorganization, collectively hold the current right to nominate two additional directors. Our current board is limited to seven directors under the terms of the director nomination agreement. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. Furthermore, we have entered into a director nomination agreement with each of SVP, DW and other former holders of our senior notes that provides for certain continuing nomination rights subject to conditions on share ownership. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the near future.\nWe do not anticipate that cash dividends or other distributions will be paid with respect to our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictive covenants in certain debt instruments to which we are, or may be, a party, may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to receive dividends from our operating companies, any of which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nA small number of institutional investors controls a significant percentage of our voting power and possess negative control or veto rights with respect to certain proposed Company transactions\nA small group of institutional investors, who are parties to our director nomination agreement currently, beneficially own a percentage majority of our issued and outstanding common stock. Consequently, such investors are able to strongly influence all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, changes to our organizational documents and approval of acquisition offers and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership limits our other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. In addition, the institutional holders that are parties to the director nomination agreement possess negative control or veto rights under the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation with respect to certain transactions the Company may propose to undertake for so long as such parties collectively hold 50% or more of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Such parties are entitled to notice of certain proposed transactions which may be vetoed if such parties who collectively hold at least 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock object to such action. These veto rights of the parties to the director nomination agreement apply to the following transactions:\n\u2022\nthe sale or other disposition of assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in any single transaction or series of related transactions, with a fair market value in the aggregate in excess of $75 million, other than certain intercompany ordinary course transactions;\n\u2022\nany sale, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, winding up, bankruptcy event, reorganization, consolidation, or merger of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissuing or repurchasing any shares of our common stock or other equity securities (or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities) in an amount that is in the aggregate in excess of $5 million, other than pursuant to employee benefit and incentive plans (including certain repurchases of capital stock to satisfy withholding or similar taxes in connection with any exercise of equity rights) and the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of our outstanding warrants;\n\u2022\nincurring any indebtedness for borrowed money (including through capital leases, the issuance of debt securities or the guarantee of indebtedness of another person or entity), in any single transaction or series of related transactions, that is in the aggregate in excess of $75 million other than indebtedness incurred to refinance indebtedness issued for less than $75 million, intercompany indebtedness, and certain other obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nentering into any proposed transaction or series of related transactions involving a \u201cChange of Control\u201d of the Company (for purposes of this provision, \u201cChange of Control\u201d shall mean any transaction resulting in any person or group (as such terms are defined in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) acquiring \u201cbeneficial ownership\u201d (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of more than 50% of the total outstanding equity interests of the Company (measured by voting power rather than number of shares);\n\u2022\nentering into or consummating any material acquisition of businesses, companies or assets (whether through sales or leases) or joint ventures, in any single transaction or series of related transactions, in the aggregate in excess of $75 million;\n\u2022\nincreasing or decreasing the size of the Board;\n\u2022\namending the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company; or\n\u2022\nentering into any arrangements or transactions with affiliates of the Company.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d) and our Bylaws and our existing director nomination agreement may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The provisions in our Charter and Bylaws and our existing director nomination agreement include, among other things, those that:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors\u037e\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board to issue preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval\u037e\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings\u037e\n\u2022\nprovide SVP and certain other institutional stockholders the right to nominate up to four of our directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nprovide veto rights to certain stockholders as detailed in our Charter, including any transaction that may constitute a change of control, as defined in the Charter.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of the Company to negotiate with our Board, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Furthermore, we have entered into a director nomination agreement with each of SVP, DW and other former holders of our senior notes that provides for certain continuing nomination rights subject to conditions on share ownership.", "PERMNO": 66739, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SBOW"}
