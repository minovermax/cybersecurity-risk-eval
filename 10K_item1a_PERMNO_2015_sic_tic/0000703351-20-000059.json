{"cik": "703351", "company": "BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe caution you that our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The risk factors listed below could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report, our other filings with the SEC, our news releases, or our other verbal or written communications. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting disruptions on our business and operations and in the risk factors below, additional risks and uncertainties that are currently not known or believed by us to be immaterial may also have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In any such event, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as those of many of our customers, suppliers, and local, national, and global economies. The COVID-19 pandemic has also amplified many of the other risks discussed below to which we are subject. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and its related impacts will adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations as well as our stock price. However, given the unpredictable, unprecedented, and fluid nature of the pandemic, it may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in ways that are not currently anticipated by or known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risk.\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has materially disrupted and is expected to continue to materially disrupt for an extended period of time our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse effect on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state and local government responses to COVID-19, our guests\u2019 responses to the pandemic, and our Company\u2019s responses to the pandemic have all disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business and our industry. In the United States, as well as globally, individuals are being encouraged to practice social distancing, restricted from gathering in groups, and in some areas are restricted from non-essential movements outside of their homes, all of which impacts our ability to operate our business.\nOur fiscal 2020 results include the decline in Company sales compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we temporarily closed all Company-owned restaurant dining and banquet rooms as we transitioned to an off-premise business model and temporarily delayed our expansion plans. Beginning on April 27, 2020, we began to reopen certain dining room locations as permitted by governments. At the end of fiscal 2020, as of June 24, 2020, and more recently as of our first period of fiscal 2021 ended July 29, 2020, 94.9% and 84.0%, respectively, of our Company-owned restaurant dining rooms or patios were open in a limited capacity.\nIn response to the pandemic, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we shifted to off-premise and then limited dining room re-opening based on regulatory requirements. We also modified work hours for our team members, implemented enhanced safety protocols, and identified and implemented cost savings measures throughout our operations. In fiscal 2020, we incurred approximately $12.2 million of expenses related to our response to the pandemic primarily related to employee relief payments, net of CARES Act employee retention tax credits, supplies such as sanitizer and face masks, and inventory spoilage. We expect to incur higher ongoing expenses related to additional cleaning and safety supplies for the duration of the pandemic. In response to the pandemic, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, certain landlords have provided temporary rent concessions. These concessions primarily relate to the deferral of certain fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 rent payments until future periods. However, we have not reached agreement with all landlords\nand, we cannot provide any assurances regarding whether similar concessions will be granted in the future. Refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2 - Novel Coronavirus Pandemic within Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the financial impact of the pandemic.\nBased on government mandates, it is also possible that we may have to close some or all of our re-opened dining rooms if the pandemic persists or worsens or if cases of COVID-19 increase in certain geographic areas, in each case reverting back to off-premise only model in such locations. We cannot predict the speed at which we will be able to re-open our dining rooms at full capacity, or whether we will be able to do so at all, as this will depend in part on the actions of a number of governmental bodies over which we have no control.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy in general, globally, nationally and locally, could also adversely affect our guests\u2019 financial condition, resulting in reduced spending at restaurants. The COVID-19 pandemic and these responses have affected and will continue to adversely affect our guest traffic, sales and operating costs and we cannot predict how long the pandemic will last or what other government responses may occur. Moreover, once restrictions are lifted, it is unclear whether guests will be comfortable dining out and, if so, how quickly guests will return to our restaurants, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety and/or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses, and other factors that are beyond our control. Any failure of consumers to return to pre-pandemic dining patterns could have a long-term material adverse impact on us and our future prospects.\nThe equity markets in the United States have been extremely volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so. If the business interruptions caused by COVID-19 continue indefinitely or last longer than we expect, we may need to seek other sources of liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant disruption and extreme volatility in global capital markets and is adversely affecting the availability of liquidity generally in the credit markets, and there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available on favorable terms, especially the longer the COVID-19 pandemic lasts, or available at all. As discussed in this report, we have amended our revolving credit facility to preserve liquidity and allow us financial flexibility, including waiving of certain debt covenant compliance for a limited time. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors voted to suspend the quarterly cash dividend and share repurchase program due to uncertainty surrounding the duration of closures of our dining rooms and other restrictions mandated by state and local governments in response to COVID-19. Additionally, under the terms of our revolving credit facility, as recently amended, we are prohibited from making dividends, stock repurchases and investments from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 through the third quarter of fiscal 2021, and following this period, we will be subject to a $50.0 million aggregate limitation on dividends, stock repurchases and investments. A material increase in our level of debt or material impairments of our assets could cause our debt to total cash flow ratio to exceed the maximum level permitted under the covenant in our revolving credit facility agreement.\nAdditionally, certain of our restaurants have been further disrupted when a team member has been diagnosed with COVID-19 or exposed to a person with a confirmed positive diagnosis of COVID-19. In the event a team member has been diagnosed with COVID-19, our policy requires temporary closure of the restaurant, quarantine of some or all of a restaurant\u2019s employees and disinfection of the restaurant facilities. Additionally, if a team member has direct contact with a friend or family member with a confirmed positive diagnosis of COVID-19, such team member must exclude himself or herself from work for a certain period of time. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our operations will be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. If an outbreak is traced to one or more of our locations, it could impact our reputation and subject us to legal claims. Additionally, we have implemented COVID-19 emergency pay policies and taken other employee compensation relief actions to support our restaurant team members during the COVID-19 business interruption, but those actions may not be sufficient to compensate our team members for the entire duration of any business interruption resulting from COVID-19. Those team members might seek and find other employment during that interruption, which could materially adversely affect our ability to properly staff and reopen our dining rooms with experienced team members when permitted to do so by governments.\nWe have not experienced any significant issues related to suppliers, however, our suppliers could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our suppliers\u2019 employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, or if the supply chain is disrupted for any other reason such as travel limitations and other restrictions on commerce, we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and our operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions.\nConsidering the significant uncertainty as to our ability to increase sales to levels we achieved before the COVID-19 pandemic based on aforementioned uncertainties and other known and unknown risks related to the pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1 - Business Part II, Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discussions on Liquidity for further information of our future growth. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A - Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted.\nCompetition may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nThe restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, convenience, and type and quality of food. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains. The casual dining segment of the restaurant industry has not seen significant growth in customer traffic in recent years, and seen a significant decrease as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If these trends continue, our ability to grow customer traffic at our restaurants (including through off-premise) will depend on our ability to increase our market share within the casual dining segment. We also face competition from quick service and fast casual restaurants; the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services; and meal kit and food delivery providers. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict. If we are unable to compete effectively, our gross sales, guest traffic and profitability may decline.\nChanges in consumer preferences may decrease demand for food at our restaurants.\nChanging health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The food service industry as a whole depends on consumer preferences at the local, regional, national and international levels. New information or changes in dietary, nutritional or health insurance guidelines, whether issued by government agencies, academic studies, advocacy organizations or similar groups, may cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our Company-owned restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.\nFood safety incidents at our restaurants or in our industry or supply chain may adversely affect customer perception of our brands or industry and result in declines in sales and profits.\nRegardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues at one of our restaurants or our franchisees\u2019 restaurants could irreparably damage our brand reputations and result in declines in customer traffic and sales at our restaurants. A food safety incident may subject us to regulatory actions and litigation, including criminal investigations, and we may be required to incur significant legal costs and other liabilities. Food safety incidents may occur in our supply chain and be out of our control. Health concerns or outbreaks of disease in a food product could also reduce demand for particular menu offerings. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry generally and adversely affect our sales or cause us to incur additional costs to implement food safety protocols beyond industry standards. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.\nGlobal and domestic economic conditions negatively impact consumer discretionary spending and could have a material negative effect on our financial performance.\nThe restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, which is negatively affected by global and domestic economic conditions, such as: slow or negative growth, unemployment, credit conditions and availability, volatility in financial markets, inflationary pressures, weakness in the housing market, tariffs and trade barriers, pandemics or public health concerns, and changes in government and central bank monetary policies. When economic conditions negatively affect consumer incomes, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, discretionary spending for restaurant visits will be challenged, our guest traffic may deteriorate and the average amount guests spend in our restaurants may be reduced. This will negatively impact our revenues and also result in lower royalties collected, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. This could result in further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures. There is no assurance that any governmental plans related to the economy to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will foster growth in consumer confidence, consumer incomes or consumer spending.\nUnfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand.\nMulti-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, customer complaints, litigation, illness or health concerns or other issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants, regardless of whether such events have a factual basis. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili\u2019s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili\u2019s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili\u2019s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of the internet. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.\nEmployment and labor laws and regulations may increase the cost of labor for our restaurants.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local employment and labor laws and regulations that govern employment and labor matters, including, employment discrimination, minimum wages, work scheduling, overtime, tip credits, tax reporting, working conditions, safety standards, family leave and immigration status. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity or litigation. Some states and localities have, and many others are contemplating, increases to their minimum wage and tip credit wage, and such increases can have a significant impact on our labor costs. Similarly, any government actions related to employee compensation or employer liability in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, whether temporary or permanent, could also materially increase our costs. In addition, new employment or labor laws may mandate additional benefits for employees or impose additional obligations that may adversely impact the costs of labor, the availability of labor and our business operations. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can offset all of the costs associated with compliance.\nGovernmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and which increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings. Among other laws and regulations, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the design and operation of facilities, minimum wage, licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies, nutritional content and menu labeling, including the Affordable Care Act, which requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain state and local jurisdictions are enacting certain health, safety and other regulations that impact or require us to modify our operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of these laws.\nWe are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative effect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the United States and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws and regulations which govern the offer and sale of franchises and which may supersede the terms of franchise agreements between us and our franchisees. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could adversely affect us and our franchisees. Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state, local, and international authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nIf we are unable to successfully design and execute a business strategy plan, our gross sales and profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to increase revenues and profitability is dependent on designing and executing effective business strategies. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nIncrease gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options desired by our guests;\n\u2022\nEvolve our marketing and branding strategies in order to appeal to guests;\n\u2022\nInnovate and implement technology initiatives that provide a unique digital guest experience;\n\u2022\nIdentify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including reimaging of existing restaurants, new restaurant development and new restaurant equipment;\n\u2022\nGrow and expand operations, including identifying available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants, or making strategic acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nImprove the speed and quality of our service.\nOur partnership with DoorDash is subject to risks, and our ability to grow sales through delivery orders is uncertain.\nOur strategy for growth in fiscal 2021 is dependent in part on increased sales from guests that want our food delivered to them. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we entered into an agreement with DoorDash that allows DoorDash to be the exclusive third party delivery provider for Chili\u2019s and Maggiano\u2019s. We currently rely on DoorDash for the ordering and payment platforms that receive guest orders and that send orders directly to our point of sale system. These platforms could be damaged or interrupted by technological failures, cyber-attacks or other factors, which may\nadversely impact our sales through these channels. DoorDash generally fulfills delivery orders through drivers that are independent contractors. These drivers may make errors, fail to make timely deliveries, damage our food or poorly represent our brands, which may lead to customer disappointment, reputational harm and unmet sales expectations. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if there is a shortage in drivers that are willing and available to make deliveries from our restaurants.\nBecause we have partnered exclusively with DoorDash, our delivery business and growth expectations may be negatively impacted if DoorDash is not able to effectively compete with other restaurant delivery providers for end consumers, capital, and delivery drivers or DoorDash ceases or reduces operations. Delivery, as well as other DoorDash offerings that we may test, are relatively new services, and it is difficult for us to anticipate the level of sales they may generate, operational challenges we may face or the experiences our guests will have with these offerings. These factors may adversely impact our sales and our brand reputation. We also incur additional costs associated with delivery orders, and it is possible that these orders could cannibalize more profitable in-restaurant visits or carry out orders.\nAdditionally, we have certain virtual brands that are only available through DoorDash. We rely on DoorDash to market and deliver certain offerings from our Chili\u2019s and Maggiano\u2019s kitchens. In addition to the delivery and technological risks discussed above, because certain offerings are only available through the DoorDash platform, if we have to transition to a different third party delivery provider, our sales on such offerings would temporarily be diminished, and it is possible that we would not generate the same level of profitability with a different provider.\nLoss of key management personnel could hurt our business and limit our ability to operate and grow successfully.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on our leadership team and other key management personnel. These personnel serve to maintain a corporate vision for our Company, execute our business strategy, and maintain consistency in the operating standards of our restaurants. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficiently experienced and capable key management personnel, our business and financial results may suffer.\nFailure to recruit, train and retain high-quality restaurant management and team members may result in lower guest satisfaction and lower sales and profitability.\nOur restaurant-level management and team members are largely responsible for the quality of our service. Our guests may be dissatisfied and our sales may decline if we fail to recruit, train and retain managers and team members that effectively implement our business strategy and provide high quality guest service. There is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. If we experience high turnover, we may experience higher labor costs and have a shortage of adequate management personnel required for future growth.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business.\nThere has been a marked increase in the use of social media and similar platforms which allow individual access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants\u2019 post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests and may harm our performance, prospects or business, regardless of the information\u2019s accuracy.\nAs part of our marketing strategy, we rely on search engine marketing, social media and new technology platforms to attract and retain guests and maintain brand relevance. Our strategy and initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without improvement in guest traffic or brand relevance. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.\nWe are exposed to risks related to cyber security and protection of confidential information, and failure to protect the integrity and security of payment card or individually identifiable information of our guests and teammates or confidential and proprietary information of the Company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues, increased costs and litigation.\nOur technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our guests and team members, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, and a significant portion of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. If our technology systems, or those of third party services providers we rely upon, are compromised as a result of a cyber-attack (including whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or social engineering) or other external or internal method, it could result in an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. The cyber risks we face range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to attacks that target us due to the confidential consumer information we obtain through our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions. Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us, as well as the imposition of penalties. These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack or to have failed to properly respond to an incident.\nTo conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national borders, and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. The use and disclosure of such information is regulated at the federal, state and international levels, and these laws, rules and regulations are subject to change and increased enforcement activity and are increasing in complexity and number. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, imposes new responsibilities on us for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for consumers who reside in California. The CCPA permits California to assess potentially significant fines for violating CCPA and creates a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations.\nAs privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur significant additional costs in technology, third-party services and personnel to maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber-attacks. As further described below, the Company experienced a cyber security incident at some Chili\u2019s locations in fiscal 2018. As a result of the incident, we have taken certain additional preventative measures to reduce cyber risks. However, we cannot provide assurance that our security frameworks and measures will be successful in preventing future cyber-attacks or data loss. In addition, we expect the cost to maintain cyber liability insurance in the future will materially increase as a result of the incident.\nWe have incurred and in the future may incur costs and reputational harm resulting from the unauthorized access or acquisition of confidential consumer information related to our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions.\nOn May 12, 2018, we issued a public statement notifying guests that we had discovered that credit and debit card numbers and related payment card information may have been acquired from Chili\u2019s locations without authorization as a result of a malware attack. The Company engaged third-party forensic firms and cooperated with law enforcement to investigate the matter. Based on the investigation of our third-party forensic experts, we believe most Company-owned Chili\u2019s restaurants were impacted by the malware during time frames that vary by restaurant, but we believe in each case began no earlier than March 21, 2018 and ended no later than April 22, 2018.\nAs a result of the incident, we have been assessed with financial responsibility by certain payment card companies for card issuer losses, card replacement costs and other charges issued by payment card companies. In addition, we are the defendant in a purported class action lawsuit, alleging that we negligently failed to provide adequate security to protect the payment card information of the plaintiffs, causing those individuals to suffer financial losses. In the future we may become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also become subject to additional lawsuits or proceedings relating to the incident. While we do not acknowledge responsibility to pay any such amounts imposed or demanded, these proceedings and demands may result in significant related settlement costs.\nSince the incident, through June 24, 2020, we have incurred total cumulative costs of $8.0 million related to the cyber security incident, and expect to incur primarily legal expenses associated with the incident in future periods. Although we maintain cyber liability insurance, we are not able to reliably forecast all of the losses that may occur as a result of the incident or whether such costs will be covered by insurance. If losses exceed our cyber liability insurance coverage such excess losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods. See Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the financial impact of this cyber security incident.\nFurther, the incident may have a negative impact on our reputation and cause guests to lose confidence in our ability to safeguard their information. We are unable to definitively determine the impact to our relationship with our guests and whether we will need to engage in significant promotional or other activities to rebuild our relationship with our guests. If the Company experiences another cyber security incident in the future, we believe it will be even more difficult to regain the trust of our guests and to rebuild our reputation.\nShortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues.\nPossible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather; natural disasters such as floods, droughts and hurricanes; shortages in the availability of truck drivers; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tight credit market; trade barriers; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; animal disease outbreaks; or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply-chain risk could increase our costs or reduce revenues and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.\nThe large number of Company-owned restaurants concentrated in Texas, Florida and California makes us susceptible to changes in economic and other trends in those regions.\nA high concentration of our Company-owned restaurants are located in Texas, Florida and California comprising 19.5%, 12.5% and 10.1%, respectively, as of June 24, 2020. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those states. Negative publicity, local economic conditions, health epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19), local strikes, energy shortages or extreme fluctuations in energy prices, droughts, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters in regions where our restaurants are highly concentrated could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For example, declines in oil prices may increase levels of unemployment and cause other economic pressures that result in lower sales and profits at our restaurants in oil market regions of Texas and surrounding areas.\nLitigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance.\nWe are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business or out of special circumstances. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food-borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the food service industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. It is also possible that team members, guests or others could make claims against the Company as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the nature and scope of such matters, if any, is unknown because the pandemic is novel. Our franchise activity also creates a risk of us being named as a joint employer of workers of franchisees for alleged violations of labor and wage laws. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe success of our franchisees is important to our future growth.\nWe have a significant percentage of system-wide restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to require our franchisees to maintain brand consistency, the franchise relationship reduces our direct day-to-day oversight of these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control. Our reputation and financial results may be negatively impacted by: franchisee defaults in their obligations to us; limitations on our ability to enforce franchise obligations due to bankruptcy proceedings or differences in legal remedies in international markets; franchisee failures to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; franchisee failures to meet obligations to pay employees; and franchisees\u2019 failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements.\nAdditionally, our international franchisees are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees, and royalties paid to us may decrease if their businesses are negatively impacted. These risks include:\n\u2022\nDifficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to United States operations;\n\u2022\nChanges to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;\n\u2022\nChallenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and\n\u2022\nDifferences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, cultural, social and political conditions.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR could increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on us.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility use LIBOR, the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market, as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. The Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom has announced that it plans to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. Whether another alternative reference rate attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. Although our borrowing arrangements provide for alternative base rates, those alternative base rates historically would often have led to increased interest rates, in some cases significantly higher, than those we paid based on LIBOR, and may similarly be higher in the future. Therefore, if, or when, LIBOR ceases to exist, we will likely need to agree upon a replacement index with our lenders as part of refinancing our existing indebtedness upon its maturity, and the interest rate thereunder will likely change.\nThe consequences of the phase out of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted at this time. For example, we may not be successful in amending our borrowing arrangements to provide for a replacement rate. If any new or alternative base rate for calculating interest with respect to our outstanding indebtedness may not be as favorable or perform in the same manner as LIBOR and could lead to an increase in our interest expense or could impact our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness. In addition, the transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in financial markets, which could also have an adverse effect on us whether or not any replacement rate applicable to our borrowings is affected. Any such effects of the transition away from LIBOR, as well as other unforeseen impacts, may result in increased interest expense and other expenses, difficulties, complications or delays in connection with future financing efforts or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit rating agencies have, and in the future may, change their credit rating for us, among other things, based on the performance of our business, our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding public debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be further lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. A downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things:\n\u2022\nIncrease our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nLimit our ability to access capital;\n\u2022\nResult in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur, including restrictions on our ability to pay distributions or repurchase shares;\n\u2022\nRequire us to provide collateral for any future borrowings; and\n\u2022\nAdversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, S&P lowered our corporate credit rating to B+ with negative outlook. Moody\u2019s also lowered us to a corporate family rating B1 with negative outlook. The downgrades were a result of the COVID-19 impact on the restaurant sector that has been one of the sectors most significantly affected given its sensitivity to consumer demand and sentiment, and the unprecedented precautionary measures implemented by state and local governments, including temporary closures. These ratings and our current credit condition affect, among other things, our ability to access new capital. Negative changes to these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt. Our credit ratings could be further lowered, or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. In particular, a weakening of our financial condition, including any further increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds, could result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook, or could otherwise increase our cost of borrowing.\nInflation and fluctuations in energy costs may increase our operating expenses.\nWe have experienced impact from inflation and fluctuations in utility and energy costs. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses. Fluctuations and increases in utility and energy costs have also increased our operating expenses on regional and national levels, including through suppliers putting pressure on margins by passing on higher prices for petroleum-based fuels. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu prices, or by implementing alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.\nChallenges to the retail industry may negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants.\nOther tenants at retail centers in which we are located or have executed leases may fail to open or may cease operations as a result of challenges specific to the retail industry, including competition from online retailers. The retail industry has been particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many locations closing for extended periods of time and have yet to reopen. A number of prominent retail chains have also declared bankruptcy, including those that are anchor tenants in retail centers where we have locations.\nDecreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers and changes in guest visits to the retail centers in which we are located, whether as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, may negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants.\nWe are dependent on information technology and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.\nWe rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations, and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations.\nAdditionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.\nFailure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.\nWe regard our Chili\u2019s\u00ae and Maggiano\u2019s\u00ae service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other entities. Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.\nWe outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.\nSome business processes are or may in the future be outsourced to third parties. Such processes include certain information technology processes, gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks to guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.\nDeclines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment tests in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. Although no triggering event had been identified in our regular goodwill impairment assessment performed at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we determined during the third of fiscal 2020 that the reduced cash flow projections and the significant decline in our market\ncapitalization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Based on our assessment during the third quarter we determined that our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired at that time. Additionally, we updated the assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and determined no triggering event existed based on improved market value and actual results compared to forecast for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. This assessment is predicated on our ability to continue to operate dining and banquet rooms, and generate off-premise sales at our restaurants. Management\u2019s judgment about the short and long term impacts of the pandemic could change as additional facts become known and therefore affect these conclusions. We will continue to monitor and evaluate our results and evaluate the likelihood of any potential impairment charges at our restaurants and reporting units.\nIt is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nChanges to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets.\nWe make certain estimates and projections with respect to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we recognized $14.5 million of long-lived asset and lease asset impairment charges as a result of decreased cash flows and it is possible that we may incur similar charges in greater amounts in the future. Refer to Note 2 - Novel Coronavirus Pandemic within Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The projection of future cash flows used in the analyses requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe are subject to the internal control requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our processes for designing and implementing effective internal controls involve continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business as well as in the economic and regulatory environments. As a result, we expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take as part of this effort will be sufficient to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in consolidated financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, or result in regulatory scrutiny, penalties or shareholder litigation, all of which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expenses, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies recently. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and\nlegal fees and divert management\u2019s and our board of directors\u2019 attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.\nFrom time to time we may implement measures that make it more difficult for an activist investor or potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire the Company through a merger or similar transaction. These measures may discourage investment in our common stock and may delay or discourage acquisitions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares over the then-current market price.\nOther risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOther risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements, include, without limitation, changes in financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates); increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) or the prospects of these events; changes in consumer behaviors; changes in demographic trends; labor shortages and availability of employees; union organization; strikes; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms); inadequate insurance coverage; and limitations imposed by our credit agreements.", "PERMNO": 23297, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "EAT"}
