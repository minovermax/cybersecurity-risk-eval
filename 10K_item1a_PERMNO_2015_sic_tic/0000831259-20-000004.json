{"cik": "831259", "company": "FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThis report contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of United States (U.S.) federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as plans, projections or expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates; production and sales volumes; unit net cash costs; operating cash flows; capital expenditures; our expectations regarding our share of PT Freeport Indonesia\u2019s (PT-FI) net (loss) income and future cash flows through 2022; PT-FI\u2019s development, financing, construction and completion of a new smelter in Indonesia; our expectations regarding results associated with productivity and innovation initiatives; exploration efforts and results; development and production activities, rates and costs; liquidity; tax rates; export quotas and duties; the impact of copper, gold and molybdenum price changes; the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings; reserve estimates; execution of the settlement agreement associated with the Louisiana coastal erosion cases; and future dividend payments, share purchases and sales.\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, expected, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following:\nFinancial risks\nFluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper, gold and molybdenum, have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our common stock and debt. Extended declines in the market prices of copper, gold and, to a lesser extent, molybdenum could adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and asset values and, if sustained, may adversely affect our ability to repay debt.\nOur financial results will vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper and gold, and to a lesser extent molybdenum. An extended decline in market prices of these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, the value of our assets and/or our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations; and may depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities.\nAdditionally, if market prices for our primary commodities decline for a sustained period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing production, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. We may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, in which case we may incur losses, and those losses may be material.\nFluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control, including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels; global economic and political conditions; international regulatory, trade and tax policies, including national tariffs; commodities investment activity and speculation; interest rates; the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies; the price and availability of substitute products; and changes in technology. Volatility in global economic growth, particularly in developing economies, has the potential to adversely affect future demand and prices for commodities. Geopolitical uncertainty, including the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit), and protectionism, have the potential to inhibit international trade and negatively impact business confidence, which creates the risk of constraints on our ability to trade in certain markets and has the potential to increase price volatility.\nCopper prices may be affected by demand from China, which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world, and by changes in demand for industrial, commercial and residential products containing copper. China\u2019s economy continues to struggle with rising debt levels, softening domestic consumer demand, the effects of a prolonged trade war, and more recently, the coronavirus outbreak, which has led to the temporary closure of some manufacturing activities in China. Although our sales to date have not been significantly affected, a continued slowing in China\u2019s economic growth, the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, changes in China-U.S. relations, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies are difficult to predict and could adversely affect copper prices, demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nCopper prices have fluctuated historically, with London Metal Exchange (LME) copper settlement prices ranging from $2.48 per pound to $3.29 per pound during the three years ended December 31, 2019. LME copper settlement prices averaged $2.72 per pound in 2019, $2.96 per pound in 2018 and $2.80 per pound in 2017. The LME copper settlement price was $2.79 per pound on December 31, 2019, and $2.53 per pound on January 31, 2020.\nFactors affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the U.S. dollar to other currencies, inflation and interest rate expectations, purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks, demand from China and India, two of the world\u2019s largest consumers of gold, and global demand for jewelry containing gold. The London PM gold price averaged $1,393 per ounce in 2019, $1,268 per ounce in 2018 and $1,257 per ounce in 2017. The London PM gold price was $1,515 per ounce on December 30, 2019 (there was no London PM gold price quote on December 31, 2019), and $1,584 per ounce on January 31, 2020.\nThe Metals Week Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price averaged $11.37 per pound in 2019, $11.93 per pound in 2018 and $8.21 per pound in 2017. The Metals Week Molybdenum Dealer Oxide weekly average price was $9.23 per pound on December 31, 2019, and $10.40 per pound on January 31, 2020.\nDeclines in prices of commodities we sell could result in metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our long-lived assets. Refer to Note 4 for additional information regarding metals inventory adjustments. Other events that could result in impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might have a material adverse effect on current and future expected mine production costs.\nOur debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nAt December 31, 2019, our total consolidated debt was $9.8 billion (see Note 8) and our total consolidated cash was $2.0 billion. We also have various other financial commitments, including reclamation and environmental obligations, take-or-pay contracts and leases. For further information, refer to the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations, and plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties. Although we have been successful in repaying debt in the past and issuing new debt securities in capital markets transactions, there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. In addition, we may assume additional debt in future periods or reduce our holdings of cash and cash equivalents in connection with funding existing operations, capital expenditures, dividends or in pursuing other business opportunities.\nOur level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nLimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nIncreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nLimiting our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and/or material contingencies, to engage in future development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt;\n\u2022\nRequiring us to sell assets to reduce debt; or\n\u2022\nPlacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments.\nAny failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt agreements. Our available cash and liquidity may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that may be accelerated upon an event of default.\nAs of January 31, 2020, our senior unsecured debt was rated \u201cBB\u201c with a stable outlook by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P), \u201cBB+\u201d with a stable outlook by Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and \u201cBa1\u201d with a stable outlook by Moody\u2019s Investors Service (Moody\u2019s). If we are unable to maintain our indebtedness and financial ratios at levels acceptable to these credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects deteriorate, our current credit ratings could be\ndowngraded, which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities and existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms and could increase our borrowing costs.\nCertain of our debt agreements, including our revolving credit facility, use the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021, which could cause market volatility or disruption. If LIBOR is unavailable after 2021, our debt with interest rates that are indexed to LIBOR will be determined using various alternative methods to the extent provided for in our agreements, which could result in increases in interest rates on such debt. Further, we may need to renegotiate our debt agreements and the loans that utilize LIBOR to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established by the U.S. Alternative Rate Reference Committee, which is currently expected to be the Secured Overnight Bank Financing Rate. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms, or the establishment of alternative reference rates on our borrowing costs or the capital markets generally.\nMine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations. We also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties, and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those properties. Changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so. Most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction, depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or similar state laws. Refer to Note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations.\nWe are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our remaining oil and gas properties under both state and federal laws, including financial responsibility required under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill. In 2016, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued revised requirements for lessees operating in federal waters to secure the cost of plugging, abandoning, decommissioning and/or removing wells, platforms and pipelines at the end of production. The revised requirements eliminate previously provided waivers from requirements to post security. In early 2017, the BOEM announced a delay in the implementation of certain aspects of the rules pending further review and in June 2017, BOEM further extended the start date for implementation indefinitely. This extension currently remains in effect. If implemented, the new requirements could require us to post security in the form of bonds or similar assurances. The cost for bonds or other forms of assurances can be substantial, and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our financial assurance obligations totaled $1.3 billion for closure and reclamation/restoration costs of U.S. mining sites, and $0.5 billion for plugging and abandonment obligations of our remaining oil and gas properties. A substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by FCX and subsidiary guarantees and financial capability demonstrations. Our ability to continue to provide guarantees and financial capability demonstrations depends on state and other regulatory requirements, our financial performance and our financial condition. Other forms of assurance, such as letters of credit and surety bonds, are costly to provide and, depending on our financial condition and market conditions, may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties.\nThe laws and regulations governing mine closure and remediation in a particular jurisdiction and oil and gas properties plugging and abandonment obligations are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental and asset retirement obligations to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. Refer to Notes 1 and 12, for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations.\nUnanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are involved in numerous legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues, including those described in Note 12 and in Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d involving matters such as remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, claims of personal injury or property damage arising from such contamination or from exposure to substances such as lead, arsenic, asbestos, talc and other allegedly toxic substances, disputes over water rights, and disputes with foreign governments or regulatory authorities over royalties, taxes, rights and obligations under concession or other agreements, or other matters. We are also involved periodically in other reviews, inquiries, investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In addition, from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at Superfund and other sites. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties, other sanctions or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs. Management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period.\nWe may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plans.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for certain current and former employees in the U.S. and a few pension plans for non-U.S. locations which provide for specified payments after retirement. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A sustained period of low or insufficient returns could require us to fund our pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. Refer to Note 9 for further discussion.\nInternational risks\nOur international operations are subject to political, economic, social and regional risks of doing business in countries outside the U.S.\nWe are a U.S.-based mining company with substantial assets located outside of the U.S. We conduct international mining operations in Indonesia, Peru and Chile and exploration activities in various foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the U.S., our business may be adversely affected by political, economic, social and regional uncertainties in each of these countries. Risks of conducting business in countries outside the U.S. include:\n\u2022\nDelays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, or the renegotiation, cancellation, revocation or forced modification of existing contracts, leases, licenses, permits or other agreements and/or approvals;\n\u2022\nExpropriation or nationalization of property, protectionism, or restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital;\n\u2022\nChanges in the host country\u2019s laws, regulations and policies (which may be applied retroactively), including, but not limited to, those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, duties, tariffs, divestment, imports, exports (including restrictions on the export of copper concentrates, copper and/or gold), trade regulations, currency and environmental matters (including land use and water use), which because of rising \u201cresource nationalism\u201d in countries around the world, may impose increasingly onerous requirements on foreign operations and investment;\n\u2022\nPolitical, social and economic instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil unrest, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;\n\u2022\nChanges in the aspirations and expectations of local communities in which we operate with respect to our contributions to employee health and safety, infrastructure and community development and other factors that may affect our social license to operate, all of which lead to increased costs;\n\u2022\nRisk of loss associated with trespass, local artisanal or illegal mining, theft and vandalism or due to potential pandemic and endemic health issues;\n\u2022\nChanges in U.S. trade, tax, immigration or other policies that may harm relations with foreign countries or result in retaliatory policies;\n\u2022\nIncreases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located;\n\u2022\nForeign exchange controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and inflation;\n\u2022\nReduced protection for intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nThe risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of an international court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation.\nOur insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks. Accordingly, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the U.S. may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international operations must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. There has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws in recent years. We operate in jurisdictions that have experienced public and private sector corruption and where significant anti-corruption enforcement activities, prosecutions, and settlements have occurred. There can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable laws and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, agents or contractors. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Any violation of anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with Indonesia and Peru tax authorities (refer to Note 12 for further discussion of these matters). Other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below.\nBecause our mining operations in Indonesia are a significant operating asset, our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in Indonesia.\nOur Indonesia mining operations include the Grasberg minerals district, one of the world\u2019s largest copper and gold deposits. These operations are conducted by our subsidiary PT-FI pursuant to a special mining license (IUPK) issued by the Indonesia government. Refer to Note 13 for a summary of the IUPK\u2019s key fiscal terms.\nMaintaining a good working relationship with the Indonesia government is important because of the significance of our Indonesia operations to our business, and because our mining operations there are among Indonesia\u2019s most significant business enterprises. The Grasberg minerals district has been designated by the Indonesia government as one of Indonesia\u2019s vital national assets. Partially because of its significance to Indonesia\u2019s economy, the environmentally sensitive area where it is located, and the number of people employed, our Indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the Indonesia press, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence. Improper management of our working relationship with the Indonesia government could lead to a disruption of operations and/or impact our reputation in Indonesia and in the region\nwhere we operate, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (PT Inalum), a shareholder in PT-FI, is an Indonesia state-owned enterprise. Disputes between us and PT Inalum may result in litigation or arbitration, which could increase our expenses and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and could create tensions with the Indonesia government.\nThe Indonesia mining industry is subject to extensive regulation within Indonesia, and there have been major developments in laws and regulations applicable to mining concession holders, some of which have conflicted with PT-FI\u2019s contractual rights in the past. In particular, the enactment of Law No. 4 of 2009 on Coal and Mineral Mining on January 12, 2009 (the Mining Law) replaced the previous regulatory framework which allowed concession holders, including PT-FI, to conduct mining activities in Indonesia under a contract of work system. The Mining Law, which sets out the regulatory framework for the mining industry in Indonesia, only contains substantive principles and leaves many specific issues to be addressed in implementing regulations, some of which have conflicted with PT-FI\u2019s contractual rights in the past, including, but not limited to, regulations that imposed a progressive export duty on copper concentrate, restricted exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes, increased royalty rates, and required payment of a smelter assurance bond to support a commitment to construct a new smelter in Indonesia (refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the smelter assurance bond). In January 2017, PT-FI suspended exports through April 2017 in response to these Mining Law regulations.\nThe Mining Law stipulated that previously granted mining rights (through a contract of work) would continue to be valid until expiry, subject to certain adjustments. PT-FI\u2019s former Contract of Work (COW) was concluded pursuant to the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law, which provided basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization, a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors. The initial term of PT-FI\u2019s former COW was scheduled to expire in 2021 and explicitly provided that it could be extended for two 10-year periods subject to Indonesia government approval, which could not be withheld or delayed unreasonably. Prior to the issuance of the IUPK to PT-FI in December 2018, PT-FI had been engaged in discussions with the Indonesia government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its former COW, including extending its term. Notwithstanding provisions in PT-FI\u2019s former COW prohibiting it from doing so, the Indonesia government sought to modify PT-FI\u2019s former COW to address provisions contained in the Mining Law and implementing regulations adopted thereunder, some of which were not required under or conflicted with PT-FI\u2019s former COW, including, but not limited to (i) restrictions on PT-FI\u2019s basic right to export mining products; (ii) imposition of additional export duties and higher royalty rates; (iii) imposition of excess surface water taxes (refer to Note 12); (iv) imposition of new requirement to build additional smelter capacity in Indonesia; (v) unreasonable withholding and delay in granting approval of two successive ten-year extensions of the term of the former COW; and (vi) imposition of new divestment requirements.\nIn early 2017, the Indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals, including copper concentrate and anode slimes, and other matters related to the mining sector. PT-FI\u2019s export license for copper concentrate is valid for one year periods, subject to review and approval by the Indonesia government every six months, depending on smelter construction progress. PT-FI\u2019s export license expires on March 8, 2020. The 2017 regulations also permit the export of anode slimes, which is necessary for PT Smelting (PT-FI\u2019s 25-percent-owned copper smelter and refinery located in Gresik, Indonesia) to continue operating. PT Smelting\u2019s export license for anode slimes expires on March 11, 2020. In addition to a delay in the renewal of its export license for anode slimes in 2017, PT Smelting\u2019s operations were shut down from mid-January 2017 until early March 2017 as a result of labor disturbances. Copper concentrate sales to PT Smelting totaled over 10 percent of our consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. We cannot predict when PT-FI\u2019s copper concentrate license and PT Smelting\u2019s anode slimes export license may be renewed. PT-FI\u2019s sale of concentrates could be interrupted if either of these export license is not timely renewed or if PT Smelting is unable to operate either due to other operational or financial constraints, which would adversely impact our revenues and operations.\nWe cannot assure you that future regulatory changes affecting the mining industry in Indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly repealed, or that new interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not be issued, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will not mine all of PT-FI\u2019s ore reserves in the Grasberg minerals district before the initial term of PT-FI\u2019s IUPK expires in 2031 and the IUPK may not be extended through 2041 if PT-FI fails to abide by the terms and conditions of the IUPK and applicable laws and regulations.\nOn December 21, 2018, PT-FI was granted an IUPK to replace its former COW, enabling PT-FI to conduct operations in the Grasberg minerals district through 2041. Under the terms of the IUPK, PT-FI has been granted mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend its mining rights through 2041, subject to, among other things, PT-FI completing the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia by December 21, 2023, and fulfilling its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government. Refer to Note 13 for a summary of the IUPK\u2019s key fiscal terms.\nThe IUPK also requires PT-FI to pay duties on concentrate exports of 5 percent, declining to 2.5 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 30 percent, and eliminated when smelter development progress exceeds 50 percent. Smelter development progress will be determined by an independent verifier appointed by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) and subject to approval by the MEMR. Engineering and front-end engineering and design for the selected process technology are ongoing, with construction of the smelter expected to begin in 2020. The preliminary capital cost estimate for the project approximates $3 billion, and PT-FI is pursuing financing and commercial arrangements for this project. The economics of the new smelter will be borne by PT-FI\u2019s shareholders according to their respective share ownership percentages. PT-FI\u2019s ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future market prices as well as PT-FI\u2019s operational performance, cash flow and debt position, among other factors. Financing may not be available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to PT-FI.\nOur proven and probable ore reserves in Indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and PT-FI\u2019s current long-term mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that PT-FI will abide by the terms and conditions of the IUPK and will be granted the 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041. As a result, we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the IUPK. Prior to the end of 2031, we expect to mine 52 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at December 31, 2019, representing 56 percent of our net equity share of recoverable copper reserves and 62 percent of our net equity share of recoverable gold reserves.\nIf PT-FI does not complete the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia by December 21, 2023, or fulfill its defined fiscal obligations to the Indonesia government as set forth in the IUPK, the IUPK will likely not be extended from 2031 to 2041, and we would be unable to mine all of PT-FI\u2019s ore reserves in the Grasberg minerals district, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nOperational risks\nOur mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business and our underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous.\nOur mines are very large in scale and, by their nature are subject to significant operational risks, some of which are outside of our control, and many of which are not covered fully, or in some cases even partially, by insurance. These operational risks, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flow, include earthquakes, rainstorms, floods, and other natural disasters; environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals; surface or underground fires; equipment failures; accidents, including in connection with mining equipment, milling equipment or conveyor systems, transportation of chemicals, explosives or other materials and in the transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites; wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments; lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates; and unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form).\nWe are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of some of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. No assurances can be given that unanticipated geotechnical and hydrological conditions may or may not occur, nor whether these conditions may lead to events such as landslides and pit wall failures, in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as seismic activity or severe weather, which may lead to floods, mudslides, pit-wall instability, and possibly even slippage of material. During the first quarter of 2019, our El Abra operation in Chile experienced heavy rainfall and electrical storms. As a result, our operating results for 2019 were impacted by a suspension of El Abra\u2019s crushed leach stacking operations\nfor approximately 35 days. We cannot predict whether similar events will occur in the future or the extent to which any such event would affect this, or any of our other operations.\nFor a discussion of risks specific to our tailings management, see below \u201cOur management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business.\u201d\nUnderground mining operations can be particularly dangerous, and in May 2013, a tragic accident, which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries, occurred at PT-FI when the rock structure above the ceiling of an underground training facility collapsed. PT-FI temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the Grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed open-pit mining and concentrating activities in June 2013, and underground operations in July 2013. No assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future.\nIn addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our Indonesia mining operations involve additional\nrisks given their location in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of Indonesia. These conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. The area also receives extreme rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. Further, the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time.\nWe maintain insurance to cover some of these risks and hazards; however, our insurance may not sufficiently cover losses from an unexpected natural or operating disaster. We maintain insurance in amounts that are believed to be reasonable depending on the circumstances surrounding the identified risk. No assurance can be given that such insurance will continue to be available, or that it will be available at economically feasible premiums, or that we will be able to obtain or maintain such insurance. In addition, we do not have coverage for certain environmental losses and other risks, as such coverage cannot be purchased at a commercially reasonable cost. The lack of, or insufficiency of, insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flow and overall profitability.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development of and production from mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, significant repair costs, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, extensive community disruption, loss of licenses, permits or necessary approvals to operate, loss of infrastructure and services, disruption to essential supplies or delivery of our products, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.\nOur management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business.\nThe waste rock (including overburden) and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste material. Managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks primarily relating to structural stability, geochemistry, water quality and dust generation. Management of this waste is regulated in the jurisdictions where we operate and our programs are designed to be in compliance with applicable national, state and local laws, permits and approved environmental impact studies.\nWe maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material, which are effectively large embankments that must be engineered, constructed and monitored to ensure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse. Our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions, and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations. In Indonesia, we use a river transport system for tailings management, which presents other risks discussed in more detail below under Environmental Risks - \u201cOur Indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs.\u201d\nAffiliates of our company currently operate 18 tailings storage facilities, 16 in the U.S. and 2 in Peru; and manage 58 in the U.S. that are inactive or closed (approximately three-fourths of the inactive facilities have been closed). Our inventory of tailings storage facilities comprises 13 active and 52 inactive or closed facilities with an upstream design, 5 active and 5 inactive with a centerline design, and 1 closed facility with a downstream design. In 2019, the Company produced approximately 309 million metric tons of tailings. The failure of tailings and other embankments\nat any of our mining operations could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life, as well as adverse effects on our business and reputation. Many of our tailings storage facilities are located in areas where a failure has the potential to impact individual dwellings and a limited number of impoundments are in areas where a failure has the potential to impact nearby communities or mining infrastructure. As a result, our programs take into account the significant consequences resulting from a potential failure, and we apply substantial financial resources and both internal and external technical resources to the safe management of all those facilities. Our tailings management and stewardship program, which involves qualified external Engineers of Record and periodic oversight by independent tailings Technical Review Boards and our Tailings Stewardship Team, complies with the tailings governance framework on preventing catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities adopted in December 2016 by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and required to be implemented by ICMM members. We continue to enhance our existing practices and work with ICMM on additional initiatives to strengthen the design, operation and closure of tailings storage facilities in an effort to reduce the risk of severe or catastrophic failure of those facilities. However, no assurance can be given that these events will not occur in the future.\nThe importance of careful design, management and monitoring of large impoundments has been emphasized in recent years by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines, which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property and environmental damage. As a result of recent failures, international groups are drafting standards that management may elect to implement at our tailings storage facilities. These standards, if implemented, could require changes to our tailings stewardship program and approaches, although it is uncertain if these changes would result in material capital or operating cost increases.\nBased on observations from such recent tailings failures, in addition to fatalities and severe personal, property and environmental damages, these events could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, decrease in reserves, legal liability (possibly involving the freezing of assets), government investigations, additional regulations and restrictions on mining operations in response to any such failure, increased monitoring costs and production costs, increased insurance costs or inability to obtain insurance, increased costs and/or limited access to capital, remediation costs, inability to comply with any additional safety requirements or obtain necessary certifications, evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nLabor unrest, violence, activism and civil and religious strife could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 37 percent of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 21 percent of our global labor force was covered by agreements that have expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire during 2020.\nLabor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis, and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. If we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers, we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected. Refer to Items 1. and 2. \u201cBusiness and Properties\u201d for additional information regarding labor matters, and expiration dates of such agreements.\nWe could experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations. For example, during third-quarter 2016, PT-FI experienced labor productivity issues and a 10-day work stoppage that began in late September 2016. These labor productivity issues continued during fourth-quarter 2016 and the first half of 2017. Beginning in mid-April 2017, PT-FI experienced a high level of worker absenteeism, which unfavorably impacted mining and milling rates. A significant number of employees and contractors elected to participate in an illegal strike action beginning in May 2017, and were subsequently deemed to have voluntarily resigned under existing Indonesia laws and regulations resulting in increased costs associated with employee severance. We cannot predict whether additional labor disruptions will occur. Significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes or disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nSouth American countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability. During 2019, both Peru and Chile experienced significant and prolonged civil unrest unrelated to our operations. Production and sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were impacted by protests associated with an unaffiliated copper development project in Peru that blocked access to the shipping ports and main transportation routes. While the civil unrest did not significantly impact our results for 2019, if it continues, our South America operations could be materially impacted, and as a result, we may not be able to meet our production and sales targets. We cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents of civil unrest will occur in the future in Peru or Chile.\nIndonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. Several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of Papua, where our Grasberg minerals district is located. In Papua, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the Indonesia military and police. In addition, illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities. Social, economic and political instability in Papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our Indonesia operations.\nIn 2009, a series of shooting incidents occurred within the PT-FI project area, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations. The shooting incidents continued on a sporadic basis through January 2015. During this time, there were 20 fatalities and more than 50 injuries to our employees, contractor employees, government security personnel and civilians. The next shooting incident occurred in August 2017, and a series of shooting incidents continued on a sporadic basis within the PT-FI project area and in nearby areas through January 2020, resulting in 2 fatalities and 25 injuries. In December 2018, a mass shooting incident targeting a highway construction crew occurred in a remote mountain area approximately 100 miles east of the PT-FI project area, resulting in at least 19 fatalities and several reported as missing. Separatist security incidents, including shootings, continue to be sporadically reported, and PT-FI continues to monitor the occurrence of incidents in the region.\nThe safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and PT-FI continues to work with the Indonesia government to address security issues within the PT-FI project area and in nearby areas. We continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys, including transport of personnel by armored vehicles in designated areas.\nWe cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our operations. If other disruptive incidents occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time.\nOur mining operations depend on the availability of significant quantities of secure water supplies.\nOur mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities, and related support facilities. Most of our North America and South America mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant. Continuous production at our mines is dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies.\nAs discussed in Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d in Arizona, where our operations use both surface and groundwater, we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which Arizona courts have been attempting, for over 40 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the Gila River, one of the state\u2019s largest river systems. This stream adjudication primarily affects our Morenci, Safford and Sierrita mines. The adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users, including us, as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users. Groundwater is treated differently from surface water under Arizona law, which historically allowed landowners to pump subsurface water, subject only to the requirement of putting it to \u201creasonable use.\u201d However, court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that some underground water constitutes \u201csubflow\u201d that is to be treated legally as surface water and is therefore subject to the Arizona doctrine of prior appropriation and subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims. Any re-characterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers, farmers, ranchers, municipalities, and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades. Because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in Arizona, we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings. Given the legal and technical complexity of these adjudications, their long history, and their long-term legal, economic and\npolitical implications, it is difficult to predict the timing or the outcome of these proceedings. If we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications, our ability to pump groundwater could be diminished or curtailed, and our operations at Morenci, Safford and Sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative resources.\nWater for our Cerro Verde operation in Peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the Rio Chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation. As a result of occasional drought conditions, temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our Cerro Verde operations.\nWater for our El Abra mining operation in Chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascot\u00e1n aquifer. In 2010, El Abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the Salar de Ascot\u00e1n aquifer for its sulfide processing plant, which began operations in 2011. The agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer level to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping. If impact occurs, we would have to reduce pumping to restore water levels, which could have an adverse effect on production from El Abra.\nAlthough we typically have sufficient water for our Indonesia operations (the area receives considerable rainfall that has led to periodic floods and mudslides), lower rainfall could affect our water supply availability from time to time.\nAlthough each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands, as discussed above, some supplies are subject to adjudication proceedings, the outcome of which we cannot predict, and the availability of additional supplies that may be required for potential future expansions is uncertain. While we are taking actions to acquire additional back-up water supplies, such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost, or at all, so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations.\nDevelopment projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business. The development of our underground mines and operations are also subject\nto other unique risks.\nMine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. Currently, our major projects include underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district, which currently constitutes approximately 31 percent of our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper reserves, and completion of the Lone Star copper leach project in Arizona. There are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including, but not limited to, unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions, potential delays, cost overruns, lower levels of production during ramp-up periods, shortages of material or labor, construction defects, breakdowns and injuries to persons and property. The development of our underground mines and operations are also subject to other unique risks including, but not limited to, underground fires or floods, ventilating harmful gases, fall-of-ground accidents, and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions. While we anticipate taking all measures that we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with the development of our underground mines to safely manage production, there is no assurance that these risks will not cause schedule delays, revised mine plans, injuries to persons and property, or increased capital costs, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning, approval and review processes, many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside of our control, which may cause us to underestimate the time and capital required to complete a development project.\nFor example, we experienced mining induced seismic activity in 2017 and 2018 at the Deep Mill Level Zone (DMLZ) underground mine in the Grasberg minerals district. Results to date of hydraulic fracturing activities to manage rock stresses and pre-condition the DMLZ underground mine for large-scale production have been effective. However, we cannot predict whether additional occurrences of seismic activity or other unexpected geological activity will occur that could cause schedule delays or additional revisions to PT-FI\u2019s mine plans, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must continually replace reserves depleted by production but exploration is highly speculative and our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries.\nOur existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations. Because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations, our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our long-term success. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties, requires substantial capital expenditures, and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. We may not be able to discover, enhance, develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels, which could negatively affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nEstimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.\nOur estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves have been calculated in accordance with Industry Guide 7 as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral reserves. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on the average prices for the commodities we produce, primarily copper, gold and molybdenum, and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. Our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. We conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. We revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. Geological assumptions about our mineralization that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.\nEstimates of proven and probable reserves that will be recovered, or the cost at which we anticipate reserves will be recovered, are based on uncertain assumptions. The uncertain global financial outlook may affect economic assumptions related to reserve recovery and may require reserve revisions. Changes to reserve estimates could affect our asset carrying values and may also negatively impact our future financial condition and results.\nIn addition, if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline from recent levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease, or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, we can offer no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our estimated proven and probable reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the term \u201cmineralized material\u201d does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Estimates of mineralized material are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and/or underground sampling to support the reported tonnage and average metal grades. Such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs, unit costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the estimated mineralized material not included in reserves will become proven and probable reserves.\nOur operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations, some of which require permits and other approvals. These regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority. As a mining company, compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business. For additional information, see \u201cEnvironmental risks\u201d below. We are also subject to extensive regulation of worker\nhealth and safety, including the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions. In the U.S., the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Additionally in the U.S. various state agencies have concurrent jurisdiction arising under state law that regulate worker health and safety in both our industrial facilities and mines. If regulatory inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures. Refer to Exhibit 95.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding certain orders and citations issued by MSHA for our operations during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nMany other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. In addition, new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. Any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is dependent upon information technology systems, which may be adversely affected by disruptions, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nOur industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies. Our strategy of operating large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets has been increasingly dependent on our ability to become fully integrated and highly automated. Many of our business and operational processes are heavily dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct day-to-day operations, improve safety and efficiency, and lower costs.\nAs our dependence on information systems, including those of our third party service providers and vendors, grows, we become more vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency and magnitude. These incidents may include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, phishing, credential attacks, unauthorized access to data and other advanced\nand sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats, including threats that increasingly target critical operational\ntechnologies and process control networks. If any of these threats materialize, we could be subject to manipulation\nor improper use of our systems and networks, production downtimes, communication interruption or other disruptions and delays to our operations or to the transportation of products or infrastructure utilized by our operations, unauthorized release of proprietary, commercially sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data, significant health and safety consequences, environmental damage, loss of intellectual property, fines and litigation, damage to our reputation or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. We have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. While these cybersecurity incidents did not result in any material loss to us or interrupt our day-to-day operations, there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such losses in the future. Given the unpredictability of the timing and the evolving nature and scope of information technology disruptions, the various procedures and controls we use to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our potential risks to such threats may not be sufficient in preventing cybersecurity incidents from materializing. Further, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats.\nWe could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIn addition, from time to time, we pursue investments and initiatives to improve the productivity and efficiency of existing systems and operations, including through investments in digital technologies. During 2019, we advanced initiatives in our North America and South America mining operations to enhance productivity, expand margins and reduce the capital intensity of the business through the utilization of new technology applications in combination with a more interactive operating structure. The pilot program initiated at the Bagdad mine in northwest Arizona in late 2018 utilizes data science, machine learning and integrated functional teams to address bottlenecks, provide cost benefits and drive improved overall performance. There can be no certainty that some or any of such\ninvestments and initiatives will meet our capital allocation objectives. In addition, certain of such investments and initiatives are still in the early stages of evaluation, and additional engineering and other analysis is required to fully assess their impact. Further, there can be no certainty as to the time required for us to extract value from these investments or initiatives, or that we will achieve any anticipated savings or efficiency improvements.\nEnvironmental risks\nOur operations are subject to complex, evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities.\nOur operations, both in the U.S. and internationally, are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including mine closures and reclamation; well plug and abandonment requirements; protection of endangered and protected species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. In addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start, continue and expand operations.\nOur Miami, Arizona, smelter processes approximately half of the aggregate copper concentrate produced by our North America copper mines. EPA regulations required us to invest approximately $230 million in 2017 for new pollution control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) to meet both regional haze requirements and to allow the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) to demonstrate compliance with EPA\u2019s SO2 ambient air quality standards. During 2019 and January 2020, there were several instances in which the SO2 levels exceeded the ambient standard. We are engaged in discussions with ADEQ and conducting an ongoing investigation of the cause of the ambient levels. We cannot guarantee that we will not be required to modify our systems or install additional equipment to address findings, new requirements or for other reasons, which could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.\nLaws such as CERCLA and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations, or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing, recycling or disposal. As discussed in more detail in the next risk factor, we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by Freeport Minerals Corporation (FMC) and certain of its affiliates. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities. In addition, compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, as well as other factors.\nNew or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed, many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business, including those regarding financial assurance in the financial risk factor above. For example, criteria for man-made organic compounds that could be present in soil, groundwater and surface water at our existing and former operations are currently under review by federal and state agencies.\nIn 2015, EPA and the Department of the Army (collectively, the Agencies) adopted rules that added remote \u201ctributaries\u201d into the regulatory definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d that are protected by the Clean Water Act, thereby imposing significant additional restrictions on land uses in remote areas with only tenuous connections to active waterways. These rules were challenged by multiple states and industry parties and litigation is ongoing. On October 22, 2019, the Agencies published a final rule that repeals these 2015 rules and recodifies the regulations in place prior to adoption of the 2015 rules. EPA also published a proposed rule on February 14, 2019, which revises the definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d to clarify the scope of waters federally regulated under the Clean Water Act. The final rule will become effective 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register. This final rule could limit or eliminate our need to obtain federal permits for future expansions at our operations in Arizona and New Mexico. We expect multiple legal challenges to the rule to be filed in federal district courts.\nRegulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase federal financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation and for oil and gas decommissioning. In 2019, legislation was enacted in Colorado that eliminates our ability to use parent company guarantees, and requires proof of an end date for water treatment as a condition of permit issuance authorizing mining operations, with some exceptions for existing operations. Adoption of similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing\nregulations may materially increase our costs, threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities.\nOur mining operations are subject to regulations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) that are intended to protect species listed by the Department of Interior\u2019s Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) as endangered or threatened, along with critical habitat designated by FWS for these listed species. The regulations limit the ability of landowners, including us, to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations, and may also affect our ability to obtain, retain or deliver water to some operations. On August 27, 2019, FWS published final rules that mitigate, but do not eliminate, potential regulatory constraints on mining operations under the ESA. FWS is also evaluating whether certain species should still be listed under the ESA, and reconsidering critical habitat that was proposed but never finalized. Environmental groups have aggressively challenged FWS\u2019s regulatory reforms. No assurances can be made that restrictions relating to conservation will not have an adverse impact on expansion of our operations or not result in delays in project development, constraints on exploration and constraints on operations in impacted areas.\nWe incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners\u2019 shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling $0.4 billion in both 2019 and 2018, and $0.5 billion in 2017. For 2020, we expect to incur approximately $0.5 billion of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs. The timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters.\nWe incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years.\nFMC and its subsidiaries, and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies, have been involved in exploration, mining, milling, smelting and manufacturing in the U.S. for more than a century. Activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before American industrial companies fully understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment.\nWith the passage of CERCLA in 1980, companies like FMC became legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances, irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it. That liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners, operators and arrangers, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is, and each arranger may be, held fully responsible for the remediation, although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. As a result, because of our acquisition of FMC in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the U.S., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. We are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources. At December 31, 2019, we had more than 100 active remediation projects in 24 U.S. states. In addition, FMC and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters, and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $1.6 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to CERCLA or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of operating facilities.\nOur environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon:\n\u2022\nOur knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago;\n\u2022\nOur beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and\n\u2022\nOur beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates.\nSignificant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. The actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material.\nIn addition, remediation standards imposed by EPA and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future. Imposition of more stringent remediation standards, particularly for arsenic and lead in soils, poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies, and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation.\nEPA is considering how to reduce lead exposure in the environment under multiple environmental programs. Certain federal and state health agencies also support lower lead cleanup levels. The timing for these EPA activities is unclear, but any reduction in lead cleanup levels could result in material increases to our environmental reserves for ongoing residential property cleanup projects near former smelter sites.\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations.\nOur Indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs.\nMining operations on the scale of our Indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. Our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and silver-bearing materials from the ore that we mine. In 2019, PT-FI produced approximately 39 million metric tons of tailings. Our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the Indonesia government, uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area. Lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands.\nAnother major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore. In the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals that, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment. In addition, certain overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall, with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area; this additional material influences the deposition of finer sediment material in the estuary, as well as presents the potential for increased environmental impacts. The Grasberg overburden stockpiles have experienced significant erosion, exacerbated by unanticipated work stoppages that adversely affected our ability to manage certain overburden stockpiles, which may have resulted in adverse environmental impacts. The current tailings deposition management plan as well as environmental monitoring programs take into account the presence of this overburden in the lowlands tailings management area. As part of this effort, PT-FI has expanded the scope of its studies and analysis to assess the environmental impacts from the overburden erosion, including conducting risk assessments to determine whether any such impacts require additional monitoring or mitigation measures, which would result in increased costs.\nIn the past, certain Indonesia government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition. Because our Indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would be costly, difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to catastrophic failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. Based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will not have overtopping or levee failure caused by extreme weather events or unanticipated structural failure in the future, which could result in flooding of the nearby communities. If flooding were to occur, it could result in loss of lives, severe personal, property and environmental damages, which could necessitate evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, financial assistance to the communities impacted, remediation costs to repair and compensate for the social, cultural and economic impacts.\nIn December 2018, Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the MOEF) issued a revised environmental permit to PT-FI to address many of the operational activities that it alleged were inconsistent with earlier studies. PT-FI and the MOEF also established a new framework for continuous improvement in environmental practices in PT-FI\u2019s operations, including initiatives that PT-FI will pursue to increase tailings retention and to evaluate large scale beneficial uses of tailings within Indonesia. In addition, PT-FI continues to work with MOEF to finalize environmental permitting related to the rail facilities and certain of the underground mining production operations as well as permitting for the extension of levees to contain the lateral flow of tailings in the lowlands. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion.\nWe cannot assure you that future environmental changes affecting the mining industry in Indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly altered or repealed, or that new interpretations of existing environmental laws and regulations will not be issued, which might have a significant impact on PT-FI.\nOur copper mining operations require significant energy and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations.\nOur copper mining operations require significant energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. Energy represented approximately 20 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2019, and is expected to approximate 20 percent in 2020.\nCarbon-based energy is a significant input in our operations, although haul truck diesel use and the amount of purchased power that is derived from fossil fuel or renewable sources varies significantly depending on site production and country-specific circumstances. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. As a result of the Paris Agreement reached during the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015, a number of governments have pledged \u201cNationally Determined Contributions\u201d to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., several states, including Colorado and New Mexico, have advanced goals reducing or eliminating fossil-fuel based energy production. The administration of President Trump has announced the intention of the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which begins a lengthy process that will not be completed until November 2020. Transitions to renewable and other energy sources could, among other things, increase our operating and energy costs depending on the scope and magnitude of increased regulation of fossil-fuel based energy production, including greenhouse gas emissions.\nOther risks\nOur holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders\u2019 ability to receive dividends.\nWe are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. Cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the U.S.\nIn addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us or repay loans to us, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements, or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders.\nOur rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries\u2019 assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries\u2019 creditors, including any trade creditors.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. These provisions:\n\u2022\nAuthorize the Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;\n\u2022\nEstablish advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nLimit who may call stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nRequire the approval of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock to enter into certain business combination transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including if the consideration to be received by our common stockholders in the transaction is deemed to be a fair price.\nThese provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the Board.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us.\nThese provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 81774, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "FCX"}
