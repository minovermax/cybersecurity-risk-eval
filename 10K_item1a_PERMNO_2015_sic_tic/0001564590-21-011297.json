{"cik": "1324272", "company": "Ruths Hospitality Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company and its business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations. If any of these certain risks and uncertainties were to actually occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline and its investors may lose all or part of their investment. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Operate and Grow Our Business\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business, which has and could continue to materially affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations for an extended period of time.\nThe government responses related to COVID-19 across the world and our Company\u2019s responses to the outbreak have disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business. In the United States, containment efforts to slow the transmission of the virus that have been mandated by federal, state and local governments, include encouraging individuals to practice social distancing, restricting gathering in groups, and, in some areas, completely restricting individuals from non-essential movements outside of their homes. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak and these changing conditions, we closed the dining rooms in each of our Company-owned and managed restaurants during the month of April and transitioned our services to take-out and delivery operations in 69% of our restaurants. As of December 27, 2020, 70 of the 77 Company-owned and -managed restaurants were open, which included 51 restaurants offering limited capacity dining service and 19 restaurants offering take-out and delivery service only. As of December 27, 2020, seven Company-owned restaurants were temporarily closed. If the COVID-19 pandemic reaccelerates and federal, state and local governments impose restrictions again, we may again be forced to close some or all of our dining rooms, which would cause us to lose revenue and incur additional expenses. We have closed certain restaurants, modified work hours for our Team Members and identified and implemented cost savings measures throughout our operations. The COVID-19 outbreak and these responses have affected and will continue to adversely affect our revenue and operating margin and we cannot predict how long the outbreak will last or what other government responses may occur.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has also adversely affected our ability to open new restaurants. Due to the uncertainty in the economy and to preserve liquidity, we paused all construction of new restaurants and major remodel projects at existing restaurants in fiscal year 2020. These changes may materially and adversely affect our ability to grow our business, particularly if these construction pauses are in place for a significant amount of time.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we may be unable to secure additional liquidity. To improve our liquidity position, we have fully drawn the $115 million capacity of our revolving credit facility. If we fail to comply with our financial covenants, including a monthly liquidity covenant through June 2021, and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result. There can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms to the Company in the future. The equity markets in the United States have been volatile due to the COVID-19 outbreak and the Company\u2019s stock price has fluctuated significantly. Continued volatility in the equity markets and our stock price could negatively impact our ability to raise capital.\nOur operations could be further disrupted if large numbers of our employees or members of our senior management team are diagnosed with COVID-19. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our operations may be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Team Members might seek and find other employment during the COVID-19 business interruption, which could materially adversely affect our ability to properly staff and re-open our restaurants with experienced Team Members when the business interruptions caused by COVID-19 abate or end.\nOur suppliers could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. If our suppliers\u2019 employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and our operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions. The Company took measures to reduce payments to its landlords and vendors during fiscal year 2020 and is still in discussions with approximately 20% of its landlords to reduce its payments. We are unable to predict the outcome of these discussions and the extent to which we will be able to negotiate to reduce or modify rent obligations. With rent payments being delayed, landlords may terminate our leases or could take other actions that restrict our ability to access or re-open our stores in a timely manner. As of December 27, 2020, we were engaged in legal proceedings with six landlords or former landlords. We have pursued or continue to pursue these matters vigorously but there can be no assurance that we will prevail in litigation. The Company negotiated with its vendors during fiscal year 2020 to secure reductions and deferrals on obligated payments while its locations were operating in take-out and delivery status. These negotiations were concluded prior to the end of fiscal year 2020.\nWe have transitioned some of our employees, primarily home office support functions, to work remotely in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We are prepared to operate in this manner for the foreseeable future, if necessary. While we have business continuity procedures in place to guide our response to a crisis, our attention may be diverted away from normal operations and our resources may be constrained.\nAdditional government regulations or legislation due to COVID-19, in addition to decisions we have made and may make in the future, relating to the compensation of and benefit offerings for our restaurant Team Members could also have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness. We cannot predict the types of additional government regulations or legislation that may be passed relating to employee compensation due to COVID-19 outbreak.\nWe could experience other potential impacts due to COVID-19 pandemic that are not completely known at this time, including, but not limited to, charges from potential adjustments and impairment charges to the carrying amount of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets. We have incurred impairment charges and could incur additional impairment charges in the future. Our actual results may differ materially from the Company\u2019s current estimates as the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, depending largely though not exclusively on the duration of the disruption to our business.\nA lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants, the inability to renew leases at existing restaurants on similar terms and conditions, or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nThe success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations. All but one of our Company-owned restaurant premises are leased. If we do not renew leases when the lease terms expire, or if we are unable to renew leases on favorable terms and conditions, our operating results could be negatively impacted. Possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could also result in reduced sales in those restaurants. Desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation. In addition, construction costs for new locations may fluctuate. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nOur strategy to open franchisee-owned restaurants subjects us to extensive government regulation, compliance with which might increase our investment costs and restrict our growth.\nWe are subject to the rules and regulations of the FTC and various international and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC requires that we furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information and can restrict our ability to sell franchises. A number of states also regulate the sale of franchises and require the obtaining of a permit and/or registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities and the delivery of the franchise disclosure document to prospective franchisees. Non-compliance with those laws could result in governmental enforcement actions seeking a civil or criminal penalty, rescission of a franchise, and loss of our ability to offer and sell franchises in a state, or a private lawsuit seeking rescission, damages and legal fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe terms of our senior credit agreement may restrict our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies.\nOur senior credit agreement contains, and any agreements governing future indebtedness would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. Our senior credit agreement, as amended, which was entered into on February 2, 2017, limits our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\npay dividends or purchase stock in excess of the limits permitted under the credit facility;\n\u2022\nborrow money or issue guarantees;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nuse assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\nsell assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\ncreate or permit restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make payments to us.\nOur ability to engage in these types of transactions is limited even if we believe that a specific transaction would contribute to our future growth or improve our operating results. Our senior credit agreement also requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events outside of our control. Any non-compliance would result in a default under our senior credit agreement and could result in our lenders declaring our senior debt immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, consolidated results of operations and liquidity.\nWe pay interest under our senior credit agreement based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other LIBOR tenors.\nWhile this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. In light of these recent announcements, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist. While our senior credit agreement includes a mechanism for an alternate rate to LIBOR, there is no guarantee that the discontinuance of LIBOR will not result in financial market disruptions or significant increases in benchmark interest rates or borrowing costs, any of which may have an adverse effect on us.\nWe depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future.\nHistorically, we have relied upon external sources of capital to fund our working capital and other requirements. Currently, we utilize our senior credit agreement to fund a portion of our working capital and other financing requirements. Any non-compliance with any restrictive or financial covenants in our senior credit agreement could result in a default and could result in our lenders declaring our senior debt immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, consolidated results of operations and liquidity.\nIf we are required to seek other sources of capital, additional capital may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the market\u2019s perception of our current and potential future earnings. Furthermore, additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders\u2019 interests. If we are unable to access sufficient capital or enter into financing arrangements on favorable terms in the future, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nFood safety and food-borne illness concerns throughout the supply chain may have an adverse effect on our business.\nFood safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety risks are common throughout the restaurant industry and cannot be eliminated. Food safety issues could be caused by food suppliers, distributors or franchisees and, as a result, be out of our control. In addition, regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illness such as E. coli, norovirus, hepatitis A, trichinosis, shigella, typhoid fever or salmonella, and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brand and have a negative impact on our sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or other food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.\nIf our vendors or distributors do not deliver food and beverages in a timely manner we may experience supply shortages and/or increased food and beverage costs.\nOur ability to maintain consistent quality throughout Company-owned restaurants depends in part upon our ability to purchase USDA Prime and Choice grade beef, seafood and other food products in accordance with our rigid specifications. During fiscal year 2020, the country experienced supply disruptions due to closures of processing locations necessitated in the meat packing industry due to workforce COVID-19 infections. The Company purchased additional supplies of beef as a precaution against potential supply disruption. The Company did not experience any disruption during the fiscal year 2020 and was able to purchase substantially all of the beef used in Company-owned Ruth\u2019s Chris restaurants from two vendors, Sysco Specialty Meat Group (a subsidiary of Sysco) and Stock Yards Packing (a subsidiary of US Foods). Each vendor supplied about half of the Company\u2019s beef requirements.\nIn addition, we currently have a long-term distribution arrangement with a national food and restaurant supply distributor, DMA, which purchases products for us from various suppliers, and through which each of our Company-owned Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House restaurants receive a significant portion of their food supplies. Consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may change the relationships we have with our existing vendors and distributors and/or result in fewer alternative supply sources for purchasing our food supplies, which could result in an increase in prices. If for any reason our vendors or distributors cease doing business with us, we could experience supply shortages in certain Company-owned restaurants and could be required to purchase supplies at higher prices until we are able to secure an alternative supply source. Any delay we experience in replacing vendors or distributors on acceptable terms could increase food costs or, in extreme cases, require us to temporarily remove items from the menu at one or more Company-owned restaurants.\nLabor shortages or increases in labor costs could slow our growth or harm our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain employees with the qualifications to succeed in our industry and the motivation to apply our core service philosophy, including regional operational managers, restaurant general\nmanagers and chefs. If we are unable to continue to recruit and retain sufficiently qualified individuals, our business and growth could be adversely affected. Competition for these employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs.\nIn addition, we have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid wage rates at or based on the federal or state minimum wage and who rely on tips as a large portion of their income. Governmental entities have acted to increase minimum wage rates in several jurisdictions where Company-owned restaurants are located. The federal minimum wage may be increased and there likely will be additional minimum wage increases implemented in other states in which we operate or seek to operate. Likewise, changes to existing tip credit laws (which dictate the amounts an employer is permitted to assume an employee receives in tips when calculating the employee\u2019s hourly wage for minimum wage compliance purposes) continue to be proposed and implemented at both the federal and state government levels. The current federal proposal would increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour over the next four years. The State of Florida, where the Company has a significant number of restaurants, recently voted to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour over the next six years. As federal and/or state minimum wage rates increase and allowable tip credits decrease, we may need to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to our employees who are paid above the minimum wage, which will increase our labor costs. Proposals on paid sick leave could also increase our labor costs. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit. Should some of our employees elect to be represented by a collective bargaining unit, our labor costs may increase due to higher wage rates and/or the implementation of work rules. We may be unable to increase our prices to pass these increased labor costs on to our guests, in which case our margins would be negatively affected.\nRegulations affecting the operation of our restaurants could increase operating costs and restrict growth.\nEach of our restaurants must obtain licenses from regulatory authorities allowing us to sell liquor, beer and wine, and each restaurant must obtain a food service license from local health authorities. Each restaurant\u2019s liquor license must be renewed annually and may be revoked at any time for cause, including violation by the Company or its employees of any laws and regulations relating to the minimum drinking age, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control. One of our locations was cited for a violation in fiscal year 2018 and was penalized by a two-week closure in fiscal year 2019.\nIn certain states, including states where we have a large number of restaurants or where we may open restaurants in the future, the number of liquor licenses available is limited and licenses are traded at market prices. If we are unable to maintain existing licenses, or if we choose to open a restaurant in those states, the cost of a new license could be significant. Obtaining and maintaining licenses is an important component of each of our restaurant\u2019s operations, and the failure to obtain or maintain food and liquor licenses and other required licenses, permits and approvals would materially adversely impact existing restaurants or our growth strategy.\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal and state labor laws, pertaining to matters such as minimum wage and overtime pay requirements, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates and citizenship requirements. Government-mandated increases in minimum wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence, mandated health benefits, COVID related labor regulations, or increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities or a reduction in the number of states that allow tips to be credited toward minimum wage requirements could increase our labor costs and reduce our operating margins. In addition, the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination based on disability in public accommodations and employment. Although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled, we could be required to make modifications to our restaurants to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for, disabled persons.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations and a failure to maintain a continuous and secure network, free from material failure, interruption, or security breach, could harm our ability to effectively operate our business, damage our reputation and negatively affect our operations and profits.\nWe rely on information systems across our operations, including for marketing programs, point-of-sale processing systems in our restaurants, online purchases of gift cards and various other processes and transactions. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, delays in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a material network breach in the security of these systems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure network could adversely affect our reputation, negatively affect our results of operations, subject us to litigation or action by regulatory authorities and result in substantial harm to us or an individual. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change and cyber risks evolve, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance, to protect guest, employee and Company information. We currently carry insurance coverage to protect ourselves against some of these risks. However, our inability to continue to obtain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe accept electronic payment cards, including credit, debit and gift cards, from our guests for payment in our restaurants and on our websites. We also receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and employees. Most of our sensitive data, including information related to employees, guests, credit cards, gift cards and financial statements, is stored or processed by third-party vendors. We, and some of our vendors, have experienced breaches but they have not had a material impact on operations or our financial position. If we, or one of our vendors, experienced a material security breach, we could become subject to claims, lawsuits\nor other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the theft of credit or debit card information, theft of gift card information, compromised security and information systems, failure of our employees to comply with applicable laws, the unauthorized acquisition or use of such information by third parties, or other similar claims.\nWe frequently defend against unauthorized attempts to breach our network, but we are not aware of a major security breach. We employ both internal and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our systems, controls, firewalls and encryption and intend to maintain and upgrade our security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage, security breaches or other disruptive problems. In April 2020, we received a cyber threat from an anonymous source. We engaged a third party to assess the threat and confirmed that our IT systems were secure. We continuously monitor data security and evaluate our network for known security breaches. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, to disable or degrade service, or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or successfully implement adequate preventive security measures. There can also be no assurance that we would detect a cyber incident or prevent cyberattacks from penetrating our systems. Any such incidents or proceedings could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations, cause delays in guest service, require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, and could result in the imposition of penalties or cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenditures, including those necessary to remediate any damage to persons whose personal information may have been compromised. Furthermore, because of legislative and regulatory rules, we may be required to notify employees or the owners of the credit and debit card information of any data breaches, which could harm our reputation and financial results, as well as subject us to litigation or other proceedings by regulatory authorities.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully with other restaurants, which could reduce revenues.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to price, service, location, food quality, atmosphere and overall dining experience. Our competitors include a large and diverse group of well-recognized upscale steakhouse and upscale casual restaurant chains, including steakhouse and seafood chains as well as restaurants owned by independent local operators. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources, and may be better established in the markets where our restaurants are or may be located. If we cannot compete effectively in one or more of our markets, we may be unable to maintain recent levels of comparable restaurant sales growth and/or may be required to close existing restaurants.\nRisks Related to Financial Performance or General Economic Conditions\nIncreases in the prices of, or reductions in the availability of, any of our core food products could reduce our operating margins and revenues.\nWe purchase large quantities of beef, particularly USDA Prime grade beef, which is subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand and other factors. Our beef costs represented approximately 45% of our food and beverage costs during fiscal year 2020. We typically buy our beef on the \u201cspot\u201d market and from time to time we will enter into longer term pricing and supply agreements. As of December 27, 2020, we have negotiated set pricing on approximately 65% of our beef supply through March 2021 at an expected savings of approximately 15% in the first fiscal quarter of 2021 compared to current market prices. The market for USDA Prime grade beef is particularly volatile. If prices increase, or we are unsuccessful in our long-term pricing and supply agreements, or the supply of beef is reduced, our operating margins could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the production, processing or interstate distribution of meat and poultry products is prohibited absent federal inspection. If there is a disruption to the meat inspection process, we could experience a reduction in supply and a corresponding increase in meat prices, which could be significant, either of which could materially impact our operating margin and results of operations.\nIn the recent past, certain types of seafood have experienced fluctuations in availability. Seafood is also subject to fluctuations in price based on availability, which is often seasonal. If certain types of seafood are unavailable, or if our costs increase, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAn impairment in the financial statement carrying value of our goodwill, other intangible assets or property could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nGoodwill and owned franchise rights must be reviewed for potential impairment annually and when triggering events are detected. We performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and franchise rights as of November 29, 2020 using a qualitative assessment. Using the qualitative approach, we evaluated factors, including but not limited to: recent financial performance, forecasts for future cash flows, the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization, recent impairment tests, legal factors, the business climate, and the competitive environment.\nWe review property and equipment, which includes leasehold improvements, and operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired. We test for impairment using historical cash flow, forecasts and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows. The analysis is performed quarterly at the restaurant level for indicators of impairment. In determining future cash flows, we make significant estimates with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over the expected remaining life of the primary asset in the restaurant.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the financial statement carrying value of goodwill, other intangible assets or property and equipment become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nWe cannot assure our stockholders that we will resume quarterly cash dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. Failure to resume payment of quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders or repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we discontinued paying quarterly cash dividends to holders of our common stock and ceased the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program due to impacts from COVID-19. Our ability to pay future quarterly cash dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock will be subject to, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, any new indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. There can be no assurance that we will resume payment of a quarterly cash dividend or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Moreover, our failure or inability to resume paying quarterly cash dividends at historical levels could result in a lower market valuation of our common stock.\nLocal conditions, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of violence, terrorism or civil unrest, could adversely affect our business.\nCertain of the regions in which we operate (including Florida and California where we have a significant number of restaurants) have been, and may in the future be, subject to adverse local conditions, events, terrorist attacks, adverse weather conditions, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and wildfires. Any of the foregoing events may result in physical damage, temporary or permanent closure, lack of an adequate work force, or temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of food, beverages, electric, water, sewer and waste disposal services necessary for our restaurants to operate. Depending upon its magnitude, any of the foregoing could severely damage our restaurants and/or adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe currently maintain property and business interruption insurance through the aggregate property policy for each of our company-owned locations. However, if there is a major disaster, such coverage may not be adequate. In addition, upon the expiration of our current insurance policies, adequate insurance coverage may not be available at reasonable rates, or at all.\nWe have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature (including hurricanes and other natural disasters) including back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support restaurant operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.\nThe cost of our employee health care benefit program may increase in the future.\nWe maintain an employee benefits program that provides self-insured and insured coverage to employees that meet the applicable requirements under the program. Employees can elect to enroll dependents that meet eligibility criteria. Coverage includes health, dental, vision, short- and long-term disability, life insurance and other voluntary ancillary benefits. Employees share in the cost of other coverage at varying levels. The Company has historically funded a majority of the cost of health benefits.\nThe Company routinely reviews its health benefit plans to assure conformity with government regulations. Approximately 68% of eligible employees elect to participate in our health benefit plans. The \u201chours of service\u201d eligibility criteria for the Company\u2019s health benefits plan are lower than those required by law. In the future, proportionately more employees may elect to participate in our health benefit plans. We are unable to reliably predict to what extent, if any, the percentage of eligible employees who elect health care coverage will increase in the future. Because we fund a majority of the cost of health benefits, our financial accounting expense will increase to the extent that additional employees elect to participate in the Company\u2019s health benefit plans.\nCertain other restaurant companies may curtail the ability of their employees to participate in their health benefit plans by increasing the hours worked eligibility requirement to the minimum required under the ACA. Such restaurant companies may gain a cost advantage compared to us by reducing the cost of their employee health benefit programs.\nAlso, medical inflation has historically tended to outpace general inflation. We are unable to reliably predict the extent to which future medical inflation will outpace general inflation. Additionally, because our medical benefit program is self-insured, an unusual incidence of large claims may cause our costs to unexpectedly increase.\nEconomic downturns or changes in consumer confidence may adversely impact consumer spending patterns.\nEconomic downturns have in the past and could in the future negatively impact consumer spending patterns. Any decrease in consumer spending patterns may result in a decline in our operating performance. Economic downturns may reduce guest traffic and require us to lower our prices, which reduces our revenues and operating income, which may adversely affect the market price for our common stock. In addition, some of our restaurants are located in areas that we consider tourist or vacation destinations. In those locations, we depend in large part on vacation travelers to frequent our Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House restaurants, and such destinations typically experience a reduction in visitors during economic downturns, thereby reducing the potential guests that could visit our restaurants. A significant portion of our gross revenue comes from business guests and private dining which could also be negatively affected during an economic downturn or decrease in consumer confidence. This could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth strategy. Disasters occurring at one of our franchisee\u2019s locations could impact our reputation and our consumers\u2019 perception of our brand. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending on the severity, globally, which could adversely impact our operating results. In fiscal year 2020 the COVID-19 outbreak caused a global economic downturn. As of March 2021, multiple variants of the COVID-19 virus are circulating globally that are highly transmissible, and there is uncertainty around vaccine effectiveness on the new strains of the virus. Uncertainty around vaccine distribution, supply and effectiveness will impact when the negative economic effects as a result of COVID-19 will abate or end and the timing of such recovery may affect our financial condition.\nLitigation concerning food quality, health, employment practices and other issues could require us to incur additional liabilities and/or cause guests to avoid our restaurants.\nOccasionally, our guests file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants. We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees, claims from landlords, claims from suppliers, claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, harassment and discrimination and similar matters. In addition, we could become subject to class action lawsuits related to these matters in the future. These actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination; guest discrimination; food safety issues including poor food quality, food-borne illness, food tampering, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of various food productions or high-calorie foods. We, and other companies in the restaurant industry, have also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their guests. In addition, we are subject to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes. These statutes generally permit a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. The restaurant industry has also faced recent claims related to sexual harassment. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment that significantly exceeds our insurance coverage for any claims or for matters not covered by insurance could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our inability to continue to obtain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Adverse publicity or a failure to respond effectively resulting from these claims may also negatively impact our reputation and revenues at one or more of our restaurants.\nTax assessments or unclaimed property audits by governmental authorities could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe remit a variety of taxes and fees to various governmental authorities, including federal and state income taxes, excise taxes, franchise taxes, property taxes, sales and use taxes, and payroll taxes. The taxes and fees remitted by us are subject to review and audit by the applicable governmental authorities, which could result in liability for additional assessments. In addition, we are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period. We are subject to audits by individual U.S. states regarding our escheatment practices. The legislation and regulations related to tax and unclaimed property matters tend to be complex and subject to varying interpretations by both government authorities and taxpayers. Although management believes that the positions are reasonable, various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the positions we have taken, which may also potentially result in additional liabilities for taxes, unclaimed property and interest in excess of accrued liabilities. Our positions are reviewed as events occur such as the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, the conclusion of tax audits, the measurement of\nadditional estimated liability based on current calculations, the identification of new tax contingencies, or the rendering of relevant court decisions. An unfavorable resolution of assessments by a governmental authority could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows in future periods. The Company has a pending voluntary disclosure agreement with the State of Delaware to resolve potential liability surrounding gift cards.\nMarket volatility could adversely affect our stock price.\nMany factors affect the trading price of our stock, including factors over which we have no control, such as reports on the economy or the price of commodities, as well as negative or positive announcements by competitors, regardless of whether the report relates directly to our business. In addition to investor expectations, trading activity in our stock can reflect the portfolio strategies and investment allocation changes of institutional holders. Any failure to meet market expectations, whether for sales growth rates, earnings per share or other metrics, could adversely affect our share price. During fiscal year 2020, COVID-19 was a source of volatility in the financial markets. This volatility also impacted the Company\u2019s stock price.\nIn the future we could incur unexpected expenses resulting from the sale of the Mitchell\u2019s Restaurants.\nEffective January 21, 2015, we sold the Mitchell\u2019s Restaurants and related assets to Landry\u2019s, Inc. and Mitchell\u2019s Entertainment, Inc., an affiliate of Landry\u2019s Inc. (together with Landry\u2019s Inc., \u201cLandry\u2019s\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, upon closing of the sale of the Mitchell\u2019s Restaurants, Landry\u2019s assumed the lease obligations of the Mitchell\u2019s Restaurants. However, we have guaranteed Landry\u2019s lease obligations aggregating $22.7 million under five of the leases which extend until the leases terminate which may continue into 2040 assuming all options are exercised. Separate from the purchase agreement, Landry\u2019s has agreed to indemnify the Company in the event of a default under any of the leases. There is a risk that adverse events may occur that require us to defend against or fulfill an indemnity claim, which could result in unexpected expense.\nRisks Related to Our Brand\nNegative publicity surrounding our brand, the consumption of beef generally, or shifts in consumer tastes, could reduce sales in one or more of our restaurants and make our brand less valuable.\nOur success depends, in large part, upon the reputation of our brand. Negative publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns, or operating problems including disappointing customer experiences related to one or more restaurants, have occurred in the past, could occur in the future, and could make our restaurants less appealing to consumers. Further, the influence of social media could make it more difficult for us to respond to negative publicity in a timely or effective manner. Consumers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us the opportunity for redress or correction. In addition, any shifts in consumer preferences away from the kinds of food we offer, particularly beef, whether because of environmental, dietary or other health concerns or otherwise, would make our restaurants less appealing and adversely affect revenues. Our restaurants are required to disclose calorie information on menus, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nOur franchisees could take actions that harm our reputation and reduce our royalty and restaurant revenues.\nWe do not exercise control over the day-to-day operations of our franchisee-owned restaurants. While we strive to ensure that franchisee-owned restaurants maintain the same high operating standards that we demand of Company-owned restaurants, one or more of these restaurants may fail to maintain these standards or provide a customer experience consistent with our brand standards. Any operational or financial shortcomings of the franchisee-owned restaurants are likely to be attributed to our system-wide operations and could adversely affect our reputation and damage our brand as well as have a direct negative impact on the royalty income we receive from those restaurants. Franchisee noncompliance with the operational standards and the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements may reduce the overall goodwill of our brand, whether through the failure to meet health and safety standards, engage in quality control or maintain product consistency, adequate succession planning or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices. Moreover, unauthorized third parties may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of the Company\u2019s brand, resulting in consumer confusion or dilution. Any harm to our brand or goodwill, customer confusion or brand dilution could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe expansion into international markets by our franchisees also creates additional risks to our brands and reputation.\nOur international operations are subject to all the same risks associated with our domestic operations, as well as numerous additional risks. These include, among other things, international economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and differing cultures and consumer preferences. We are also subject to governmental regulation in such international markets, including antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, COVID-19 related regulations, import/export/customs regulations and other\ninternational trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Any new regulatory or trade initiatives could impact our operations in certain countries. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to enforce our service marks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position or the value of our brands.\nWe own certain common law service mark rights and a number of federal and international service mark registrations, most importantly the Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House names and logos, copyrights relating to text and print uses, and other proprietary intellectual property rights. We believe that our service marks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our success and competitive position. Protective actions we take with respect to these rights may fail to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others, which could harm our reputation, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal expenses.", "PERMNO": 90871, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "RUTH"}
