{"cik": "746515", "company": "EXPEDITORS INTERNATIONAL OF WASHINGTON INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nDISCUSSION AND POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE\nInternational Trade\nThe Company primarily provides services to customers engaged in international commerce. Everything that affects international trade has the potential to expand or contract the Company\u2019s primary market and adversely impact its operating results. For example, international trade is influenced by:\n\u2022 currency exchange rates and currency control regulations;\n\u2022 interest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022 changes in governmental policies, such as taxation, quota restrictions, other forms of trade barriers and/or restrictions and trade accords;\n\u2022 changes in and application of international and domestic customs, trade and security regulations;\n\u2022 wars, strikes, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, and other conflicts;\n\u2022 natural disasters and pandemics;\n\u2022 changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own;\n\u2022 changes in availability of credit;\n\u2022 changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleum-related products; and\n\u2022 increased global concerns regarding working conditions and environmental sustainability.\nThird Party Service Providers\nAs a non-asset based provider of global logistics services, the Company depends on a variety of asset-based third party providers. The quality and profitability of the Company depend upon effective selection, management and discipline of third party providers. In recent years, many of the Company\u2019s third party service providers have incurred significant operating losses and are highly leveraged with debt. Changes in the financial stability, operating capabilities and capacity of asset-based carriers and space allotment made available to the Company by asset-based carriers could affect the Company in unpredictable ways. Any combination of reduced airfreight or ocean freight capacity, pricing volatility or more limited carrier transportation schedules could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to maintain historical profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s freight carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment, which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Future regulatory developments in the U.S. and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in transportation industries, which in turn could increase the Company\u2019s purchased transportation costs. If the Company is unable to pass such costs on to its customers, its business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nPredictability of Results\nThe Company is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting short-term customer requirements. However, long-term customer satisfaction depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to meet these unpredictable short-term customer requirements. Personnel costs, the Company\u2019s single largest expense, are always less flexible in the very near term as the Company must staff to meet uncertain demand. As a result, short-term operating results could be disproportionately affected.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand, and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon just-in-time production schedules. Therefore, the timing of the Company\u2019s revenues are, to a large degree, impacted by factors out of the Company\u2019s control, such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods, product launches and/or manufacturing production delays. Additionally, many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter, and therefore, the Company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter. To the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts or investors, any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts or investors could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nForeign Operations\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s revenues and operating income comes from operations conducted outside the United States. To maintain a global service network, the Company may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations.\nIn addition, the Company operates in parts of the world where common business practices could constitute violations of the anti-corruption laws, rules, regulations and decrees of the United States, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and of all other countries in which the Company conducts business; as well as trade control laws, or laws, regulations and Executive Orders imposing embargoes and sanctions; and anti-boycott laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, regulations and decrees is dependent on the Company\u2019s employees, service providers, agents, third party brokers and customers, whose individual actions could violate these laws, rules, regulations and decrees. Failure to comply could result in substantial penalties and additional expenses, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and restrictions on its ability to conduct business.\n| 8.\nRISK FACTORS\nDISCUSSION AND POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE\nKey Personnel\nThe Company is a service business. The quality of this service is directly related to the quality of the Company\u2019s employees. Identifying, training and retaining key employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability. Effective succession planning is an important element of the Company's programs. Failure to ensure an effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder the Company's ability to execute on its business strategies and level of service. Senior management of the Company includes employees with long tenures, many of whom are approaching retirement age and some of whom announced their retirement in 2014. The loss of the services of one or more key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. The Company must continue to develop and retain management personnel to address issues of succession planning.\nThe Company believes that its compensation programs, which have been in place since the Company became a publicly traded entity, are one of the unique characteristics responsible for differentiating its performance from that of many of its competitors. Significant changes to its compensation programs could affect the Company\u2019s performance and ability to attract and retain key personnel. Continued loyalty to the Company will not be assured by contract.\nTechnology\nThe Company relies heavily and must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing its core businesses. Future results depend upon the Company's success in the cost effective development, maintenance and integration of secure communication and information systems technologies, including those acquired from and maintained by third parties. As the Company and its customers continue to increase reliance on these systems and as additional features are added, the risks also increase. The Company has begun upgrading many of its systems, including core operations and accounting. This process is inherently complex and if not managed properly could lead to disruptions in the Company's operations. The Company has implemented processes and procedures to mitigate these risks; however, these measures cannot assure the prevention of a serious negative event in the future.\nAny significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s global systems or the Internet for any reason, which could include equipment or network failures, power outages, sabotage, employee error or other actions, cyber-attacks or other security breaches, geo-political activity or natural disasters, would have a material negative effect on the Company's results and could include loss of revenue, business disruptions including the inability to timely process shipments, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential information, legal claims and proceedings, reporting delays or errors, interference with regulatory reporting, significant remediation costs, an increase in costs to protect the Company's systems and technology and damage to its reputation.\nGrowth\nThe Company has historically relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition. Future results will depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to anticipate and adapt to constantly evolving supply chain requirements and innovations. To continue to grow organically, the Company must gain profitable market share and successfully develop and market new service offerings. When investment opportunities arise, the Company\u2019s success will be dependent on its ability to evaluate and integrate the acquisitions.\nRegulatory Environment\nThe Company is affected by ever increasing regulations from a number of sources in the United States and in foreign locations in which the Company operates. Many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation and increase the Company's costs. The current business environment tends to stress the avoidance of risk through regulation and oversight, the effect of which is likely to be unforeseen costs and potentially unforeseen consequences.\nIn reaction to the continuing global terrorist threat, governments around the world are continuously enacting or updating security regulations. These regulations are multi-layered, increasingly technical in nature and characterized by a lack of harmonization of substantive requirements amongst various governmental authorities. Furthermore, the implementation of these regulations, including deadlines and substantive requirements, is driven by political urgencies rather than the industries\u2019 realistic ability to comply.\nFailure to consistently and timely comply with these regulations, or the failure, breach or compromise of the Company\u2019s policies and procedures or those of its service providers or agents, may result in increased operating costs, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, restrictions on operations and/or fines and penalties.\n| 9.\nRISK FACTORS\nDISCUSSION AND POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE\nCompetition\nThe global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. There are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry, but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited. Many of these competitors have significantly more resources than the Company. Depending on the location of the shipper and the importer, the Company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities, including some carriers. The primary competitive factors are price and quality of service. Many larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers. Customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service, pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms, higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties. Increased competition and competitors' acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues, reduced margins, higher operating costs or loss of market share, any of which would damage the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nTaxes\nThe Company is subject to many taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In many of these jurisdictions, the tax laws are very complex and are open to different interpretations and application. Tax authorities frequently implement new taxes and change their tax rates and rules, including interpretations of those rules. The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits, including transfer pricing inquiries, could be materially different from the Company\u2019s tax provisions and accruals and negatively impact its financial results.\nLitigation/Investigations\nAs a multinational corporation, the Company is subject to formal or informal investigations or litigation from governmental authorities or others in the countries in which it does business. These investigations and other periodic investigations may require management time and could cause the Company to incur substantial additional legal and related costs, which may include fines and/or penalties that could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and operating cash flows.\nThe Company may also become subject to other civil litigation arising from such investigations or litigation, including but not limited to shareholder class action lawsuits and derivative claims made on behalf of the plaintiffs.\nEconomic Conditions\nThe global economy and capital and credit markets continue to experience uncertainty and volatility. Unfavorable changes in economic conditions may result in lower freight volumes and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results, as experienced in 2009 and 2012. These conditions may adversely affect certain of the Company\u2019s customers, carriers and third party services providers. Were that to occur, the Company\u2019s revenues and net earnings could also be adversely affected. Should customers\u2019 ability to pay deteriorate, additional bad debts may be incurred.\nThese unfavorable conditions can create situations where rate increases charged by carriers and other service providers are implemented with little or no advanced notice. The Company often times cannot pass these rate increases on to its customers in the same time frame, if at all. As a result, the Company\u2019s yields and margins can be negatively impacted, as experienced in 2012 and parts of 2013 and 2014, particularly with ocean freight.\nCatastrophic Events\nA disruption or failure of the Company\u2019s systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, strike, civil unrest, pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other mission-critical functions. The Company\u2019s corporate headquarters, and certain other critical business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, which is near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of the Company\u2019s critical business or information technology systems could harm the Company\u2019s ability to conduct normal business operations and its operating results.\n| 10.", "PERMNO": 87717, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "EXPD"}
