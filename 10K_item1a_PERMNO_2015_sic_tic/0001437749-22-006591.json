RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock. Investors or potential investors in our stock should carefully consider the risks described below.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have not yet achieved annual positive cash flows.\nOur net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations was $4.2 million in 2021 and $7.9 million in 2020. We may not be able to achieve revenue growth, profitability or positive cash flow, on either a quarterly or annual basis, and that profitability, if achieved, may not be sustained. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, we may not be financially viable in the future and may have to curtail, suspend, or cease operations, restructure existing operations to attempt to ensure future viability, or pursue other alternatives such as pursuing dissolution and liquidation, seeking to merge with another company, selling all or substantially all of our assets or raising additional capital through equity or debt financings.\nWe have generated significant losses since our inception in 2000, and losses in the future could cause the trading price of our stock to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow, and ability to pay our debts as they become due.\nSince we began operations in 2000, we have incurred an accumulated deficit in excess of $307.9 million. We may not be able to achieve profitability or maintain profitable operations if achieved. If our losses continue, our liquidity may continue to be severely impaired, our stock price may fall and our shareholders may lose all or a significant portion of their investment. If we are not able to attain profitability in the near future our financial condition could deteriorate further which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of shareholder investment. Further, we may be unable to pay our debt obligations as they become due, which include obligations to secured creditors.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings in the future to achieve our business objectives and to satisfy our cash obligations, which would dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders and possibly subordinate certain of their rights to the rights of new investors.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings in order to complete our ultimate business objectives. We also may choose to raise additional funds in debt or equity financings if they are available to us on reasonable terms to increase our working capital, strengthen our financial position or to make acquisitions. Our board of directors has the ability, without seeking shareholder approval, to issue convertible debt and additional shares of common stock or preferred stock that is convertible into common stock for such consideration as the board of directors may consider sufficient, which may be at a discount to the market price. Any sales of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution of the equity interests of our existing shareholders, which could be substantial. Additionally, if we issue shares of preferred stock or convertible debt to raise funds, the holders of those securities might be entitled to various preferential rights over the holders of our common stock, including repayment of their investment, and possibly additional amounts, before any payments could be made to holders of our common stock in connection with an acquisition of us. Such preferred shares, if authorized, might be granted rights and preferences that would be senior to, or otherwise adversely affect, the rights and the value of our common stock. Also, new investors may require that we and certain of our shareholders enter into voting arrangements that give them additional voting control or representation on our board of directors. We have a limited number of authorized and unissued (and unreserved) shares, which limits our ability to raise additional funds through such debt or equity financings. Our shareholders would need to approve any increase in the number of authorized shares. In the event that we determine that such an increase is desirable, it is possible our shareholders will not approve the increase.\nOur outstanding debt is subject to terms that may adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe entered into a factoring agreement in October 2019. The factoring agreement provides for a $7.0 million credit facility which we may draw upon to the extent we have qualifying accounts receivable as defined in the agreement. The lender has the right to demand repayment of advances under the facility at any time, and amounts owed under the agreement are secured by our personal property assets. If the lender demands repayment and we fail to make such repayment, or if we cause or permit any other event of default as defined in the agreement or fail to comply with covenants set forth in the agreement (including restrictions on incurring other debt under unsecured loans), we would be subject to additional expenses or possible foreclosure on our assets that secure our obligations under the agreement. Such results could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe received $1.8 million on an SBA Payroll Protection Program (PPP) loan in April 2020 as provided for in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES), enacted into U.S. law in March 2020. The outstanding principal and related accrued interest on our PPP loan were completely forgiven in January 2021. The SBA may audit any PPP loan at its discretion through January 2027, six years after the date the SBA forgave the loan. The SBA may review any or all of the following when auditing a PPP loan: whether the borrower qualified for the PPP loan, whether the PPP loan amount was appropriately calculated and the proceeds used for allowable purposes, and whether the loan forgiveness amount was appropriately determined. We could be deemed ineligible for the PPP loan received in 2020 upon audit by the SBA. We believe the SBA\u2019s stated intention is to focus its reviews on borrowers with loans greater than $2 million, thereby mitigating our future risk of an audit. The SBA continues to develop and issue new and updated guidance regarding required borrower certifications and requirements for forgiveness of loans made under the program.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have $2.5 million outstanding on a mortgage promissory note. The note is secured by certain real property and personal property assets of Golden Ridge Rice Mills, Inc. If we fail to make repayment, we would be subject to additional expenses or possible foreclosure on the assets that secure our obligations under the agreement. Such results could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements and our Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price.\nWe are required to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting and to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the framework established by Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. If we fail to maintain effective internal controls in the future, this could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial information or cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nThere are significant market risks associated with our business.\nWe have formulated our business plan and strategies based on certain assumptions regarding the size of the rice, rice bran, barley and oat markets, our anticipated share of these markets, the estimated price and acceptance of our products and other factors. These assumptions are based on our best estimates; however, our assessments may not prove to be correct. Any future success may depend upon factors including changes in governmental regulation, increased levels of competition, including the entry of additional competitors and increased success by existing competitors, changes in general economic conditions, increases in operating costs including costs of rice bran, production, supplies, personnel, equipment, and reduced margins caused by competitive pressures. Many of these factors are beyond our control.\nWe may face difficulties integrating businesses we acquire.\nAs part of our strategy, we may review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies, such as the acquisition of Golden Ridge that was completed in 2018, and the acquisition of MGI Grain that was completed in 2019, that would complement our current products, expand the breadth of our markets or enhance technical capabilities, or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities. Such acquisitions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nproblems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated costs;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u25cf\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and\n\u25cf\npotential loss of key employees of purchased organizations.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers and their ability to meet their obligations.\nIn 2021, three customers accounted for 32% of revenues and the top ten customers accounted for 58% of revenues. As of December 31, 2021, the customers with the highest ten balances accounted for 61% of accounts receivable.\nWe are dependent upon the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues. Consolidation among our customers may reduce our number of customers or result in a concentration of credit risk with respect to outstanding accounts receivable. We consider the financial strength of our customers, the remoteness of the possible risk that a default event will occur, the potential benefits to our future growth and development, possible actions to reduce the likelihood of a default event, and the benefits from the transaction, before entering into a large credit limit with a customer. Although we analyze these factors, the ultimate collection of the obligation from the customer may not occur. Although we continue to expand our customer base in an attempt to mitigate the concentration of credit risk, writing off of an accounts receivable balance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. Historically, we have not experienced any loss of our cash and cash equivalents, but we have experienced losses to our trade receivables. A significant reduction in sales to any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may encounter difficulties in maintaining relationships with distributors and customers while enforcing our credit policies.\nWe define credit risk as the risk of loss from obligors or counterparty default. Our credit risks arise from both distributors and customers. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Our ability to forecast future trends and spot shifts in consumer patterns or behavior even before they occur are vital for success in today\u2019s economy. In managing risk, our objective is to protect our profitability, but also to protect, to the extent we can, our ongoing relationships with our distributors and customers. However, as part of our credit risk policies, we occasionally must, among other things, cancel, reduce credit limits and place cash-only requirements for certain questionable accounts. These credit risk policies may negatively impact our relationships with our distributors and customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely upon a limited number of product offerings.\nThe majority of the products that we have sold through December 31, 2021, has been based on SRB. A decline in the market demand for our SRB or the products of other companies utilizing our SRB products would have a significant adverse impact on us. Since the acquisition of Golden Ridge, we have also milled and sold finished rice. A decline in the market demand for finished rice or the by-products of rice milling could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nOur ability to generate sales is dependent upon our ability to continue our ongoing marketing efforts to raise awareness of our products and benefits of rice bran products generally.\nWe are dependent on our ability to market products to animal food producers, food manufacturers, mass merchandisers, health food retailers and to other companies for use in their products. We must increase the level of awareness and benefits of rice bran products to be used in food and food ingredients in general and our products in particular. We will be required to devote substantial management and financial resources to these marketing and advertising efforts and such efforts may not be successful.\nOur ability to adapt to sudden increases in demand for our product is limited by an adequate supply of raw rice bran and our ability to find additional facilities for production.\nMany of our current products depend on our proprietary technology using raw rice bran, which is a by-product from milling paddy rice to white rice. Our ability to manufacture SRB is currently limited to the production capability of our equipment located at our two suppliers\u2019 rice mills in California, our own plant located adjacent to our supplier in Mermentau, Louisiana and our rice mill in Wynne, Arkansas. At these facilities and our value-added product plant in Dillon, Montana, we currently are capable of producing enough finished products to meet current demand. If demand for our products were to increase dramatically in the future, we would need additional production capacity, which may take time and may expose us to additional long-term operating costs.\nWe may not be able to continue to secure adequate sources of raw rice bran to meet our future demand. Since rice bran has a limited shelf life, the supply of rice bran is affected by the amount of rice planted and harvested each year.\nAdverse economic, weather, or other conditions may impact our supply and the price of rice, raw rice bran, stabilized rice bran, barley, and oats. We are not always able to immediately pass cost increases to our customers and any increase in the cost of our rice and rice coproducts, SRB products, and oat and barley products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf economic or weather conditions, for example drought conditions in California or flooding in Arkansas and Louisiana, adversely affect the amount of rice planted or harvested, the cost of rice bran products that we use may increase. Drought or excessive moisture can have similar impacts on the timing and number of acres planted to barley and oats in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Manitoba as well. We are not always able to immediately pass cost increases to our customers. Therefore, cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face competition from other companies that produce bran, grains and other alternative ingredients with similar benefits as our rice brans.\nCompetition in our targeted industries, including food ingredients, animal feed supplements and companion pet food ingredients is vigorous, with a large number of businesses engaged in the various industries. Many of our competitors have established reputations for successfully developing and marketing their products, including products that incorporate bran from other cereal grains and other alternative ingredients that are widely recognized as providing similar benefits as rice bran. In addition, many of our competitors have greater financial, managerial and technical resources than we do. If we are not successful in competing in these markets, we may not be able to attain our business objectives.\nWe are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints both domestically and abroad and our failure to comply with these laws, regulations and constraints could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nIn both the U.S. and foreign markets, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our products are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal, state or local levels in the United States and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), state and local authorities and foreign governmental agencies. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may negatively impact the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of sales revenues. Our failure to comply with these current and new regulations could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims, limit the production or marketing of any non-compliant products or advertising and could negatively impact our business.\nOur warehousing and manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may negatively affect our business and operations.\nOur ability to make, store, and move our products is important to our success. Disruption to our manufacturing capabilities or to our storage capabilities, due to damage to our facilities or equipment, inability or delay in replacing parts or equipment, weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, or other factors, could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. If we fail to mitigate the possible impact of such events, or effectively manage them if they occur, they could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Such events could also require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nOur facilities are subject to laws and regulations administered by the FDA, USDA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, and local governmental agencies relating to the production, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. Changes in such laws or regulations that impose additional requirements on us could increase the cost of operating our facilities, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected the global economy and the ultimate impact on our business and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the business and financial markets of many countries, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility in the financial markets. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, business closures and the institution of quarantining and other restrictions on movement in communities. With widespread availability of vaccines, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has revised its guidance, travel restrictions have started to lift and businesses have reopened. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the extent to which our business and results of operations are impacted will depend on various factors beyond our control, such as duration, severity and sustained geographic resurgence of the virus, the emergence of new variants, and the success of actions to contain the virus and its variants or treat its impact. The pandemic could adversely affect the demand for our products, and it poses the risk that we, or our customers, suppliers, and other business partners may be disrupted or prevented from conducting business for an uncertain period of time. The extent to which this would impact our financial results is unknown as it is dependent on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. As such, it is difficult to estimate the exact magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nWe have not had, and we do not expect, any of our facilities to be closed subject to government-mandated closures, and we have informed our customers that we anticipate operating throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. Disruption in the supply chain of raw materials used to produce our products, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, has not caused us to close any of our facilities, and to date, our employees have been reporting to work, either remotely or in-person without any material change in attendance or productivity. However, we cannot ensure that the COVID-19 outbreak will not cause disruptions to our business in the future.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls.\nWe sell food and nutritional products for animal and human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering and other adulteration of food products. We may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. We maintain a product liability policy for $5.0 million per year in the aggregate. In addition, we may voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful, there may be negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury which could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers.\nMany of the risks of our business have only limited insurance coverage and many of our business risks are uninsurable.\nOur business operations are subject to potential product liability, environmental, fire, employee, manufacturing, shipping and other risks. Although we have insurance to cover some of these risks, the amount of this insurance is limited and includes numerous exceptions and limitations to coverage. In the event we were to suffer a significant uninsured claim, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain, enforce and protect our licenses and other intellectual property rights for our products and technology.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to protect and enforce the trade secrets and trademarks that we have and to develop and obtain new patents and trademarks for future processes, machinery, compounds and products that we develop. The process of seeking patent protection may be long and expensive, and patents might not be issued or not be broad enough in scope. We may not be able to protect our technology adequately, and our competition may be able to develop similar technology that does not infringe or encroach upon any of our rights.\nThere currently are no claims or lawsuits pending or threatened against us regarding possible infringement claims, but infringement claims by third parties, or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims, could be asserted in the future or that such assertions, if proven to be accurate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the future, litigation may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of our efforts and other resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Adverse determinations in any litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights, subjecting us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our systems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A license under a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights might not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe are dependent on key employees.\nOur success depends upon the efforts of our top management team and certain other key employees, including the efforts of our executive chairman, chief financial officer, and the other members of the senior leadership team. Although we have written employment agreements with these employees, such individuals could die, become disabled, retire, or resign. In addition, our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain key management persons for positions relating to the marketing and distribution of our products. We may not be able to recruit and employ such executives at times and on terms acceptable to us. Also, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price and changes in our overall compensation program, including our equity incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain such key employees.\nOur officers and directors have limited liability and have indemnification rights.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that we may indemnify our officers and directors against losses sustained or liabilities incurred which arise from any transaction in that officer\u2019s or director\u2019s respective managerial capacity, unless that officer or director violates a duty of loyalty, did not act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct or knowingly violated the law, approved an improper dividend or derived an improper benefit from the transaction.\nRisks Relating to Our Stock\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. The market price of the common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the cost of raw rice bran;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our relationships with customers and suppliers;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain financing;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations or new systems or enhancements used by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe loss of services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our or our competitors\u2019 intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nadverse effects to our operating results due to the impairment of goodwill;\n\u25cf\nfailure to meet the expectation of securities analysts or the public;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and market conditions;\n\u25cf\nour ability to expand our operations, domestically and internationally;\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of expenditures related to any expansion;\n\u25cf\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated changes in expectations by investors or analysts regarding our performance; and\n\u25cf\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Our stock price is volatile and in prior years we have been the target of shareholder litigation. Any shareholder litigation brought against us in the future could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nWe have significant \u201cequity overhang\u201d which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.\nAs of March 17, 2022, 51,814,425 shares of common stock were outstanding, 3,251,652 shares of common stock were issuable upon exercise of our outstanding stock options and warrants, 142,349 shares of common stock were issuable upon conversion of preferred stock and 1,906,334 shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock unit (exclusive of contingently granted restricted stock units). The possibility that substantial amounts of our common stock may be sold by investors or the perception that such sales could occur, often called \u201cequity overhang,\u201d could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities in the future. The issuance of the additional shares upon an increase in our authorized shares of common stock would significantly increase the amount of our common stock outstanding and the amount of the equity overhang.\nThe authorization and issuance of preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur Board, without further action or vote by holders of our common stock, has the right to establish the terms, preference, rights and restrictions and issue shares of preferred stock. Any series of preferred stock could be issued with terms, rights, preferences and restrictions that could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock and thereby reduce the value of our common stock. The designation and issuance of preferred stock favorable to current management or shareholders could make it more difficult to gain control of our board of directors or remove our current management and may be used to defeat hostile bids for control which might provide shareholders with premiums for their shares. We have designated and issued five series of preferred stock that no longer remain outstanding. In addition, in February 2017, we designated a seventh series of preferred stock, Series G. As of March 17, 2022, 150 shares of Series G preferred stock remain outstanding. We may issue additional series of preferred stock in the future.\nIf we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities could be delisted, which could affect the market price of our common stock and reduce our ability to raise capital.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cRIBT\u201d. For our common stock to continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we must meet the current NASDAQ Capital Market continued listing requirements, including maintaining a minimum of $2.5 million in shareholders\u2019 equity and maintaining a minimum common stock bid price of $1.00. If we were unable to meet these requirements, including, but not limited to, requirements to obtain shareholder approval of a transaction other than a public offering involving the sale or issuance equal to 20% or more of our common stock at a price that is less than the market value of our common stock, our common stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOn September 15, 2021, we received a notification letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC indicating that we failed to comply with the minimum bid price requirement for a period of 30 consecutive days. To regain compliance with this listing requirement, the closing bid price of our common stock was required to be at least $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days within 180 calendar days from the date of the notification, or by March 14, 2022. We did not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by March 14, 2022. We subsequently obtained an extension of time to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by September 12, 2022. We are committed to taking actions that would enable us to regain compliance, including, if necessary, completing a reverse split of our common stock to increase its share price above the $1.00 minimum bid price.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements for Nasdaq. If we fail to maintain compliance with any such continued listing requirement, there can also be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with any such continued listing requirement in the future or that our common stock will not be delisted from NASDAQ Capital Market in the future.\nIf our securities were to be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities could continue to trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board following any delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market, or on the Pink Sheets, as the case may be. Any such delisting of our securities could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for our securities, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets.\nGeneral Risks\nWe must comply with our contractual obligations.\nWe have numerous ongoing contractual obligations under various purchase, sale, supply, production and other agreements which govern our business operations. While we seek to comply at all times with these obligations, we may not be able to comply with the terms of all contracts during all periods of time, especially if there are significant changes in market conditions or our financial condition. If we are unable to comply with our material contractual obligations, there likely would be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with corporate governance and public disclosure regulations may result in additional expenses.\nIn order to comply with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) entitled \u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework\u201d, and other regulations issued by the SEC, such as Dodd-Frank, we may need to invest substantial resources to comply with these evolving standards, and this investment would result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nBreaches of our information system security measures could disrupt our internal operations.\nWe are dependent upon information technology for the distribution of information internally and also to our customers and suppliers. This information technology is subject to theft, damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to malicious computer viruses, security breaches and defects in design. Security breaches may result from employees\u2019 failure to observe internal control protocols designed to protect the security of our network and the information on it, or solely from external intrusion despite our best efforts to protect our network and the information on it. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information system and network disruptions, but a system failure or breach of these measures could negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nOur inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.\nShould we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquake, hurricane or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of key personnel, and the proper functioning of computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. Further, we could potentially lose customer data or experience adverse interruptions to our operations in a disaster recovery scenario, which could result in material financial loss, regulatory action, reputational harm or legal liability.", "PERMNO": 14355, "SIC": 2090, "TIC": "RIBT"}
