Risk Factors\nThis section describes material risks to our businesses that currently are known to us. You should carefully consider the risks described below. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks and factors listed below, however, are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing environment. Other known risks that we currently believe to be immaterial could become material in the future. We also are subject to legal and regulatory changes. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Restructuring and Our Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial level of indebtedness and we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and other obligations. Due to contraction in our business and constraints imposed by our asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d), coupled with substantial interest payments, there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as we are unable to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our debt obligations, including the interest payments on our 9.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (the \u201c2018 Notes\u201d) and 12.5%/10.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2021 (the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d), and operating needs. As a result, we are in default under our ABL Facility, which has caused cross-defaults under our term loan and indentures governing our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes. We plan to restructure under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d) to address our liquidity, capital structure, and debt service obligations.\nWe are highly leveraged and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs results from debt service requirements and from funding our costs of operations and capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2016, we had $487.6 million of indebtedness outstanding, consisting of $40.4 million of 2018 Notes, $351.3 million of 2021 Notes, $60.7 million under a term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), $22.7 million under our ABL Facility, $12.5 million of capital leases for vehicle financings and a note payable for the purchase of the remaining interest in AWS. As of February 28, 2017, we had approximately $7.3 million of net availability under our ABL Facility. Our interest expense, net, was approximately $54.5 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016. We have incurred operating losses from continuing operations of $167.6 million, $195.2 million and $457.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe substantial and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices has resulted in significant reductions in our customers\u2019 operating and capital expenditures. This extended downturn has resulted in reduced demand for our services as well as lower prices and operating margins, and has adversely affected our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, resulting in a decline in liquidity available to fund our operations. Recent amendments to our ABL Facility have further constrained our liquidity by reducing the maximum revolver commitments and availability thereunder through the implementation of additional reserves and availability blocks. These recent amendments have resulted in a material reduction in the amount we can borrow under the ABL Facility.\nSince March 31, 2017, we have been in default under our ABL Facility as we were unable to repay our obligations under the ABL Facility or extend or refinance the ABL Facility before maturity. As a result, the lenders under our ABL Facility are entitled to exercise their rights and remedies under the ABL Facility, the other Loan Documents (as defined under the ABL Facility), and applicable law. In addition, the default under the ABL Facility constitutes an event of cross-default under the Term Loan and indentures governing our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes. The Company does not currently have sufficient liquidity to repay the obligations under the ABL Facility, Term Loan, or indentures governing our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes. As such, the holders of the Company\u2019s indebtedness may initiate foreclosure actions at any time.\nAs we are in default under our ABL Facility, Term Loan, and indentures governing our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes, and unable to repay the obligations thereunder, the Company intends to file a prepackaged plan of reorganization (the \u201cPlan\u201d) under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company has entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the \u201cRestructuring Support Agreement\u201d) with the holders of over 80% (the \u201cSupporting Noteholders\u201d) of the Company\u2019s outstanding 2021 Notes to support a financial restructuring pursuant to chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"Restructuring\"). There can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully consummate the Plan, restructure under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, or realize all or any of the expected benefits from the Restructuring.\nWe plan to seek the protection of the Bankruptcy Court, which subjects us to the risks and uncertainties associated with chapter 11 proceedings and may harm our business and place our equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their investment in the Company.\nFor the duration of our bankruptcy proceedings, our operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan, and our ability to continue as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. As such, seeking Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as a chapter 11 case continues, our senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort attending to the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection also might make it more difficult to retain management, including Mark D. Johnsrud, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and other employees necessary to the success and growth of our business. Other significant risks include the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to prosecute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the chapter 11 proceedings;\n\u2022\nthe high costs of bankruptcy and related fees;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business plan in the current depressed commodity price environment; and\n\u2022\nthe actions and decisions of our debtholders and other third parties who have interests in our chapter 11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nDelays in our chapter 11 proceedings increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nOur Restructuring Support Agreement contemplates the confirmation of the Plan through an orderly prepackaged plan of reorganization, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement such a Plan. In order for any proposed plan of reorganization to be confirmed, the Bankruptcy Code, in addition to other legal requirements, requires that at least one impaired class of creditors votes to accept the plan of reorganization. In order for a class to approve a plan of reorganization, approval of over one-half in number of creditors and at least two-thirds in claim amount by those who vote in each impaired class of creditors are required. In addition to obtaining the required votes, the requirements for a Bankruptcy Court to approve a plan of reorganization include, among other judicial findings, that:\n\u2022\nwe acted in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code; and\n\u2022\nthe plan of reorganization has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.\nIn the event at least one class of impaired creditors or interest holders that do not vote to accept the plan of reorganization, we would have to satisfy the \u2018\u2018cram down\u2019\u2019 requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and show that the plan of reorganization does not unfairly discriminate and is fair and equitable with respect to those classes of claims and interests that did not vote to accept the plan of reorganization.\nWe may not be able to obtain approval of a disclosure statement and/or the required votes or the required judicial approval to the proposed plan of reorganization promptly, if at all. In such event, a prolonged chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding could adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees, among other parties, which in turn could adversely affect our business, competitive position, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern. A weakening of our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could adversely affect our ability to implement our proposed Plan. In addition, if the Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, we may be forced to liquidate our assets.\nOnce our bankruptcy proceeding is commenced, it is also possible that the Bankruptcy Court may dismiss the proceeding or otherwise decide to abstain from hearing it on procedural grounds. In addition, the confirmation and effectiveness of our Plan is subject to certain conditions and requirements in addition to those described above that may not be satisfied, and the Bankruptcy Court may conclude that the requirements for confirmation and effectiveness have not been satisfied.\nAdditionally, we have a significant amount of secured indebtedness that is senior to our unsecured indebtedness and a significant amount of total indebtedness that is senior to our existing common stock in our capital structure. The Plan contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement provides for a limited recovery for unsecured noteholders and potentially no recovery to equity holders. If the Plan is confirmed, equity holders are at significant risk of losing all of their investment in our Company. Further, there can be no assurances as to the value of any recoveries to our secured creditors.\nThe Restructuring Support Agreement is subject to significant conditions and milestones that may be difficult for us to satisfy.\nThere are certain material conditions we must satisfy under the Restructuring Support Agreement, including the timely satisfaction of milestones in the chapter 11 proceedings, such as meeting specified milestones related to the solicitation of votes to approve the Plan, commencement of the chapter 11 cases, confirmation of the Plan, consummation of the Plan, and the entry of orders relating to the debtor-in-possession credit facilities. Our ability to timely complete such milestones is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control.\nThe Restructuring Support Agreement is subject to significant conditions and milestones that may be beyond our control and may be difficult for us to satisfy. If the Restructuring Support Agreement is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Restructuring Support Agreement contains a number of termination events, the occurrence of which gives each Supporting Noteholder the right to terminate the Restructuring Support Agreement solely with respect to such Supporting Noteholder. Such termination may result in the loss of support for the Plan by the parties to the Restructuring Support Agreement, which could adversely affect our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan. If the Plan is not consummated, there can be no assurance that we would be able to enter into a new plan or that any new plan would be as favorable to holders of claims as the Plan. In\naddition, our chapter 11 proceedings could become protracted, which could significantly and detrimentally impact our relationships with vendors, suppliers, employees, and customers\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of the Plan.\nThere can be no assurance that the Plan as outlined in the Restructuring Support Agreement (or any other plan of reorganization) will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court. As a result, investors should exercise caution with respect to existing and future investments in our securities. The success of any reorganization will depend on approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the willingness of existing debt and security holders to agree to the exchange or modification of their interests as outlined in the Plan, and there can be no guarantee of success with respect to the Plan or any other plan of reorganization. For instance, we might receive objections to confirmation of the Plan from various stakeholders in the chapter 11 cases. We cannot predict the impact that any objection might have on the Plan or on a Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision to confirm the Plan. Any objection may cause us to devote significant resources in response which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if any, distributions holders of claims against us, including holders of our secured and unsecured debt and equity, would ultimately receive with respect to their claims. As a result, we believe that implementation of any plan is likely to result in a limited recovery for noteholders, and place equity holders at significant risk of losing most or all of their interests in our company.\nThere can be no assurance as to whether we will successfully reorganize and emerge from the chapter 11 cases or, if we do successfully reorganize, as to when we would emerge from the chapter 11 cases. If we are unable to successfully reorganize, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nWe may not have adequate liquidity to operate our business.\nWe have historically relied on cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities and borrowings available under our ABL Facility and Term Loan for our liquidity needs. As we are in default under our ABL Facility, the commitments under the ABL Facility have terminated and the lenders under the ABL Facility have no obligation to provide additional loans or otherwise extend credit under the ABL Facility. In connection with entering into the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Supporting Noteholders agreed to provide interim financing to the Company in the amount of $9.1 million prior to the commencement of the chapter 11 cases. In addition, the Restructuring Support Agreement provides that we will receive debtor-in-possession financing, proceeds from the $150.0 million rights offering, and, if needed, exit financing. While we anticipate having sufficient liquidity from these transactions to fund our operations and consummate the Restructuring, there can be no assurances to that effect. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain sufficient liquidity or access other sources of liquidity when needed in the future.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur capital structure will likely be significantly altered under the Plan or any other plan of reorganization ultimately confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start reporting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit would be restated to zero. Accordingly, if fresh-start reporting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our board of directors will change significantly.\nUnder the Plan, the composition of our board of directors will change significantly. The Restructuring Support Agreement contemplates upon emergence, the board of directors will be comprised of five directors. The Supporting Noteholders will designate four members in the aggregate, and the remaining director will be the chief executive officer of the reorganized Company. Accordingly, four of our five directors are expected to be new to the Company. The new directors are likely to have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on our board of directors\nand, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nThe pursuit of the chapter 11 cases has consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may face increased levels of employee attrition.\nLeading up to and following commencement of the chapter 11 cases contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement, our management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the cases. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the chapter 11 cases are protracted. During the pendency of the chapter 11 cases, our employees will face considerable distraction and uncertainty and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet customer expectations, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. The failure to retain or attract members of our management team, including Mark D. Johnsrud, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and other key personnel could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Likewise, we could experience losses of customers who may be concerned about our ongoing long-term viability.\nIn certain instances, a chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nFollowing the commencement of our chapter 11 cases, upon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our chapter 11 case to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in our Plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nTransfers of our equity, or issuances of equity before or in connection with our chapter 11 proceedings, may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards in future years.\nUnder federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses carried forward from prior years. We have net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $316.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and amortizable tax basis in our properties may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an \u201cownership change\u201d if one or more stockholders owning 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period. Under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, absent an applicable exception, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the amount of its net operating losses that may be utilized to offset future taxable income generally is subject to an annual limitation. Further, future deductions for depreciation, depletion and amortization could be limited if the fair value of our assets is determined to be less than the tax basis. In April 2016, we undertook certain restructuring transactions that resulted in an ownership change. As a result of the implementation of a plan of reorganization or following such implementation, it is possible that another \u201cownership change\u201d may be deemed to occur.\nThe terms of the debtor-in-possession financing and exit financing, if any, may restrict our future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions.\nThe terms of the debtor-in-possession financing and exit financing may contain, and the terms of any of other future indebtedness would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose certain operating and other restrictions.\nSuch financing may include covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nrepurchase our indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nmake other restricted payments and investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in those agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.\nSince March 31, 2017, we have been in default under our ABL Facility as we were unable to repay our obligations under the ABL Facility or extend or refinance the ABL Facility before maturity. The default under the ABL Facility constitutes an event of cross-default under the Term Loan and indentures governing our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes. Such default under our debt agreements could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. The acceleration of all of our indebtedness would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement the Plan and finance and continue our operations.\nSince March 31, 2017, we have been in default under our ABL Facility as we were unable to repay our obligations under the ABL Facility or extend or refinance the ABL Facility before maturity. As a result, the lenders under our ABL Facility are entitled to exercise their rights and remedies under the ABL Facility, the other Loan Documents (as defined under the ABL Facility), and applicable law. In addition, the default under the ABL Facility constitutes an event of cross-default under the Term Loan and indentures governing our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes. The Company does not currently have sufficient liquidity to repay the obligations under the ABL Facility, Term Loan, or indentures governing our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes. As such, the holders of the Company\u2019s indebtedness may initiate foreclosure actions at any time; however, holders of over 80% in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Company\u2019s 2021 Notes have agreed to provide the Company interim financing prior to the filing of the Plan and support the Company\u2019s Restructuring under the Restructuring Support Agreement.\nIf the debt under our ABL Facility, Term Loan, or Indentures were to be accelerated as a result of the continuing events of default, we currently do not have sufficient liquidity to repay these borrowings and we may not have sufficient liquidity to do so in the future. In such an event, there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain alternative financing to enable us to repay our indebtedness or, if we were able to obtain such financing, there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us. As a result, our ability to finance and continue our operations could be materially and adversely affected and we may not be able to implement the Plan and consummate an orderly prepackaged restructuring pursuant to chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nWe may not make interest payments in respect of our 2018 and 2021 Notes.\nBoth our 2018 and 2021 Notes have an interest payment due on April 17, 2017. We currently do not have the liquidity to make those payments when due. The indentures governing the 2018 Notes and the 2021 Notes provide for a 30 day grace period prior to the exercise of remedies by holders for defaults related to missed interest payments. The Restructuring Support Agreement contemplates that we will file chapter 11 cases prior to the expiration of that grace period. Even if we do not file the chapter 11 cases in the timeframe contemplated, it is still possible that the next interest payments on the 2018 and 2021 Notes will not be made prior to the expiration of the grace period.\nOur ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness depends in part on our earnings and cash flows and those of our subsidiaries and on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to us.\nWe conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Consequently, our ability to service our debt is dependent, in large part, upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to us, whether by dividends, loans, advances or other payments. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us depends on their earnings, capital requirements and general financial conditions\nand is restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate and other laws and regulations as well as, in the future, agreements to which our subsidiaries may be a party.\nOur borrowings under future credit facilities will expose us to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings will likely be exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under future credit facilities. Any future credit facility will likely carry a floating interest rate; therefore, as interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe are currently operating at a loss and have substantial debt and declining liquidity to cover our operations, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs. Absent successfully consummating the Restructuring on acceptable terms before our available cash necessary to sustain our ongoing operations is depleted, we may not be able to continue operations .\nAs reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and a net loss for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. These factors, coupled with our large outstanding debt balance, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs. We are attempting to generate sufficient revenue and reduce costs; however, our cash position may not be sufficient enough to support our daily operations beyond April 2017. While we are in the process of implementing the Restructuring aimed at recapitalizing the Company to address our liquidity, capital structure, and debt service obligations, there can be no assurances that the Restructuring will be successful. (See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - \u201cSubsequent Events Related to Indebtedness and Restructuring Plan\".) Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent upon our ability to restructure our debt to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and operating needs. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or future borrowings or that our Restructuring will be successful.\nWe currently do not have enough liquidity, including cash on hand, to service our debt obligations and to fund day-to-day operations through fiscal 2017. As such, we will be dependent on the financing provided for in the Restructuring Support Agreement in order to fund continuing operations, which may not be available to us if the Restructuring Support Agreement terminates or we are unable to successfully consummate the Restructuring. There can be no assurances that the Supporting Noteholders will extend additional borrowings to us, or, if so, on what terms. Without the implementation of the Plan and consummation of the Restructuring, our existing cash and other sources of liquidity may only be sufficient to fund our operations (excluding debt payments) through April 2017. If we do not consummate the Restructuring on acceptable terms before our available cash necessary to sustain our ongoing operations is depleted, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nOur business depends on spending by our customers in the oil and natural gas industry in the United States, and this spending and our business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by industry and financial market conditions that are beyond our control. The substantial and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices has resulted in lower expenditures by our customers, which have had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the continuation of such decline could further materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. These expenditures are generally dependent on current oil and natural gas prices and the industry\u2019s view of future oil and natural gas prices, including the industry\u2019s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. The substantial and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices has resulted in significant reductions in our customers\u2019 operating and capital expenditures, which has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The continuation or extension of such declines in these expenditures could result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, delays in, or nonpayment of, amounts owed to us, increased exposure to credit risk and bad debts, and a general reduction in demand for our services. These effects could have a further material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIndustry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and worldwide price and supply of gas, natural gas liquids and oil, including the natural gas inventories and oil reserves of the United States;\n\u2022\nchanges in the level of consumer demand;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and processing facilities;\n\u2022\nthe level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including by commodity price speculators and others;\n\u2022\nthe nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nactions of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or \"OPEC,\" relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe level of excess production and projected rates of production growth;\n\u2022\ngeo-political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions; and\n\u2022\noverall domestic and global economic and market conditions.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is currently experiencing a prolonged downturn due to a global oversupply of crude oil and natural gas, resulting in dramatic declines in oil and natural gas prices. Since the second half of 2014 and throughout both 2015 and 2016, oil prices have remained substantially below historic highs and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. The current downturn in the industry has resulted in diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices customers are willing to pay for services such as ours. A continuation of the downturn in the oil and natural gas industry could result in a further reduction in demand for oilfield services as well as lower prices and operating margins, and could have a further material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the past, we have experienced periods of low demand and have incurred operating losses. In the future, we may not be able to achieve or maintain our profitability due to an inability to reduce costs, increase revenue, or reduce our debt obligations. Under such circumstances, we may incur further operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow.\nOur operating margins and profitability may be negatively impacted by changes in fuel and energy costs. In addition, due to certain fixed costs, our operating margins and earnings may be sensitive to changes in revenues.\nOur business is dependent on availability of fuel for operating our fleet of trucks. Changes and volatility in the price of crude oil can adversely impact the prices for these products and therefore affect our operating results. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events beyond our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and natural gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and natural gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns, and environmental concerns.\nFurthermore, our facilities, fleet and personnel subject us to fixed costs, which make our margins and earnings sensitive to changes in revenues. In periods of declining demand, we may be unable to cut costs at a rate sufficient to offset revenue declines, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage to firms with lower or more flexible cost structures, and may result in reduced operating margins and/or higher operating losses. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture charges due to possible impairments of assets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price.\nAs discussed more fully in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year ended December 31, 2016 we recorded total impairment charges for long-lived assets of $42.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $104.7 million. As of December 31, 2015, there is no remaining goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015 we recorded an impairment charge of $5.9 million related to some of the remaining assets in the MidCon basin which we exited in fiscal 2015. If there is further deterioration in our business operations or prospects, our stock price, the broader economy or our industry, including further declines in oil and natural gas prices, the value of our long-lived assets, or those we may acquire in the future, could decrease significantly and result in additional impairment and financial statement write-offs.\nThe testing of long-lived assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the composition of our reporting units; changes in economic, industry or market conditions; changes in business operations; changes in competition; or potential changes in the share price of our common stock and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or differences in our actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance, could affect the fair value of long-lived assets, which may result in further impairment charges. We perform the assessment of potential impairment at least annually, or more often if events and circumstances require.\nShould the value of our long-lived assets become impaired, we would incur additional charges which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could result in us incurring additional net operating losses in future periods. We cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets. Any future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of long-lived assets, although not requiring any additional cash outlay, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price.\nWe depend on the continued service of Mark D. Johnsrud, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and other senior management.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our people and, in particular, the continued services of Mr. Johnsrud, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. We currently have no Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Johnsrud is serving as our Principal Financial Officer. We depend on our finance and accounting team and outside consultants to guide corporate accounting and financial reporting, financial planning, and treasury management. Members of our senior management team, including Mr. Johnsrud, may resign at any time. The loss of the services of Mr. Johnsrud, or of other members of our senior management, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline, or by current or potential providers of debt financing, which may make it more difficult or costly to refinance outstanding indebtedness or incur new or additional indebtedness. We do not carry key-person life insurance on any of our senior management.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mark D. Johnsrud, owns a significant amount of our voting stock and may have interests that differ from other shareholders. Mr. Johnsrud, as a significant shareholder, may, therefore, take actions that are not in the interest of other shareholders.\nMark D. Johnsrud, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, owns shares representing approximately 85% of our common stock as of December 31, 2016, and, therefore, he has significant control on the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, including, but not limited to, electing directors, adopting amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approving corporate transactions. In addition, due to Mr. Johnsrud's ownership percentage, he may approve certain matters requiring shareholder approval by written consent without soliciting the votes of other shareholders. Further, Mr. Johnsrud, as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, has the power to exert significant influence over our corporate management and policies. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of Mr. Johnsrud, as a significant shareholder, could be in conflict with the interests of other shareholders, and Mr. Johnsrud would have significant influence to cause us to take actions that align with his interests. Should conflicts of interest arise, we can provide no assurance that Mr. Johnsrud would act in the best interests of our other shareholders or that any conflicts of interest would be resolved in a manner favorable to our other shareholders.\nThe litigation environment in which we operate poses a significant risk to our businesses.\nWe are often involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, and environmental issues, other claims for injuries and damages, and various shareholder and class action litigation, among other matters. We may experience negative outcomes in such lawsuits in the future. Any such negative outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from such assessments and estimates. The settlement or resolution of such claims or proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, judges and juries in certain jurisdictions in which we conduct business have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage and other tort cases. We use appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against us, but the litigation environment in these areas poses a significant business risk to us and could cause a significant diversion of management's time and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe hazards and risks associated with the transport, storage, and handling, treatment and disposal of our customers\u2019 waste (such as fires, spills, explosions and accidents) may expose us to personal injury claims, property damage claims and/or products liability claims from our employees, customers or third parties. As protection against such claims and operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses. However, we may sustain losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks, or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. As more fully described in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements herein, due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits, and we may be held liable for significant personal injury or damage to property or third parties, or other losses, that are not fully covered by our insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant capital expenditures are required to conduct our business, and our failure or inability to make sufficient capital investments could significantly harm our business prospects.\nThe development of our business and services, excluding acquisition activities, requires capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we made capital expenditures of approximately $3.8 million, which primarily related to expenditures to extend the useful life and productivity on our fleet of trucks, tanks, equipment and disposal wells. We continue to focus on finding ways to improve the utilization of our existing assets and optimizing the allocation of resources in the various shale areas in which we operate. Our capital expenditure program is subject to market conditions, including customer activity levels, commodity prices, industry capacity and specific customer needs. In addition to capital expenditures required to maintain our current level of business activity, we may incur capital expenditures to support future growth of our business.\nWe expect capital spending levels in 2017 to increase to approximately $10.0 million if we are able to obtain financing for capital expenditures following our Restructuring. Prolonged reductions or delays in capital expenditures could delay or diminish future cash flows and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our planned capital expenditures for 2017 are expected to be financed through cash flow from operations, borrowings under new credit facilities if available, issuances of debt or equity, capital leases, alternative financing structures, or a combination of the foregoing. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of drilling activity and oil and natural gas production of our customers, prices of natural gas and oil, and the other risk factors discussed herein. Our ability to obtain capital from other sources, such as the capital markets, is dependent upon many of those same factors as well as the orderly functioning of credit and capital markets. To the extent we fail to have adequate funds, we could be required to further reduce or defer our capital spending, or pursue other funding alternatives which may not be as economically attractive to us, which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions, and we may find it necessary to increase driver compensation and/or modify the benefits provided to our employees in future periods.\nWe employed approximately 385 truck drivers as of December 31, 2016. Maintaining a staff of qualified truck drivers is critical to the success of our operations. We and other companies in the oil and natural gas industry suffer from a high turnover rate of drivers. The high turnover rate requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of drivers in order to operate existing equipment. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers, we could be forced to, among other things, increase driver compensation and/or modify our benefit packages, or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. Additionally, in anticipation of or in response to geographical and market-related fluctuations in the demand for our services, we strategically relocate our equipment and personnel from one area to another, which may result in operating inefficiencies, increased labor, fuel and other operating costs and could adversely affect our growth and profitability. As a result, our driver and employee training and orientation costs could be negatively impacted. We also utilize the services of independent contractor truck drivers to supplement our trucking capacity in certain shale areas on an as-needed basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into these types of arrangements on favorable terms, or that there will be sufficient qualified independent contractors available to meet our needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of any of these key customers or the loss of any contracted volumes could result in a decline in our business.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. Our three largest customers represented 12%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and in total equaled 19% of our consolidated accounts receivable at December 31, 2016. The loss of all, or even a portion, of the revenues from these customers, as a result of competition, market conditions or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. A reduction in exploration, development and production\nactivities by key customers due to the current declines in oil and natural gas prices, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCustomer payment delays of outstanding receivables could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe often provide credit to our customers for our services, and are therefore subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay outstanding invoices. In weak economic environments, customers\u2019 delays and failures to pay often increase due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their access to credit markets. If our customers delay or fail to pay a significant amount of outstanding receivables, it could reduce our availability under our revolving credit facility or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to achieve or maintain pricing to our customers at a level sufficient to cover our costs, which would negatively impact our profitability.\nWe may be unable to charge prices to our customers that are sufficient to cover our costs. Our pricing is subject to highly competitive market conditions, and we may be unable to increase or maintain pricing as market conditions change. Likewise, customers may seek pricing declines more precipitously than our ability to reduce costs. In certain cases, we have entered into fixed price agreements with our customers, which may further limit our ability to raise the prices we charge our customers at a rate sufficient to offset any increases in our costs. Additionally, some customers\u2019 obligations under their agreements with us may be permanently or temporarily reduced upon the occurrence of certain events, some of which are beyond our control, including force majeure events. Force majeure events may include (but are not limited to) events such as revolutions, wars, acts of enemies, embargoes, import or export restrictions, strikes, lockouts, fires, storms, floods, acts of God, explosions, mechanical or physical failures of our equipment or facilities of our customers. If the amounts we are able to charge customers are insufficient to cover our costs, or if any customer suspends, terminates or curtails its business relationship with us, the effects could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and there can be no certainty that we will maintain our current customers or attract new customers or that our operating margins will not be impacted by competition.\nThe industries in which our business operates are highly competitive. We compete with numerous local and regional companies of varying sizes and financial resources. Competition has intensified during this downturn, and could further intensify in the future. Furthermore, numerous well-established companies are focusing significant resources on providing similar services to those that we provide that will compete with our services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively compete with these other companies or that competitive pressures, including possible downward pressure on the prices we charge for our products and services, or customer perception of our contemplated chapter 11 filing, will not arise. In addition, the current declines in oil and natural gas prices may result in competitors moving resources from higher-cost exploration and production areas to relatively lower-cost exploration and production areas where we are located thereby increasing supply and putting further downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our products and services, including our rental business. In the event that we cannot effectively compete on a continuing basis, or competitive pressures arise, such inability to compete or competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny interruption in our services due to pipeline ruptures or spills or necessary maintenance could impair our financial performance and negatively affect our brand.\nOur water transport pipelines are susceptible to ruptures and spills, particularly during start up and initial operation, and require ongoing inspection and maintenance. We may experience difficulties in maintaining the operation of our pipelines, which may cause downtime and delays. We also may be required to periodically shut down all or part of our pipelines for regulatory compliance and inspection purposes. Any interruption in our services due to pipeline breakdowns or necessary maintenance, inspection or regulatory compliance could reduce revenues and earnings and result in remediation costs. Transportation interruptions at our pipelines, even if only temporary, could severely harm our business and reputation, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, some of which are beyond our control. These risks may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards, including accidents or equipment failures that can cause pollution and other damage to the environment. Pursuant to applicable law, we may be required to remediate the environmental impact of any such accidents or incidents, which may include costs related to site investigation and soil, groundwater and surface water cleanup. In\naddition, hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, explosions, pollution and other damage to the environment, fires and hydrocarbon spills, may delay or halt operations at extraction sites which we service. These conditions can cause:\n\u2022\npersonal injury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nliabilities from pipeline breaks and accidents by our fleet of trucks and other equipment;\n\u2022\ndamage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment; and\n\u2022\nthe suspension of operations.\nThe occurrence of a significant event or a series of events that together are significant, or adverse claims in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that are not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.\nWe maintain insurance coverage that we believe to be customary in the industry against these hazards. We may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, the coverage provided by such insurance may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could make such insurance prohibitively expensive. It is also possible that, when we renew our insurance coverages, our premiums and deductibles will be higher, and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or considerably more expensive, than it has been in the past. In addition, our insurance is subject to coverage limits, and some policies exclude coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination.\nImprovements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies or our customers' operating methodologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies (such as wind, solar, geothermal, fuel cells and biofuels) that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, technological changes in our customers' operating methods could decrease the need for management of water and other wellsite environmental services or otherwise affect demand for our services.\nSeasonal weather conditions and natural disasters could severely disrupt normal operations and harm our business.\nAreas in which we operate are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, our customers may curtail their operations or we may be unable to move our trucks between locations or provide other services, thereby reducing demand for, or our ability to provide services and generate revenues. For example, many municipalities impose weight restrictions on the roads that lead to our customers\u2019 job sites in the spring due to the muddy conditions caused by spring thaws, limiting our access and our ability to provide service in these areas. In addition, the regions in which we operate have in the past been, and may in the future be, affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes, windstorms, floods and tornadoes. In certain areas, our business may be dependent on our customers\u2019 ability to access sufficient water supplies to support their hydraulic fracturing operations. To the extent severe drought conditions or other factors prevent our customers from accessing adequate water supplies, our business could be negatively impacted. Future natural disasters or inclement weather conditions could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business, or our customers\u2019 business, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial and operating performance may be affected by the inability to renew landfill operating permits, obtain new landfills and expand existing ones.\nWe currently own one landfill and our ability to meet our financial and operating objectives may depend, in part, on our ability to acquire, lease, or renew landfill operating permits, expand existing landfills and develop new landfill sites. It has become increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain required permits and approvals to build, operate and expand solid waste management facilities, including landfills. Operating permits for landfills in states where we operate must generally be renewed every five to ten years, although some permits are required to be renewed more frequently. These operating permits often must be renewed several times during the permitted life of a landfill. The permit and approval process is often time consuming, requires numerous hearings and compliance with zoning, environmental and other requirements, is frequently challenged by special interest and other groups, and may result in the denial of a permit or renewal, the award of a permit or renewal for a shorter duration than we believed was otherwise required by law, or burdensome terms and conditions being imposed on our operations. We may not be able to obtain new landfill sites or expand the permitted capacity of our landfills when necessary. In\naddition, we may be unable to make the contingent consideration payment required upon the issuance of a second special waste disposal permit to expand the current landfill. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is possible any restructuring transactions could result in material additional limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving shareholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of the company\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change. In April 2016, we undertook certain restructuring transactions that resulted in an ownership change. In addition, the execution of any future restructuring transactions or other future transactions in our shares could result in an additional ownership change which could in turn reduce our ability to offset our taxable income with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire and therefore may cause us to incur a larger federal income tax liability.\nWe are self-insured against many potential liabilities, and our reserves may not be sufficient to cover future claims.\nWe maintain high deductible or self-insured retention insurance policies for certain exposures including automobile, workers\u2019 compensation and certain employee group health insurance plans. We carry policies for certain types of claims to provide excess coverage beyond the underlying policies and per incident deductibles or self-insured retentions. Because many claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies, we are effectively self-insured for a substantial portion of our claims. Our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors, which have a limited history, and by published industry development factors. The estimates inherent in these accruals are determined using actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry. If our insurance claims increase or if costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, should there be a loss or adverse judgment or other decision in an area for which we are self-insured, then our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nWe evaluate our insurance accruals, and the underlying assumptions, regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed. While we believe that the recorded amounts are reasonable, there can be no assurance that changes to our estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process. Changes in our assumptions and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, operating margins, revenues and competitive position. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA failure in our operational systems, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our business.\nOur business is dependent upon our operational and technological systems to process a large amount of data. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to\nfail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee tampering or manipulation of those systems could result in losses that are difficult to detect. We are heavily reliant on technology for communications, financial reporting, treasury management and many other important aspects of our business. Any failure in our operational systems could have a material adverse impact on our business. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational failures. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, including the ability to close our financial ledgers and report the results of our operations publicly on a timely basis or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Related To Our Common Stock\nTrading in our securities is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. We expect that the existing common stock of the Company will be extinguished under the Plan and the common stock of the reorganized company issued to holders of our 2018 Notes, 2021 Notes, and, potentially, existing holders of equity interests may not have any value.\nThe Plan, as outlined in the Restructuring Support Agreement, provides that the holders of our outstanding 2018 Notes, and 2021 Notes will receive equity of the reorganized company Holders of 2021 Notes, and, subject to certain elections by the Company and the Supporting Noteholders, holders of 2018 Notes and possibly existing equity may also receive rights to purchase common stock of the newly reorganized company in a rights offering. The Plan provides that all equity interests of existing equity holders will be extinguished. Even if the Plan is confirmed as currently outlined, the value of any securities or rights that are issued is highly speculative and the exercise prices of such rights are based upon assumed equity values that may never be attained.\nWe were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, and there is a limited trading volume for our common stock on the OTCQB.\nIn January 2016, our common stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (or \u201cNYSE\u201d). Our common stock currently trades on the OTCQB U.S. Market (the \u201cOTCQB\u201d) under the symbol NESC, and there is a limited trading volume for our common stock. As a result, relatively small trades of our common stock may have a significant impact on the price of our common stock and, therefore, may contribute to the price volatility of our common stock. Because of limited trading volume in our common stock and the price volatility of our common stock, you may be unable to sell your shares of common stock when you desire or at the price you desire. The inability to sell your shares in a declining market because of such illiquidity or at a price you desire may substantially increase your risk of loss.\nThe delisting of our common stock from the NYSE may have an adverse affect on institutional investor interest in holding or acquiring our common stock and otherwise reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock. This could negatively affect our ability to raise capital necessary to maintain operations and service our debt or effect any contemplated strategic alternatives to restructure our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, the delisting of our common stock from the NYSE may cause a loss of confidence among our employees and customers and otherwise negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe do not currently meet the listing standards of the NYSE or any other national securities exchange. We presently anticipate that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQB. As a result of the limited trading volume for our common stock, investors may be unable to sell shares of common stock at the times or in the quantities desired and, therefore, may be required to hold some or all of their shares for an indefinite period of time.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results and changes in our liquidity position;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance;\n\u2022\ninaccurate or negative comments about us on social networking websites or other media channels;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new products or product enhancements, as well as our or our competitors\u2019 success or failure in successfully executing such matters;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us of strategic plans to restructure our indebtedness or of a bankruptcy filing;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nloss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nThere is no assurance that an active public trading market will continue, or that there will be an active public trading market for the newly issued common stock of the reorganized company.\nThere can be no assurance that an active public trading market for our common stock will be sustained, or that there will be an active public trading market for the newly issued common stock of the reorganized company. If for any reason an active public trading market does not continue, or there is no active public trading market for the newly issued common stock of the reorganized company, purchasers of the shares of our common stock may have difficulty in selling their securities should they desire to do so and the price of our common stock may decline.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares of common stock could rely in part on the research and reporting that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales by us or our existing shareholders could depress the market price of our common stock.\nIf we or our existing shareholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Further, even the perception in the public market that we or our existing shareholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of the common stock.\nThe exercise of our warrants may result in substantial dilution and may depress the market price of our common stock\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding 150.9 million shares of common stock and also (i) 0.6 million shares of our common stock issuable under employee benefit plans, (ii) the Exchange Warrants exercisable for 16.5 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to $0.01 per share, and (iii) the First Lien Term Loan (or \"FLTL\") Warrants exercisable for 8.8 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. If the shares issuable under employee stock purchase plans are issued or the Warrants are exercised and the shares of common stock are issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans or upon such exercise are sold, our common shareholders may experience substantial dilution and the market price of our shares of common stock could decline. Further, the perception that such securities might be exercised could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock. In addition, holders of the Warrants are likely to exercise them when, in all likelihood, we could obtain additional capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided by the Warrants. Further, during the time that the foregoing securities are outstanding, they may adversely affect the terms on which we could obtain additional capital. We have filed a resale registration statement to facilitate the resale of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, and any such resale could reduce the market trading price of our common stock.\nWe may issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the future and shareholders may be adversely affected by the issuance of those shares.\nWe may raise additional capital or refinance or restructure our existing debt by issuing shares of common stock, or other securities convertible into common stock, which will increase the number of shares of common stock outstanding and may result in substantial dilution in the equity interest of our current shareholders and may adversely affect the market price of our\ncommon stock. We have previously issued 1.8 million shares of our common stock under a shelf registration statement and pursuant to private placement exemptions from Securities Act registration requirements, and may do so in connection with refinancing or restructuring our existing debt, financings, acquisitions, the settlement of litigation and other strategic transactions in the future. The issuance, and the resale or potential resale, of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could be dilutive to our shareholders.\nThe completion of certain of our restructuring transactions in 2016, including the conversion of Mr. Johnsrud\u2019s 2018 Notes to equity and backstop of the terminated Rights Offering, resulted in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and significant concentration of our voting stock being held by Mr. Johnsrud. Future refinancing or restructuring transactions may result in further dilution to our existing shareholders.\nThe conversion of Mr. Johnsrud\u2019s 2018 Notes to equity and backstop of the previously contemplated Rights Offering pursuant to certain restructuring transactions during 2016 resulted in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. As part of the exchange offer for our 2018 Notes, we converted approximately $31.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes for our common stock at a conversion price per share of $0.32 (the \u201cConversion Price\u201d) which were held by an entity controlled by Mr. Mark D. Johnsrud, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. Mr. Johnsrud received approximately 98.3 million shares for the conversion of his 2018 Notes. In addition, as part of our debt restructuring plan, Mr. Johnsrud agreed to backstop the previously contemplated Rights Offering for $5.0 million of common stock in exchange for a 5% backstop fee. As a result of our ongoing restructuring discussions with creditors and the potential that any bankruptcy filing could substantially reduce the value of, or even completely eliminate, shares purchased in the Rights Offering, we elected not to proceed with the Rights Offering and, as a result, on November 15, 2016, we released the 20.3 million shares that were being held in escrow to Mr. Johnsrud. The 20.3 million shares of common stock to Mr. Johnsrud includes the backstop fee of approximately 0.8 million shares of common stock and 19.5 million shares of common stock underlying the subscription rights to be distributed in the Rights Offering. Our shareholders have suffered substantial dilution in their percentage ownership as a result of the conversion of Mr. Johnsrud\u2019s 2018 Notes to equity and the 20.3 million shares issued to him in connection with our election not to consummate the planned equity Rights Offering by November 15, 2016. Mr. Johnsrud currently owns approximately 85% of our issued and outstanding common stock.\nFuture refinancing or restructuring transactions may result in further dilution to our existing shareholders. We may issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock in future refinancing or restructuring transactions and shareholders may suffer further dilution as a result.\nWe currently do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock, and restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements may prohibit us from paying dividends now or in the future. While we may declare dividends at some point in the future, subject to compliance with such restrictions and covenants, we cannot assure you that you will ever receive cash dividends as a result of ownership of our common stock and any gains from investment in our common stock may only come from increases in the market price of our common stock, if any.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover effects of certain charter and bylaw provisions and Delaware law, as well as of our substantial insider ownership.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended and restated, and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management and board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by shareholders;\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors, so that only approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022\nproviding our board of directors with the ability to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on the board of directors occurring between shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may only be removed for \u201ccause\u201d and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock; and\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings.\nWe are also subject to provisions of the Delaware corporation law that, in general, prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years following the date the beneficial owner acquired at least 15% of our stock, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors. Together, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures, as well as the significant percentage of common stock beneficially owned by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Johnsrud, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Other Governmental Regulation\nWe are subject to United States federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health, safety, transportation, and protection of natural resources and the environment. Under these laws and regulations, we may become liable for significant penalties, damages or costs of remediation. Any changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs of doing business.\nOur operations, and those of our customers, are subject to United States federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health, safety, transportation and protection of natural resources and the environment and worker safety, including those relating to waste management and transportation and disposal of produced water and other materials. For example, we are subject to environmental regulation relating to disposal into injection wells, which can pose some risks of environmental liability, including leakage from the wells to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Liability under these laws and regulations could result in cancellation of well operations, fines and penalties, expenditures for remediation, and liability for property damage and personal injuries. In addition, federal, state and local laws and regulations may be passed which would have the effect of increasing costs to our customers and possibly decreasing demand for our services. For example, if new laws and regulations are passed requiring increased safety measures for rail transport of crude oil, such laws and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for customers to transport their product, which could decrease our customers\u2019 demand for our services and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, many of our customers have intrastate pipeline operations that are subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which they are located. If new laws and/or regulations that further regulate intrastate pipelines are adopted in response to equipment failures, spills, negative environmental effects, or public sentiment, our customers may face increased costs of compliance, and thus reduce demand for our services\nOur business involves the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Accordingly, we are subject to regulation by federal, state, and local authorities establishing investigation and health and environmental quality standards, and liability related thereto, and providing penalties for violations of those standards. We also are subject to laws, ordinances, and regulations governing investigation and remediation of contamination at facilities we operate or to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment, recycling, or disposal. In particular, CERCLA imposes joint, strict, and several liability on owners or operators of facilities at, from, or to which a release of hazardous substances has occurred; parties that generated hazardous substances that were released at such facilities; and parties that transported or arranged for the transportation of hazardous substances to such facilities. A majority of states have adopted statutes comparable to and, in some cases, more stringent than CERCLA. If we were to be found to be a responsible party under CERCLA or a similar state statute, we could be held liable for all investigative and remedial costs associated with addressing such contamination. In addition, claims alleging personal injury or property damage may be brought against us as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances resulting from our operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of significant administrative, civil or criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, revocation of permits, and orders to limit or cease certain operations. In addition, certain environmental laws impose strict and/or joint and several liability, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time of those actions. For example, if a landfill or disposal operator mismanages our wastes in a way that creates an environmental hazard, we and all others who sent materials could become liable for cleanup costs, fines and other expenses many years after the disposal or recycling was completed. Future events, such as the discovery of currently unknown matters, spills caused by future pipeline ruptures, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation, and more vigorous enforcement policies by regulatory agencies, may give rise to additional expenditures or liabilities, which could impair our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future capital expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing, including regulation of the quantities, sources and methods of water use and disposal, could result in reduction in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells or minimize water use or disposal, which could adversely impact the demand for our services.\nDemand for our services depends, in large part, on the level of exploration and production of oil and natural gas and the oil and natural gas industry\u2019s willingness to purchase our services. Most of our customer base uses hydraulic fracturing to drill new oil and natural gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that is used to release hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from certain geological formations. The process involves the injection of water (typically mixed with significant quantities of sand and small quantities of chemical additives) under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate movement of hydrocarbons through the formation. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions and has been exempt (except when the fracturing fluids or propping agents contain diesel fuels) since 2005 from United States federal regulation pursuant to the SDWA.\nThe EPA is conducting a comprehensive study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives is also conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. The results of the EPA study and House investigation could lead to restrictions on hydraulic fracturing. On February 11, 2014, the EPA released revised underground injection control (UIC) program permitting guidance for wells that use diesel fuels during hydraulic fracturing activities. The EPA developed the guidance to clarify how companies can comply with a law passed by Congress in 2005, which exempted hydraulic fracturing operations from the requirement to obtain a UIC permit, except in cases where diesel fuel is used as a fracturing fluid. On July 16, 2015, the EPA\u2019s Inspector General (IG) issued a report entitled \u201cEnhanced EPA Oversight and Action Can Further Protect Water Resources From the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing\u201d stating that the EPA should enhance its oversight of permit issuance for hydraulic fracturing by state and develop a plan for responding to concerns about chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. On May 19, 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking announcing its intention to develop a rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (\u201cTSCA\u201d) to require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and the EPA\u2019s current regulatory agenda estimates that the proposed TSCA rule will be issued in June 2018. On October 15, 2012, the new EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act went into effect that require reductions in certain criteria and hazardous air pollutant emissions from hydraulic fracturing wells.\nOn June 13, 2016, the EPA finalized regulations under the Clean Water Act to prohibit wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production to municipal sewage plants (called publicly owned treatment works (POTWs)), with an effective date of August 29, 2016. In December 2016, the EPA announced that it was extending the compliance date of this new rule to August 29, 2019 for those onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities that had been lawfully discharging extraction wastewater to POTWs prior to August 29, 2019, while keeping the August 29, 2016 effective date for all other facilities. In December 2016, the EPA issued a final report entitled \u201cHydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States\u201d that concluded that hydraulic fracturing can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, but stated that the national frequency of impacts on drinking water could not be estimated due to significant data gaps and uncertainties in the available data. In March 2015, the Department of the Interior (\u201cDOI\u201d) issued regulations requiring that hydraulic fracturing wells constructed on federal lands comply with certain standards and requiring companies engaged in hydraulic fracturing on federal lands to disclose certain chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The regulations were enjoined by a federal district court in June 2016, and the DOI is currently appealing the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, including, for example, requiring disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process or seeking to repeal the exemption from the SWDA. If adopted, such legislation would add an additional level of regulation and necessary permitting at the federal level and could make it more difficult to complete wells using hydraulic fracturing. Similar laws and regulations with respect to chemical disclosure also exist or are being considered in several states, including certain states in which we operate, that could restrict hydraulic fracturing. The Delaware River Basin Commission is also considering regulations which may impact \u201chydrofracturing\u201d water practices in certain areas of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware. Some local governments have also sought to restrict drilling in certain areas.\nAdditionally, in response to concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced waters into underground wells, certain regulators have adopted or are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in January 2012, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources issued a temporary\nmoratorium on the development of hydraulic fracturing disposal wells in northeast Ohio due to minor earthquakes reported in the area. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (the \"RRC\") amended its existing oil and natural gas disposal well regulations to require applicants for new disposal wells to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey to assess whether the RRC should impose limits on existing wells, including a temporary injection ban. Finally, the state of Arkansas imposed a moratorium on waste water injection in certain areas due to concerns that hydraulic fracturing may be related to increased earthquake activity. Such laws and regulations could delay or curtail production of oil and natural gas by our customers, and thus reduce demand for our services.\nFuture United States federal, state or local laws or regulations could significantly restrict, or increase costs associated with hydraulic fracturing and make it more difficult or costly for producers to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, which could result in a decline in exploration and production. New laws and regulations, and new enforcement policies by regulatory agencies, could also expressly restrict the quantities, sources and methods of water use and disposal in hydraulic fracturing and otherwise increase our costs and our customers\u2019 cost of compliance, which could minimize water use and disposal needs even if other limits on drilling and completing new wells were not imposed. Any decline in exploration and production or any restrictions on water use and disposal could result in a decline in demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDelays or restrictions in obtaining permits by our customers for their operations or by us for our operations could impair our business.\nIn most states, our customers are required to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to perform drilling and completion activities and we may be required to procure permits for construction and operation of our disposal wells and pipelines. Such permits are typically required by state agencies, but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where our, or our customers\u2019, activities will be conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions which may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Delays or restrictions in obtaining saltwater disposal well permits could adversely impact our growth, which is dependent in part on new disposal capacity.\nOur customers have been affected by moratoriums that have been imposed on the issuance of permits for drilling and completion activities in certain jurisdictions. For example, in December 2010, the State of New York imposed a moratorium on certain drilling and completion activities. In 2011, the state announced plans to lift the moratorium, however, in December 2014 the state announced that it intended to take action to prohibit certain drilling and completion activities, including hydraulic fracturing, in the state. A similar moratorium has been in place within the Delaware River Basin pending issuance of regulations by the Delaware River Basin Commission. Other states, including Texas, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Wyoming and Colorado, have enacted laws and regulations applicable to our business activities, including disclosure of information regarding the substances used in hydraulic fracturing. California is presently considering similar requirements. The EPA published a rule on January 9, 2014 requiring oil and natural gas companies using hydraulic fracturing off the coast of California to disclose the chemicals they discharge into the ocean. Some of the drilling and completion activities of our customers may take place on federal land, requiring leases from the federal government to conduct such drilling and completion activities. In some cases, federal agencies have canceled oil and natural gas leases on federal lands. Consequently, our operations in certain areas of the country may be interrupted or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenue and potentially having a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to the trucking safety regulations, which are likely to be amended, and made stricter, as part of the initiative known as Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or \u201cCSA.\u201d If our current USDOT safety rating of \u201cSatisfactory\u201d is downgraded in connection with this initiative, our business and results of our operations may be adversely affected.\nAs part of the CSA initiative, the FMCSA is continuously revising its safety rating methodology and implementation of the same. These revisions will likely link safety ratings more closely to roadside inspection and driver violation data gathered and analyzed from month to month under the FMCSA\u2019s new Safety Measurement System, or \u201cSMS\u201d and may place increased scrutiny on carriers transporting significant quantities of hazardous material. This linkage could result in greater variability in safety ratings than the current system. Preliminary studies by transportation consulting firms indicate that \u201cSatisfactory\u201d ratings (or any equivalent under a new SMS-based system) may become more difficult to achieve and maintain under such a system. If our operations lose their current \u201cSatisfactory\u201d rating, which is the highest and best rating under this initiative, we may lose some of our customer contracts that require such a rating, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 92395, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "NES"}
