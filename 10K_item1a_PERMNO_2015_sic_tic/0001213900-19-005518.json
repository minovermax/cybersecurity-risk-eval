{"cik": "1720201", "company": "iPic Entertainment Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur long-term success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully identify and secure appropriate sites and timely develop and expand our operations in existing and new markets.\nOne of the key means of achieving our growth strategies will be through opening and operating new iPic locations on a profitable basis for the foreseeable future. We must identify target markets where we can enter or expand, taking into account numerous factors such as the location, demographics, traffic patterns and information gathered from our various contacts. We may not be able to open our planned new iPic locations within budget or on a timely basis, if at all, given the uncertainty of these factors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we operate more iPic locations, our rate of expansion relative to the size of our location base will eventually decline.\nThe number and timing of new locations opened during any given period may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, without limitation:\n\u25cf the cost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and pre-opening expenses;\n\u25cf the substantial doubt of the company to continue as a going concern;\n\u25cf the identification and availability of attractive sites for new iPic locations and the ability to negotiate suitable lease terms;\n\u25cf the lack of development and overall decrease in commercial real estate due to a macroeconomic downturn;\n\u25cf recruitment and training of qualified personnel in the local market;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain all required governmental permits, including zonal approvals, on a timely basis;\n\u25cf our ability to control construction and development costs of new locations;\n\u25cf competition in new markets, including competition for appropriate sites;\n\u25cf failure of the landlords to timely deliver real estate to us;\n\u25cf the proximity of potential sites to an existing iPic, and the impact of cannibalization on future growth; and\n\u25cf anticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new iPic locations.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand as we may not correctly analyze the suitability of a location or anticipate all of the challenges imposed by expanding our operations. Our growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new location may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits. In addition, as has happened when other restaurant concepts have tried to expand, we may find that our concept has limited appeal in new markets or we may experience a decline in the popularity of our concept in the markets in which we operate. If we are unable to expand in existing markets or penetrate new markets, our ability to increase our revenues and profitability may be materially harmed or we may face losses.\nOptimizing our theater circuit through new construction and the transformation of our existing theaters is subject to delay and unanticipated costs.\nThe availability of attractive site locations for new theater construction is subject to various factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf local conditions, such as scarcity of space or increase in demand for real estate, demographic changes and changes in zoning and tax laws; and\n\u25cf competition for site locations from both theater companies and other businesses.\nWe typically require 24 to 36 months from the time we reach an agreement with a landlord to when a new theater opens. In addition, improving our existing theaters is subject to substantial risks such as difficulty obtaining permits, landlord approvals and new types of operating licenses (e.g. liquor licenses). We may also experience cost overruns from delays or other unanticipated costs in both new construction and facility improvements. Furthermore, our new sites and transformed locations may not perform to our expectations.\nOur failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nOur growth plan includes a significant number of potential new iPic locations, including potential international locations. Our existing management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may not be adequate, as we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control framework, to support our planned expansion. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to locate, hire, train and retain management and operating personnel, particularly in new markets. We may not be able to respond on a timely basis to all of the changing demands that our planned expansion will impose on management and on our existing infrastructure, or be able to hire or retain the necessary management and operating personnel, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. These demands could cause us to operate our existing business less effectively, which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our existing locations. If we experience a decline in financial performance, we may decrease the number of or discontinue new openings, or we may decide to close locations that we are unable to operate in a profitable manner.\nOur theaters and restaurants operate in highly competitive environments.\nThe motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry. Our theaters are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which we operate. Competitors may be national circuits, regional circuits or smaller independent exhibitors. Moviegoers are not as brand conscious as certain other types of consumers and usually choose a theater based on its location, the films showing there, showtimes and its amenities. Competition among theater exhibition companies is often intense with respect to the following factors:\n\u25cf Attracting patrons. The competition for patrons is dependent upon factors such as the availability of popular motion pictures, the location and number of theaters and screens in a market, the comfort and quality of the theaters and pricing. Many of our competitors have sought to increase the number of screens that they operate and provide a more luxurious experience by enhancing food and beverage options and installing recliner seating. Certain of the larger theater chains, such as AMC and Regal, have been converting some of their existing theaters to include in-theater dining and recliner seating, often at the same price or a marginally higher price than their traditional theaters. Should other theater operators in our markets choose to implement these or other initiatives, the performance of our theaters may be significantly and negatively impacted.\n\u25cf Licensing motion pictures. We believe that the principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include licensing terms, number of seats and screens available for a particular picture, revenue potential and the location and condition of an exhibitor\u2019s theaters. Should any of our existing principal competitive factors change, the performance of our theaters may be significantly and negatively impacted.\n\u25cf New sites and acquisitions. We must compete with exhibitors and others in our efforts to locate and acquire attractive new and existing sites for our iPic locations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire such new sites or existing theaters at reasonable prices or on favorable terms. Moreover, some of these competitors may be stronger financially than we are. As a result of the foregoing, we may not succeed in acquiring theaters or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition.\n\u25cf Multiple competitors for both out-of-home and in-home entertainment. The theatrical exhibition industry faces competition from other forms of out-of-home entertainment, such as concerts, amusement parks and sporting events and from other distribution channels for filmed entertainment, such as cable television, pay-per-view, video on demand, subscription based video streaming services, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu, and home video systems and from other forms of in-home or on-the-go entertainment.\n\u25cf New technology. New innovations and technology will continue to impact our industry. If we are unable to respond to or invest in future technology and the changing preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could also adversely affect our results of operations.\nLike the motion picture exhibition industry, the restaurant industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry. We compete in the restaurant industry with multi-unit national, regional and locally-owned and/or operated limited-service restaurants and full-service restaurants. Many of our competitors offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. Many of our competitors have existed longer than we have and may have a more established market presence, better locations and greater name recognition nationally or in some of the local markets in which we operate or plan to operate.\nWe face significant competition for restaurant guests, and our inability to compete effectively may affect our traffic, iPic sales and store-level operating profit margins.\nWe rely on our food and beverage service for a majority of our revenue. The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with many well-established companies that compete directly and indirectly with us with respect to food quality, service, price and value, design and location. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have greater name recognition nationally or in some of the local markets in which we have or plan to have an iPic. Any inability to successfully compete with the restaurants in our markets will place downward pressure on our guest traffic and may prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability.\nNew iPic locations, once opened, may not be profitable.\nOur results have been, and in the future may continue to be, significantly impacted by the timing of new location openings (often dictated by factors outside of our control), including landlord delays, associated pre-opening expenses and operating inefficiencies, as well as changes in our geographic concentration due to the opening of new locations. We typically incur the most significant portion of pre-opening expenses associated with a given location within the six months preceding the opening. Our experience has been that labor and operating costs associated with a newly opened location for the first several months of operation are materially greater than what can be expected after that time, both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of sales. Our new locations commonly take 16 to 20 weeks to reach planned operating expense levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new openings, including the training of new personnel, new market learning curves, inability to hire sufficient qualified staff and other factors. We may incur additional costs in new markets, particularly for transportation and distribution, which may impact the profitability of those locations. Accordingly, the volume and timing of new openings may have a material adverse impact on our profitability.\nAlthough we target specified operating and financial metrics, new locations may not meet these targets or may take longer than anticipated to do so. Any new location we open may not be profitable or achieve operating results similar to those of our existing locations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not achieve the expected benefits and performance from strategic theater acquisitions.\nFrom time to time we evaluate strategic theater acquisitions. In any acquisition, we expect to benefit from cost savings through, for example, the reduction of overhead and theater level costs, and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition. However, there can be no assurance that our lender would consent to any proposed acquisition, and even if it did consent to such acquisition, that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits, nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions. Any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:\n\u25cf the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the acquired operations and personnel into our current business;\n\u25cf the potential disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources;\n\u25cf the possible inability of management to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cf the risks of entering markets in which we have little or no experience;\n\u25cf the potential impairment of relationships with employees;\n\u25cf the possibility that any liabilities we may incur or assume may prove to be more burdensome than anticipated; and\n\u25cf the possibility that the acquired theaters do not perform as expected.\nWe have no control over distributors of the films and our business may be adversely affected if our access to motion pictures is limited or delayed.\nWe rely on distributors of motion pictures, over whom we have no control, for the films that we exhibit. Major motion picture distributors are required by law to offer and license film to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theater-by-theater basis. Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theater-by-theater basis. Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors, as this affects our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films or to obtain licenses at all. With only seven distributors representing approximately 87% of the U.S. box office in 2018, there is a high level of concentration in the industry. Our business may be adversely affected if our access to motion pictures is limited or delayed because of deterioration in our relationships with one or more distributors, or for some other reason. To the extent that we are unable to license a popular film for exhibition in our theaters, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. In addition, changes to our licensing terms may cause the performance of our theaters to be significantly and negatively impacted.\nWe depend on motion picture production and performance.\nOur ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets. Our revenues are dependent upon the timing and popularity of film releases by distributors. The most marketable films are usually released during the summer and the calendar year-end holiday seasons. Therefore, our business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and holiday seasons. We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios. Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations. Conversely, the successful performance of these motion pictures, particularly the sustained success of any one motion picture, or an increase in effective marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, may generate positive results for our business and operations in a specific quarter or year that may not necessarily be indicative of, or comparable to, future results of operations. Given the relatively small number of theaters and screens that we operate (particularly when compared to our larger competitors), if a major motion picture studio decides to delay the release of a first-run motion picture from one quarter to a subsequent quarter, that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the earlier quarter. As movie studios rely on a smaller number of higher grossing \u201ctent pole\u201d films, there may be increased pressure for higher film licensing fees. In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers. As a result of the foregoing factors, our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year.\nThe motion picture exhibition industry has experienced fluctuations in attendance during recent years.\nThe U.S. motion picture exhibition industry has been subject to periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance and box office revenues. According to the Motion Picture Association of America, attendance at movies in the United States and Canada was 1.31 billion during 2018, 1.24 billion during 2017, and 1.32 billion during 2016. During the past ten years, attendance at movies in the United States and Canada has ranged from a high of 1.42 billion in 2009 to a low of 1.24 billion in 2017. We expect the cyclical nature of the U.S. motion picture exhibition industry to continue for the foreseeable future, and any decline in attendance could materially adversely affect our results of operations. To offset any decrease in attendance, we plan to offer products unique to the motion picture exhibition industry, such as specially selected alternative programming and a luxury in-theater dining experience. We cannot assure you, however, that our offering of such content and services will offset any decrease in attendance that the industry may experience.\nAn increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods or other forms of entertainment may drive down our attendance and limit our ticket prices.\nWe compete with other film delivery methods, including video streaming and downloads via the Internet, network, syndicated cable and satellite television and DVDs, as well as video-on-demand and pay-per-view services. We also compete for the public\u2019s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, amusement parks, live music concerts and live theater. An increase in the popularity of these alternative film delivery methods and other forms of entertainment could reduce attendance at our theaters, limit the prices we can charge for admission and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be impacted by shrinking video release windows.\nOver the last decade, the average video release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film\u2019s theatrical release to the date a film is available on subscription based video streaming services, DVD or similar on-demand release to an important downstream market, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three months. If patrons choose to wait for a DVD release, video streaming or other home entertainment options rather than attend a theater for viewing the film, it may materially adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Several major film studios have tested premium video-on-demand products released in homes approximately simultaneously with a movie\u2019s theatrical debut, which threatened the length of the release window. Additionally, for the past several years, Amazon Studios has been producing and acquiring original movies for theatrical release with video streaming available just four to eight weeks after their theatrical debut. We cannot assure you that the release window, which is determined by the film studios, will not shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur continued success depends in part on the continued popularity of our menu and the experience we offer guests.\nConsumer tastes, nutritional and dietary trends, traffic patterns and the type, number, and location of competing restaurants often affect the restaurant business and our competitors may react more efficiently and effectively to those conditions. In addition, some of our competitors in the past have implemented programs that provide price discounts on certain menu offerings, and they may continue to do so in the future. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our traffic, sales and store-level operating profit margins could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nFood safety and food-borne illness incidents could adversely affect guests\u2019 perception of our brand, result in lower sales and increase operating costs.\nFood safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to help ensure that our guests enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food-borne illnesses and other food safety issues have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. A negative report or negative publicity, whether or not related to one of our iPic locations, may have an adverse impact on demand for our food and could result in decreased guest traffic to our locations. A decrease in guest traffic to our iPic locations as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could materially harm our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, our reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple iPic locations would be affected. We cannot ensure that all food items will be properly maintained during transport throughout the supply chain and that our employees will identify all products that may be spoiled and should not be used. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some locations. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination, whether or not at iPic, could subject us or our suppliers to a food recall pursuant to the United States Food and Drug Administration\u2019s recently enacted Food Safety Modernization Act.\nRestaurant companies have been the target of class action lawsuits and other proceedings that are costly, divert management attention and, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial damages or settlement costs.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, guests, suppliers, licensees, stockholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. In recent years, restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, overtime eligibility and failure to pay for all hours worked. Along those lines, a class action lawsuit was filed against us in California state court in December 2017 asserting failure to pay minimum wage, pay overtime wages, provide meal breaks and rest periods, and provide accurate itemized wage statements with respect to certain workers. On February 6, 2019, the parties reached a preliminary agreement to settle the lawsuit for $1.5 million. The parties are in the process of negotiating a settlement agreement for submission to the court for preliminary approval of the settlement. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the settlement.\nOccasionally, our guests file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to one of our locations, including actions seeking damages resulting from food-borne illness or accidents at our locations. We are also subject to a variety of other claims from third parties arising in the ordinary course of our business, including contract claims.\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations. In addition, they may generate negative publicity, which could reduce guest traffic and sales. Although we maintain what we believe to be adequate levels of insurance to cover any of these liabilities, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur plans to open new locations, and the ongoing need for capital expenditures at our existing locations, require us to expend capital.\nOur growth strategy depends on opening new locations, which will require us to use cash flows from operations and raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital to implement our growth strategy. If our cash is not allocated efficiently among our various projects, or if any of these initiatives prove to be unsuccessful, we may experience reduced profitability and we could be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate planned openings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIn addition, as our locations mature, our business will require capital expenditures for the maintenance, renovation and improvement of existing locations to remain competitive and maintain the value of our brand standard. For example, in 2018 we invested $10.9 million to upgrade our Generation I theaters to Generation III theaters. This creates an ongoing need for capital, and, to the extent we cannot fund capital expenditures from cash flows from operations, funds will need to be borrowed or otherwise obtained. If we cannot access the capital we need, we may not be able to execute on our growth strategy, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.\nIf the costs of funding new locations or renovations or enhancements at existing iPic locations exceed budgeted amounts, and/or the time for building or renovation is longer than anticipated, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing property subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.\nWe do not own any real property and all of our iPic locations are located in leased premises. The leases for our locations generally have initial terms of 15 to 25 years and typically provide for two to four renewal options in five-year increments as well as for rent escalations.\nGenerally, our leases are net leases that require us to pay our share of the costs of real estate taxes, utilities, building operating expenses, insurance and other charges in addition to rent. We generally cannot cancel these leases. Additional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases. If we close a unit, we nonetheless may be obligated to perform our monetary obligations under the applicable lease, including, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close locations in desirable locations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were a party to operating leases associated with our iPic locations and administrative offices requiring future minimum lease payments of approximately $499 million, which minimum lease commitments are not reflected as liabilities on our balance sheet. The future minimum lease payments associated with locations that are under development as at December 31, 2018 is approximately $48.2 million. We depend on cash flows from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under the non-revolving credit facility (the \u201cNon-Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) with RSA or other sources, we may not be able to service our lease expenses or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur substantial debt could materially adversely affect our operations and prevent us from satisfying those debt obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding $188 million of indebtedness under our Non-Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018, we also had approximately $499 million of undiscounted rental payments under operating leases (with initial base terms generally between 15 to 25 years). The amount of our remaining indebtedness and lease and other financial obligations could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of lease rentals and principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for operations and any future growth or other business opportunities;\n\u25cf limit our planning flexibility for, or ability to react to, changes in our business and the industry; and\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness and other obligations or greater access to financing.\nIf we fail to make any required payment under our Non-Revolving Credit Facility or to comply with any of the financial and operating covenants contained therein, we would be in default. Lenders under our Non-Revolving Credit Facility could then vote to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the Non-Revolving Credit Facility and foreclose upon the property that is pledged to secure the Non-Revolving Credit Facility, which property includes substantially all the assets of iPic-Gold Class and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, together with 100% of the equity interests of iPic-Gold Class. Other creditors might then accelerate other indebtedness. If the lenders under the Non-Revolving Credit Facility accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness thereunder, we might not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under the Non-Revolving Credit Facility or our other indebtedness.\nLimitations on the availability of capital may prevent deployment of strategic initiatives.\nOur key strategic initiatives, including future upgrades of our Generation II locations into our latest Generation III furniture, fixture and equipment, require significant capital expenditures to implement. Our net capital expenditures aggregated approximately $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For calendar year 2019, we estimate that our gross cash outflows for capital expenditures will be approximately $37.0 million to $39.0 million, inclusive of $11.0 million to $13.0 million expected to be supplied in the form of tenant improvement financing. The lack of available capital resources due to business performance or other financial commitments could prevent or delay the deployment of innovations in our theaters and restaurants. We may have to seek additional financing or issue additional securities to fully implement our growth strategy. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain new financing on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, covenants under our existing indebtedness limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, and the performance of any additional or improved theaters and restaurants may not be sufficient to service the related indebtedness that we are permitted to incur.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that may limit our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities advantageous to us.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders;\n\u25cf make restricted payments;\n\u25cf incur liens;\n\u25cf engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25cf enter into business combinations.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.\nWe have a limited operating history which provides limited reference for you to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nWe were formed in September 2010. Since we have a limited operating history, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with early stage companies and have historically operated at a loss. Accordingly, you will have a limited basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objectives. As of the date hereof, we have 16 locations and have an additional 3 locations under construction. Our financial condition, results of operations and our future success will, to a significant extent, depend on our ability to continue to open restaurants and theaters throughout the United States and internationally and to achieve economies of scale. We cannot assure you that more restaurants and theaters can be opened on terms favorable to us or at all, or that if we open those restaurants and theaters, we will be able to operate our expanded business profitably. If we fail to achieve our business objectives, then we may not be able to realize our expected revenue growth, maintain our existing revenue levels or operate at a profit. Even if we do realize our business objectives, our business may not be profitable in the future.\nWe have had significant financial losses in previous years.\nHistorically, we have had operating losses, negative cash flows from operations and working capital deficiencies. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we reported net losses of $56.8 million and $44.5 million, respectively. We expect to have significant net losses and negative cash flow for at least the next several years, as we incur additional costs and expenses for the continued development of new iPic locations. Whether, and when, the Company can attain profitability and positive cash flows from operations is uncertain. If we experience losses in the future, we may be unable to meet our payment obligations on our existing indebtedness, while attempting to expand our theater circuit and withstand competitive pressures or adverse economic conditions.\nOur sales growth and ability to achieve profitability could be adversely affected if comparable-store sales decline or are less than we expect.\nComparable-store sales, a non-GAAP measure, are a year-over-year comparison of sales at iPic locations open at the end of the period which have been open for at least 12 months prior to the start of such quarterly period. It is a key performance indicator used within the industry and is indicative of acceptance of our initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. The level of comparable-store sales will affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting our ability to generate profits because the profit margin on comparable-store sales is generally higher than the profit margin on new store sales. Our ability to increase comparable-store sales depends in part on our ability to successfully implement our initiatives to build sales. It is possible such initiatives will not be successful, and that we will not achieve our target comparable-store sales growth or that our comparable-store sales could decline, which may cause a decrease in sales growth and ability to achieve profitability that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to the timing of new iPic location openings and the relatively small number of iPic locations currently in operation.\nThe timing of new iPic location openings may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly performance. We typically incur most cash pre-opening expenses for a new iPic within the six months immediately preceding, and the month of, the iPic\u2019s opening. In addition, the labor and operating costs for a newly opened iPic during the first three to six months of operation are materially greater than what can be expected after that time, both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues. Additionally, we typically incur capital expenditures related to new iPic locations in the year prior to opening. Due to these substantial up-front financial requirements to open new iPic locations, the investment risk related to any single iPic is much larger than that associated with many other restaurants or entertainment venues.\nSimilarly, with respect to revenues, there is some ramp-up time following the opening of a new iPic during which time revenues from that particular location have not yet achieved what is to be expected once the location has been open for a period of three years. This will affect our revenues during periods when we open up one or more new iPic locations.\nFurthermore, because we currently operate at only 16 locations, a problem at any one location may have a significant impact on our results of operations from period to period. For example, Hurricane Harvey negatively impacted our location in Houston, TX and Hurricane Irma negatively impacted our locations in Miami, FL and Boca Raton, FL, during the six months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe impact that general economic, political and social conditions in the United States have on consumer discretionary spending could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur success depends on general economic, political and social conditions and the willingness of consumers to spend money at restaurants and movie theaters. Any significant decrease in consumer confidence, or periods of economic slowdown or recession, could lead to a curtailing of discretionary spending, which in turn could reduce our revenues and results of operations and materially adversely affect our financial position. Our business is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending and therefore is affected by consumer confidence as well as the future performance of the United States economy. As a result, our results of operations are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions. Increases in job losses, home foreclosures, energy prices, investment losses in the financial markets, personal bankruptcies, credit card debt and home mortgage and other borrowing costs, declines in housing values and reduced access to credit, among other factors, may result in lower levels of customer traffic to our iPic locations, a decline in consumer confidence and a curtailing of consumer discretionary spending. We believe that consumers generally are more willing to make discretionary purchases during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. If economic conditions worsen, whether in the United States or in the communities in which our iPic locations are located, we could see deterioration in customer traffic or a reduction in the average amount customers spend in our iPic locations.\nGeopolitical events, including the threat of domestic terrorism, gun violence or cyber-attacks, could cause people to avoid our theaters or other public places where large crowds are in attendance. For example, in the United States over the past several years, there have been several high-profile incidents involving shootings at movie theaters. In addition, due to our concentration in certain markets, natural or man-made disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, severe weather conditions, local strikes or increases in energy prices in those markets could adversely affect our overall results of operations.\nIn the event of our expected international expansion, the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business.\nIn the future, we expect to open up iPic locations outside of the United States, including in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. If we expand internationally, we will become subject to the risks of doing business outside the United States, including:\n\u25cf Our business model is unproven outside the United States;\n\u25cf changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we choose to operate;\n\u25cf the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate non-U.S. earnings in a tax effective manner;\n\u25cf the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets;\n\u25cf the ability to comply with, or impact of complying with, complex and changing laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations, including foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, tariffs, embargoes, intellectual property, licensing requirements and regulations, increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws;\n\u25cf the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries;\n\u25cf the ability to comply with, or impact of complying with, complex and changing laws, regulations and economic and political policies of the U.S. government, including U.S. laws and regulations relating to economic sanctions, export controls and anti-boycott requirements;\n\u25cf increases in anti-American sentiment and the identification of the licensed brand as an American brand;\n\u25cf the effect of disruptions caused by severe weather, natural disasters, outbreak of disease or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult; and\n\u25cf political and economic instability.\nAny or all of these factors may materially adversely affect the performance of our iPic locations located in international markets. In particular, Saudi Arabia, where the Company expects to open its first international iPic location, is a volatile region that is subject to geopolitical and sociopolitical factors that pose risk to our business operations. In addition, developing theaters in Saudi Arabia would require us to partner with a local developer with whom we have not done business before. Partnering with a local developer entails numerous risks and we would be reliant on such partner in our development efforts. Moreover, we rely on food and beverage sales to generate a majority of our revenue, and given the strict laws in Saudi Arabia governing the sale and consumption of alcohol, our theaters in Saudi Arabia would be reliant on theater revenue and food sales. Stricter censorship standards over film content will also impact the type of film genres that we can exhibit.\nIn addition, the economy of any region in which our iPic locations are located may be adversely affected to a greater degree than that of other areas of the country or the world by certain developments affecting industries concentrated in that region or country. While these factors and the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could materially lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business.\nOur recurring operating losses, members\u2019 deficit, negative operating cash flows and working capital deficit have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have sustained recurring operating losses since our inception. In addition, we had a stockholders\u2019 / members\u2019 deficit, and a working capital deficit at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and negative operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018, which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, suppliers and employees. Our consolidated financial statements for all periods have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, our continuation as a going concern is dependent on refinancing of existing debt or obtaining additional equity. Historically, our main sources of funding have been the Non-Revolving Credit Facility, financing provided by the landlords at certain of our newly-developed locations, and funding from investors. We received capital contributions in April 2017, November 2017 and January 2018 that provided capital in the form of equity of approximately $12 million, $4 million and $2.5 million, respectively. We completed the IPO on February 1, 2018, raising approximately $13.6 million in proceeds, net of selling agent discounts and commission, but before offering expenses of approximately $1.5 million.\nManagement has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm also included explanatory going concern language in their report accompanying our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, included herein.\nIt is not possible at this time for us to predict with assurance the potential success of our business. The revenue and income potential of our business and operations are unknown. These uncertainties cast significant doubt upon our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf our cash flows prove inadequate to service our debt and provide for our other obligations, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or future debt at terms unfavorable to us.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and other financial obligations and to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate substantial operational performance improvements. This will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flows were to prove inadequate to meet our debt service, rental and other obligations in the future, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing or future debt, on or before maturity, to sell assets or to obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our Non-Revolving Credit Facility, sell any such assets or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict, but do not prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness. If we are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Non-Revolving Credit Facility and our other outstanding debt instruments, we may be able to incur additional indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face may intensify.\nWe may suffer future impairment losses and theater and other closure charges.\nThe opening of new theaters by certain of our competitors has drawn audiences away from some of our older theaters. In addition, demographic changes and competitive pressures have caused some of our theaters to become unprofitable. Since not all theaters are appropriate for our new initiatives, we may have to close certain theaters or recognize impairment losses related to the decrease in value of particular theaters. We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment as part of an ongoing process and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Deterioration in the performance of our theaters could require us to recognize additional impairment losses and close additional theaters, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. We continually monitor the performance of our theaters, and factors such as changing consumer preferences for filmed entertainment and our inability to sublease vacant retail space could negatively impact operating results and result in future closures, sales, dispositions and significant theater and other closure charges prior to expiration of underlying lease agreements. In the year ended December 31, 2018, impairment of property and equipment was $4.4 million, this was due to (i) a $1.8 million impairment charge taken at our Scottsdale, AZ location; and (ii) a $2.6 million impairment charge related to our South Barrington, IL location.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, proprietary information and other intellectual property, including our name and logos and the unique character and atmosphere of our iPic locations. We rely on trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as license agreements, nondisclosure agreements, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Nevertheless, our competitors may develop a similar character and atmosphere, menu items and concepts, and adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and other intellectual property.\nThe success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand in the markets in which we operate. We have registered and applied to register trademarks and service marks in the United States. We may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and service marks, and our competitors and others may successfully challenge the validity and/or enforceability of our trademarks and service marks and other intellectual property. We have several patents issued, as well as several pending patent applications in the United States. Such patent applications are subject to the review by and normal course prosecution before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which may result in the application\u2019s revision or non-approval. As a result, we may not be able to adequately protect the inventions covered by these patent applications, and our competitors and others may benefit as a result of their publication. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States may not be adequate. In addition, in the event we expand internationally, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nIf our efforts to maintain and protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance.\nWe may also from time to time be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights.\nThird parties may assert that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property and may sue us for intellectual property infringement. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs, and the time and attention of our management and other personnel may be diverted in pursuing these proceedings. If a court finds that we infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property, we may be required to pay damages and/or be subject to an injunction. With respect to any third party intellectual property that we use or wish to use in our business (whether or not asserted against us in litigation), we may not be able to enter into licensing or other arrangements with the owner of such intellectual property at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we incur legal liability.\nWe are subject to, and in the future may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of the merits of the claims, the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant, and such matters can be time-consuming and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nWhile we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.\nOur business is subject to risks related to our sale of alcoholic beverages.\nWe serve alcoholic beverages at all of our locations. Alcoholic beverage control regulations generally require our locations to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license that must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our locations, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. Any future failure to comply with these regulations and obtain or retain licenses could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject in certain states to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance. Recent litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments and settlements under dram shop statutes. Because these cases often seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance, such litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and resources away from operations and hurt our financial performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage or not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nShortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of food products could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our exact specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of food products caused by problems in production or distribution, inclement weather, unanticipated demand or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nDisruption of our relationships with various vendors could substantially harm our business.\nWe rely on our relationships with several key studios in the operations of our business. These relationships include:\n\u25cf Paramount Pictures/DreamWorks\n\u25cf Sony Pictures\n\u25cf 20th Century Fox\n\u25cf Universal Film Exchanges\n\u25cf Walt Disney Studio Pictures\n\u25cf Warner Brothers\nAlthough our senior management has long-standing relationships with each of these vendors, we could experience deterioration or loss of any of our vendor relationships, which would significantly disrupt our operations until an alternative source is secured.\nWe are subject to substantial government regulation, which could entail significant cost.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, equal employment, environmental, and licensing for the sale of food and, in some theaters, alcoholic beverages. Our new theater openings could be delayed or prevented, or our existing theaters could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business. A significant portion of our theater level employees are part time workers who are paid at or near the applicable minimum wage in the theater\u2019s jurisdiction. Continued increases in the minimum wage and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to building, zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to federal, state, and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions. These laws cover wage and hour practices, labor relations, paid and family leave, workplace safety, and immigration, among others. The myriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multi-state employer as different standards apply to different locations, sometimes with conflicting requirements. We must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations.\nProvisions in the Affordable Care Act require restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request. We do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with these provisions, but cannot anticipate any changes to guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur theaters that sell alcohol require each location to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license that must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our locations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We are also subject in certain states to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We may decide not to obtain liquor licenses in certain jurisdictions due to the high costs associated with obtaining liquor licenses in such jurisdictions.\nWe operate locations throughout the United States and are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of those jurisdictions, particularly laws governing the cleanup of hazardous materials and the management of properties. We might in the future be required to participate in the cleanup of a property that we lease, or at which we have been alleged to have disposed of hazardous materials from one of our locations. In certain circumstances, we might be solely responsible for any such liability under environmental laws, and such claims could be material.\nOur theaters must comply with Title III of the ADA. Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations \u201creasonably accommodate\u201d individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to \u201ccommercial facilities\u201d conform to accessibility guidelines unless \u201cstructurally impracticable\u201d for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and an award of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could negatively impact our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nWe depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.\nOur current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the retention of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss or unavailability to us, or damage to the reputation, of any member of our senior management team or a key employee - including, without limitation, Mr. Hamid Hashemi, our founder, President and CEO - could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. There is a high level of competition for experienced, successful personnel in our industry. We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms.\nWe rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and any failure to protect these systems against security breaches or failure of these systems themselves could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity and could result in litigation and penalties. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be materially harmed.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. Among other things, these systems collect and store certain personal information from customers, vendors and employees and process customer payment information. Our mobile application allows patrons to purchase tickets, select seats and order food and beverage. Our information systems and the sensitive data they are designed to protect are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers, cyber terrorists and other cyber attackers, and employees exceeding their authorized access. We rely on security measures and technology typical of our industry to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems, and we rely on our third party vendors to take appropriate measures to protect the confidentiality of the information on those information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. Our information systems may become unavailable or fail to perform as anticipated for any reason, including viruses, loss of power or human error. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or those maintained by our third party vendors or any significant breach of security could materially adversely affect (i) our reputation with our customers, vendors and employees, (ii) our brand name, and (iii) our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any of the foregoing could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. A significant interruption, failure or breach of the security of our information systems or those of our third party vendors could also require us to expend significant resources to upgrade the security measures and technology that guard sensitive data against computer hackers, cyber terrorists and other cyber attackers. We maintain cyber risk insurance coverage to protect against such risks, however, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate.\nChanges in privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nOur cinemas rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email marketing. Any expansion on existing and/or new laws and regulations regarding marketing, solicitation or data protection could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of our email and other marketing techniques and could result in changes to our marketing strategy which could adversely impact our attendance levels and revenues.\nRisks Relating to Our Organizational Structure\nOur principal asset is our interest in Holdings, and Holdings\u2019 principal asset is its interest in iPic-Gold Class, and, accordingly, we depend on distributions that iPic-Gold Class makes to Holdings and that Holdings makes to us to pay our taxes and expenses. iPic-Gold Class\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of LLC Interests of Holdings, which is itself a holding company that has no material assets other than its ownership of limited liability company interests of iPic-Gold Class. As such, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, will be dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of iPic-Gold Class and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive indirectly from iPic-Gold Class. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to directly or indirectly distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants in our debt instruments, will permit such distributions.\nBoth Holdings and iPic-Gold Class are treated as pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, will not be subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income will be allocated to holders of LLC Interests, including us. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of Holdings. Under the terms of the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Holdings (\u201cHoldings LLC Agreement\u201d), Holdings is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of LLC Interests, including us. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our operations, which we expect could be significant. We intend, as the sole manager of Holdings, which is itself the sole managing member of iPic-Gold Class, to cause iPic-Gold Class to make cash distributions to Holdings out of which (i) Holdings will make cash distributions to the owners of LLC Interests, in an amount sufficient to fund all or part of their tax obligations in respect of taxable income allocated to them and (ii) Holdings will make cash payments to us in an amount sufficient to cover our other expenses. However, Holdings\u2019 and iPic-Gold Class\u2019s ability to make such distributions and payments may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which Holdings or iPic-Gold Class is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering either Holdings or iPic-Gold Class insolvent. If we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxation by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities, and we may in the future be subject to taxation by foreign tax authorities. As a result, our tax liabilities will be affected by the allocation of expenses to differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u25cf tax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u25cf changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; or\n\u25cf future earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal, state and local taxing authorities, and we may in the future be subject to audits by foreign taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), as a result of our direct ownership of Holdings and our indirect ownership of iPic-Gold Class, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnder Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d for purposes of the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company,\u201d as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.\niPic is the sole manager of Holdings, and Holdings is the sole managing member of iPic-Gold Class. As a result, we will indirectly control and operate iPic-Gold Class. On that basis, we believe that our interest in iPic-Gold Class is not an \u201cinvestment security\u201d as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of iPic-Gold Class, our interest in iPic-Gold Class could be deemed an \u201cinvestment security\u201d for purposes of the 1940 Act.\nWe, Holdings and iPic-Gold Class intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\niPic is controlled by a small group of affiliates, whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\nAs of March 1, 2019, our directors, officers and 10% or greater stockholders control approximately 87.7% of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock through their ownership of Class A and Class B Common Stock. Such stockholders will, for the foreseeable future, have significant influence over our corporate management and affairs, and will be able to control virtually all matters requiring stockholder approval. Such stockholders are able to, subject to applicable law, elect a majority of the members of our board of directors and control actions to be taken by us and our board of directors, including amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. The directors so elected will have the authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness and applicable rules and regulations, to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions. It is possible that the interests of such stockholders may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you. For example, such stockholders that are also holders of LLC Interests may have different tax positions from us that could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, and whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, the determination of future tax reporting positions, the structuring of future transactions and the handling of any future challenges by any taxing authority to our tax reporting positions may take into consideration these holders of LLC Interests\u2019 tax or other considerations, which may differ from the considerations of us or our other stockholders.\nIn addition, certain of such stockholders are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies and hold, and may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or the business of our suppliers. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of such stockholders or any director who is not employed by us or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar lines of business as us. Such stockholders may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate and realization of our deferred tax assets may result in volatility of our operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in various U.S. jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which may include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions, and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets. At any one time, many tax years may be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. We expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by a variety of factors including but not limited to changes in the mix and level of earnings, varying tax rates in the different jurisdictions in which we operate, fluctuations in the valuation allowance or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Further, tax legislation may be enacted in the future which could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates.\nWe are subject to complex taxation and could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to many different forms of taxation in the U.S. and, should we expand internationally, we will also be subject to different forms of taxation in those foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The tax authorities may not agree with the determinations that we made and such disagreements could result in lengthy legal disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of substantial amounts for tax, interest and penalties, which could have a material impact on our results. Additionally, current economic and political conditions make tax rates in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRecently enacted changes to the U.S. tax laws may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition.\nOn December 20, 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate each voted to approve the Tax Cut and Jobs Act and, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cut and Jobs Act into law. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act includes provisions that, among other things, reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate, introduce a deduction for certain income earned through pass-through entities, introduce a capital investment deduction, limit the interest deduction, limit the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income, and make extensive changes to the U.S. international tax system, including the taxation of the accumulated foreign earnings. The limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income could result in iPic being required to pay cash taxes or Holdings\u2019 being required to make tax distributions in earlier years than previously anticipated. In addition, the limitation on the interest deduction could result in the deferral of interest deductions on a portion of our indebtedness to subsequent years (in which our interest deductions would also be subject to limitation and potential deferral), which could materially increase iPic\u2019s liability for taxes or the amount of tax distributions Holdings would be required to make in any affected years. Other provisions of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, such as the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate and the capital investment deduction, could have the effect of reducing the amount of taxes to which iPic would otherwise have been subject or the amount of tax distributions Holdings would otherwise be required to make in a particular taxable year.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile, and the value of your investment may decline.\nThe trading price of our Class A Common Stock has been volatile since our IPO. Since shares of our Class A Common Stock began trading on NASDAQ in February 2018, the reported high and low sales prices of our Class A Common Stock have ranged from $17.00 to $2.02 through March 1, 2019. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may have a significant impact on the market price of our Class A Common Stock:\n\u25cf announcements of innovations or new services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf any adverse changes to our relationship with our customers or suppliers;\n\u25cf variations in the costs of products that we use in our restaurants or theaters;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our competitors or the restaurant and movie theater industry in general;\n\u25cf achievement of expected sales and profitability;\n\u25cf supply or distribution shortages;\n\u25cf adverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our services or the products we use;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf trading volume of our Class A Common Stock;\n\u25cf sales of our Class A Common Stock by us, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders in the future;\n\u25cf general economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity markets;\n\u25cf actual or perceived risks that our Class A Common Stock will be delisted; and\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles.\nIn addition, broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance, and factors beyond our control may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly.\nWe have received delisting notices from NASDAQ in the past and our stock is subject to delisting risk in the future.\nOn December 28, 2018, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market stating that for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the letter, we did not meet the minimum market value of listed securities of $35,000,000 required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), Nasdaq provided us with 180 calendar days to regain compliance. On March 12, 2019, we received notice from NASDAQ that for ten consecutive business days, the Company\u2019s market value of listed securities had been $35,000,000 or greater and therefore the Company regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). In addition, we transferred our Class A common stock from The Nasdaq Global Select Market to The Nasdaq Capital Market effective August 10, 2018. As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K filing dated as of May 9, 2018, this transfer followed a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market dated May 9, 2018 notifying us that for the past 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the letter, the Company did not meet the minimum market value of publicly held shares of $15,000,000 required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(3)(C).\nThere is no assurance that the Company will meet the minimum market value of listed securities for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) in the future or that we will continue to comply with other Nasdaq listing requirements. If our Class A Common Stock were to be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock would be materially impacted.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nThe holders of LLC Interests have the right to have their LLC Interests redeemed pursuant to the terms of the Holdings LLC Agreement.\nAs of March 1, 2019, we have an aggregate of 92,855,867 shares of Class A Common Stock authorized but unissued. The holders of our Class B Common Stock are generally entitled to have their corresponding LLC Interests redeemed for shares of our Class A Common Stock, subject to certain restrictions contained in the Holdings LLC Agreement. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A Common Stock may have on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition, or the perception that such sales or distributions could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. The shares of Class A Common Stock issued in our IPO are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act.\nOn February 1, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register all shares of Class A Common Stock issued or issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under our stock plans and outstanding IPO Restricted Stock Units. Accordingly, shares registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market following the expiration of the applicable lock-up period, upon exercise of options vested at such time.\nMoreover, holders of an aggregate of 7,432,377 shares of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may also issue additional securities if we need to raise capital, which could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our markets, or if they adversely change their recommendations or publish negative reports regarding our business or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nStockholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common stock, if any, for any return on their investment because we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, we expect that only appreciation of the price of our common stock, if any, will provide a return to investors in our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and NASDAQ, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of Exchange Act, the corporate governance standards of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and NASDAQ. As a result, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other costs that we did not incur as a private company. These requirements will place a strain on our management, systems and resources and we will incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we have not incurred as a private company. The Exchange Act requires us to file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition within specified time periods and to prepare a proxy statement with respect to our annual meeting of stockholders. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. NASDAQ requires that we comply with various corporate governance requirements. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and comply with the Exchange Act and NASDAQ requirements, significant resources and management oversight will be required. This may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and lead to significant costs associated with compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on us and the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe have had difficulty and paid significantly more to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. Going forward we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt even more changes in governance and reporting requirements. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of these costs.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, we have identified the following material weaknesses in internal control:\n\u00b7 We do not have an effective control environment because we do not have formalized internal control policies and procedures. Specifically, the Company has not yet designed an effective system of internal control over financial reporting.\n\u00b7 We also identified material weaknesses related to our lack of adequate review of complex accounting matters. Specifically, we have not yet designed precise enough review controls in order to identify material misstatements relating to complex accounting matters, including review controls over the preparation of our long-lived asset impairment evaluation and other areas.\n\u00b7 We also identified material weaknesses relating to improperly designed period end financial reporting controls. Specifically, we have not yet designed suitable review controls governing the review of financial statements and accounting records. Additionally, the Company does not have adequate review controls over our periodic financial reporting including maintaining sufficient monitoring controls over the recording of journal entries and maintaining sufficient segregation of duties.\nWe are implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate these material weaknesses, including controls designed to require reviews of complex areas in a timely manner. In addition, we are designing and implementing improved processes and internal controls throughout the organization, including enhancing our control environment and redesigning and implementing controls over information technology and our period end financial reporting process such as formalizing our internal control documentation and strengthening supervisory reviews by our management. While we are designing, documenting and implementing improved processes and internal controls, we have implemented processes to perform the evaluation required to comply with Section 404; however, we cannot predict the success of such measures or the outcome of our assessment of these measures at this time. We can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date which is the later of the date we are an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We will be required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff. We have begun the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404, when applicable, and we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions that:\n\u25cf authorize blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u25cf limit the liability of, and provide indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u25cf limit the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u25cf require advance notice of stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u25cf require that directors only be removed from office for cause; and\n\u25cf limit the determination of the number of directors on our board and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office.\nFurther, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to the stockholders.\nThese provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, alone or together, could delay or deter hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. Any provision of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Holders of our common stock are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.", "PERMNO": 17322, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "IPICQ"}
